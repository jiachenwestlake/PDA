i 'm not sure why sony which now owns i dream of jeannie decided to colorize the first season of this series whatever the reason you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on that the original version of the first season is worth a lot more the reason for that is simple i dream of jeannie was originally broadcast in and for a television fan like myself that 's the only way to watch the first season the episodes themselves are just as i remember seeing them since i was n't around in 1965 i 'm pretty sure i 've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here but to me they 're still pretty good the theme music in my opinion is every bit as good as the second theme introduced when jeannie went to color in 1966. the one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that sony stripped off the old screen gems animation from the end of every episode that logo was attached to so many classic shows from the and and it is consistenly rated along with viacom 's old blue v of doom as the scariest logo in the history of television the new sony outro does n't pack the same punch still if you liked jeannie way back when you 'll love it now especially since you can watch it anytime you like without commercial interruption ||| 1

i wanted to do a grad school paper on something i was interested in researching and i picked after working for an underground magazine i 'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that i was too young to understand being born in i visited the university of in chicago interviewed underground artists and went to breaking shows in the illinois area although i thought i was very familiar with after working with this magazine i realized i knew nothing so when i was given the chance to do my research paper i knew that i would be able to learn even more than i already knew from working for the magazine i watched the three parts of beef '' first and saw an ad for this movie in the extras section honestly the first thing that caught my eye was how gorgeous wiggles was but then after fully watching the preview i realized this was the perfect movie for me to find out more about breaking this movie documented the founding members discussed the four elements of gave a lot of background information on kool herc and grandmaster flash talked about the different techniques in breaking the label breakdancing '' the media 's dilution of breaking the first movies that breaking was showcased in new breaking groups just a bunch of firsts '' it was a great reference for my paper i enjoyed watching it and i could watch it over and over again i have a lot of respect for the founders because without them headz would n't have this beautiful culture to express ourselves physically mentally and verbally ||| 1
honestly i was n't certain about this film in fact at first i actually believed it was related to chocolate '' i was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised upon first viewing i did not laugh as much as the second time yes i tend to watch a film twice for i know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories i can be more relaxed and open minded the second time second viewing was a belly full of laughter this is the best lesbian comedy i have ever seen the acting was wonderful and the film was fast paced now that i decided that this film is exceptional it was time to put it to the test on others mostly women 20 's 80 's years some men each person i shared this film with either loaning it or viewing it together all responded similarly this is a hysterically funny film '' what is even more amazing is the brief allotted time the director accomplished in completing the filming process about days congratulations sometimes a tight budget can produce a true work of art many short films i have seen on the spiritual cinema circle '' also have numerous low budget wonderful productions hoorah for the film art genius i applaud the entire talented cast and crew especially actress christine cox her performance was exceptionally wonderful i would like to see her in more comedies she 's a natural i fell in love with her '' and i am straight gal as are all of the actresses except for frances a must see funny film i always wondered why the comedy male gay films always had that edge of humor when the lesbian films appeared more serious we need more films that are as pleasurable and diversified as better than chocolate '' thanks bunches ||| 1

i had been aware that once there was a show called show '' starring bob and david and that it had been on hbo but i had never been compelled to buy any of their dvds until this weekend when the power of satan um compelled me to pick up the first two seasons all i got ta say is praise satan for leading me to this glory ! the first season comprised of four episodes is fantastic with flashes of brilliance on the gay porno video '' but it 's the second season that really will make you a fan such oddities as woodycooks only the british can fly comedy writers the iguana and jeepers creepers unleash the funny like you 'd never believe show proves that there is a market for intelligent hilarious sketch comedy on cable or in the case of kith and monty python imported from other countries but show is homegrown it 's comedy at a breakneck speed and there 's never a dull moment in either season you 'll laugh you 'll cry you 'll learn how to fight crime with a crime stick '' and ice cream and enjoy products while your business goes to hell led by a red balloon the security guard and i shared something in common me ! ||| 1
this comedy volume is absolutely great while i 'm a fan of the series i thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next definately do n't watch season 3 before seeing these seasons because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree it does n't move as fast as some comedy out there but it all fits together better than most of what is on tv today ||| 1
i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on it 's been some time now and i plan to buy it waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father i did n't realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon a heartbreaking beautifully acted and film rings true to life they certainly do n't make movies like this anymore and it 's a shame ||| 1
some classic episodes indeed all in the family broke new ground in television sitcoms the world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households archie bunker 's old fashioned values were being challenged it is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced archie bunker 's views were organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone certainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970 's carol o'connor jean stapelton sally struthers and rob reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times all in the family spawned off may other great shows such as the jeffersons maude and indirectly good times this first season was certainly a reverred one just look at it with an open mind ||| 1
great movie great actors for such a sad part of the history ! it is great to see in this movie some men who really existed especially stonewall '' jackson we do n't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction but at the end of the day it 's not very important because the historical interest is preserved ||| 1

i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation the cover appealled to me for these reasons and i admit i was not at all disappointed in the movie the scenery was indeed spectacular the underwater scenes were clear crisp and just what the doctor ordered even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful ok enough of the shallow stuff the movie was indeed much like the 70 's flick the deep '' which i enjoyed back then as well the characters of jared and sam were pretty believable poor honest and happy folks most of us would love to really be this happy let 's face it ! the introduction of bryce played by scott caan really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers twists etc overall the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives would i want to deal with tiger sharks no but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring job every day ||| 1
see this it will shock you move you thrill you excite you chill you freak you out it 's one amazing strange movie it really takes a while to understand it at times but it has many valuable lessons one can learn witherspoons performance is shattering and remarkable among other things a great movie will be seen more times then i can count the next times i play it in my playe ||| 1

my 2 year old loves watching the dvd as well as listening to the cd in the car i have to admit that i have memorized all of the songs on the cd and the dances on the dvd too they are very catchy and i find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around ! the lyrics are really cute and the beats are great simple music but very creative i signed up for updates on laurie berkner 's website so i can find out she ever comes to town so my daughter and i of course can go see her she is a great alternative to barney and all of the other commercial characters who i do n't care much for i have bought this combo for all of my friends who have kids ||| 1

i loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3. where is it i hope that it is released soon it seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending ! a little unfair to the consumer do n't you think ! it is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is is that correct ||| 1

this is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves the storyline is great but this should have been the last dvd things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over 20 that 's bogus dvds can fit way more episodes on a single disc and it 's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately the cowboy bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start then dropped down to 4. now it 's just getting worse at this point i 'm starting to regret buying the stand alone complex series instead of renting it i am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out though throughout the series i think disc 4 was my favorite ||| 1

i quite enjoyed watching this film which is why i give it four stars even though i think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic so why did i like it joan cusack matt dillon kevin kline in that order and also a passably funny script at least one that is well structured for a viewing experience joan cusack is wonderful here her at her wayward fiance after he stands her up is fantastic and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street screaming is this the twilight zone '' at which point she collapses on the hood of matt dillon 's car in her wedding dress no less well that scene is adorable especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of shakespeare 's romeo and juliet a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity yes here is the heart of the film so i can not comprehend another viewer 's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film she 's obviously going to marry the movie star and get to eat cheetos into the bargain matt dillon is as ever the essence of cuteness and a much more desirable husband than kevin um i mean howard kevin kline does a decent job of mimicking howard a repressed gay man but it still feels like mimicking rather than acting here is also where the problems begin i guess wearing a means you are gay and similarly the barbra streisand gag is beaten to death and beyond how many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like barbra ! ! come on ! also kline 's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture not only is it not enough it 's really kind of humiliating nonetheless the final scene does give holland 's opus '' a run for its money and i ca n't deny it i did really have fun watching this movie it 's basically a sound little production well structured reasonably well written and kevin kline can dance ||| 1
i 'm not big on anime but watching one episode got me hooked the voices the animation the story the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch samurai champloo each and every episode just engrosses you deeper and deeper into the story line leaving you wanting for more ||| 1
if you are bored with kurosawa 's faithful decpition of historical samurai and who would be if you think the samurai genre has been overused and outdated then get ready for the remix version of the age old genre samurai champloo directed by shinichiro watanabe the man who brought us cowboy bebop and 2 shorts in animatrix with character design by kazuto nakazawa kill bill vol 1 fame we are treated to a world that would have made the clan feel right at home the action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other one follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play the music is all modern no moody asian flare here the story is about the adventures of these two warriors as they escort a pessant girl across japan in search of a samurai who 's only distinquishing characteristic is that he smells like sunflowers '' lack of money food and patience is a recipe for disaster and wacky in this rated the equivilent of r in the us for bloody violence and language a must for any samurai genre fan ||| 1

the good earth '' must be considered a milestone movie '' as yet there is no dvd but one packed with about the making of this film would be especially welcome there was no oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939 otherwise the good earth '' would have 'taken home ' that award ! the lovely luise ranier did win best actress '' award the 1937 movie was based on pearl buck 's novel that won the pulitzer prize in 1932. interest in the good earth '' was revived in fall 2004 when it was selected for oprah 's book club '' perhaps women 's rights advocates should also give it a boost the story is about china in the a simple farmer wang lung is 'given ' by his father the slave for his bride i do not remember much from childhood about this film but i definitely do not recall paul muni having such a mouthful of teeth ! special effecrs ! luise ranier had won an oscar the previous year for her role in the ziegfield follies '' what a contrast ! here she is the completely docile loyal wife as someone wrote she was bound to her husband in eternal servitude '' and her devotion was betrayed partly through the machinations of uncle '' at every time of crisis in the story along comes groan ! the crafty manipulatve uncle walter connolly who whines wheedles inserting humor into the script and at the same time destroying family amity from the internet movie database are the prophetic words of former slave when i go back in that house it will be with my son in my arms i 'll have a red coat on him and red flower trousers and a hat with a gilded buddha and shoes and i 'll go into the kitchen where i spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe and i 'll show myself and my son to all of them '' smiles contented wang lung well now i i have n't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house '' is n't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago i found the quality of framed camera shots surprising the production of many scenes quite amazing read susan wong 's wonderfully perceptive review on today 's do n't seem to care about true life '' documentation in films but animation could n't convince as the locusts do ! that tired word awesome '' truly fits this vintage film the choking drought famine the beautiful 'condensed ' story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm and the terrifying scenes of revolutionary uprisings reviewer mchaiku hails this film and others that made an impact on my childhood ! ||| 1

what a cast ! mark wahlberg reese witherspoon william petersen amy brenneman and alyssa milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl witherspoon and her seemingly perfect boyfriend wahlberg of course the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance william petersen csi is outstanding as the witherspoon 's concerned father who has way too many issues himself this film is a hidden gem buy it you will not be disappointed ||| 1
otto preminger 's exodus is a very well made film this is a big film and director preminger is a master at handling films of this scale he is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature well that is preminger 's style straighforward and technically proficient movie making ||| 1
i got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college good grief since when is a musical ever realistic especially one that is geared to kids hello ! ! it 's not supposed to be realistic ! if you expect realism go elsewhere but if you want to have some fun with a great message woven in then watch this movie kids love it mine do along with anyone else i 've talked to and the message is just terrific it 's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes dislikes hobbies no matter what anyone else thinks i love it ! i ca n't even begin to say how much better this is than grease '' the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be happy '' relax with your kids go get some popcorn and have some fun with the wildcats kids from highschool musical ||| 1

this is as most critics agreed the best of the trilogy abrams ' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish including a few twists along the way i was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film the only thing i did n't like the short pause in the middle of the film probably for a change between the dual layers very annoying ! ||| 1

there is not enough footage on the feud with macho man randy savage i prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story what did the macho man think about it unfortunately we can never get to hear from ms elizabeth would these be included in a future macho man dvd set i was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy especially in front of a huge live audience including kids i was totally shocked when i first saw that on tv back in the 80 's yes that 's hardcore deadly scary hardcore ! that should not happen in the first place the story involving steamboat is well covered it is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be it is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing there should be a line which should not be crossed how can a real heavyweight guitar be used by honky tonk to hit jake over the head human error hm nowadays tripe h is using a hammer to hit others on the head i guess a guitar is not a big deal by today 's standard enough is enough we do n't need accidents ! they may be an unevitable part of sports but not part of entertainment '' ||| 1
i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson i had never really seen topher grace outside of 'that 70 's show ' which i never kept up with on a regular basis i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd grace plays a 26 executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend he 's become such a machine in a competivie world that he 's loses his way in life i was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too one of mentor 's has told me repeatedly that the can be one of the roughest times in life so many things are going at once on so many levels to me this movie captured that paul weitz did a great job writing this the cast was exquisite ||| 1
i 've been waiting for this to come out on dvd since i first saw it back in july i still ca n't understand why the critics just did n't get this one this has to be one of the best second films ever made in a trilogy the addition of davy jones was brilliant it made the film much darker and more dramatic johnny deep was superb as usual i still ca n't believe that the film made 400 million dollars domestically and over 1 billion dollars worldwide it 's surreal but everything about this movie was so on point that it 's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film i enjoyed this one more than the original i thought the story was more interesting on this occasion although you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of geoffrey rush 's character he and depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him it was a huge void to fill but enter bill nighy as davy jones and all is well i guess that 's one reason why dead man 's chest '' woks the way it does billy nighy gives an performance and when you add in orlando bloom and keira knightly it 's money in the bank the only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original star wars '' yes i prefer pirates '' over tlotr although perhaps my comments are premature since at world end '' has n't even been released yet should that be a dud then of course the whole thing falls apart but here 's hoping that the third time is a charmer if you own the first pirates '' on dvd then you have to get this do n't miss out ||| 1
i 'd give 4 stars for this dvd release the movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies to relate the atmosphere of an old 60 's soviet eastern '' is not easy to an american viewer and i believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice besides that it 's a must have particularly for any russian ||| 1

leave it to the coen brothers to make werner heisenberg 's uncertainty principle the crux of a film noir and darned if they do n't make a good case for it in the man who was n't there '' typically they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who ca n't even remember heisenberg 's name nebbish barber ed crane billy bob thornton makes the only decisive and dishonest action of his life and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several mostly bystanders in the man who was n't there '' the phrase decisive action '' is an oxymoron everything crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance everything that happens from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face changes everything forever and always for the worse set in 1949 in santa rosa a tip of the hat to hitchcock and shadow of a doubt '' perhaps the man who was n't there '' looks perfect like every other coen film it 's a marvel of production design and the genius photographer roger deakins nails to a tree the dusty look of such classic noirs as double indemnity '' and out of the past '' thematically however the man who was n't there '' resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant much better acted remake of edgar ulmer 's detour '' in which the characters drift in a sartrean hell totally the victims of fate but whereas detour '' is more than the sum of its parts the man who was n't there '' is less the coen brothers may believe in chance but on the screen they leave nothing to chance so that everything in the man who was n't there '' is too perfect in the end the film has the same overstudied clinical quality that afflicts every coen film except fargo '' it must be admitted though that only one coen film '' the hudsucker proxy '' is ruined by that quality the acting is as superb as in any coen film thornton in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense hangdog gravity there are also glittering supporting performances by frances mcdormand as thornton 's philandering wife doris james gandolfini as her paramour and boss jon polito as a shady businessman michael badalucco as thornton 's motormouth scarlett johansson as the teenager thornton chastely fancies and especially tony shalhoub nearly stealing the picture as freddy riedenschneider defense attorney extraordinaire ||| 1
i was not privy to the world of christopher guest until a friend of mine told me that if i liked dead gorgeous ' then i would flip over any of guest 's films the video store only had one in and that was in show ' and i 'm sooooo glad they had it this film has to be one of the funniest films i 've ever seen a complete riot from beginning to end as a true ' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to ' the mayflower dog show the film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy there 's jennifer coolidge and patrick crenshaw play leslie and sherri ann ward cabot total spoof on the whole anna nicole smith scandal owners of a prize winning poodle who 's won in show ' 2 years straight and with the help of lesbian handler christy cummings jane lynch hopefully she 'll win for a third then there 's harlan pepper christopher guest himself a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist and there 's power comic couple eugene levy and catherine o'hara who play the flecks owners of a terrier who struggle with flecks long line of previous lovers there are lovers stefan scott michael mckean john michael higgins who spoil their shih tzu 's and each other but finally we have the star couple of the show the neurotic meg and hamilton swan parker posey michael hitchcock owners of beatrice and beautiful yet disturbed and ' weimaraner who 's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex their antics arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film and their chemistry is pure brilliance the film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken way to serious and with fred willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish ||| 1
a great look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us this with the more recent kennedy biographies for a wider sobering context this is the sort of thing that the bush administration should have watched before deciding to invade iraq ||| 1

ferris bueller matthew broderick is a kind of hero to every aged young adult out there he 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be really he acts like he does n't have a care in the world and lives life to fullest the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye alan ruck a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris in this film ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another sick '' day for him his ninth to be exact in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process another antithesis of ferris is his sister jeannie jennifer grey who suspects something is up as does the dean of students ed rooney jeffrey jones it 's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen for instance ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days it 's amazing people like his parents who are most easily duped would think that this one sick kid when in reality he 's having a ball however knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile ferris and cameron bail out ferris ' girl sloane mia sara with a dead grandmother ploy and together the trio spend the day doing the town in chicago driving the gt convertible oh yeah ! this movie has a special message and feeling to it that 's as old as time it 's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life for after all as our hero says life moves pretty fast if you do n't stop to take a look every once in a while you might miss it '' that 's the moral of the story really bueller bueller bueller '' not here but he 'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day ||| 1
highly enjoyable tale of the life of marty maher the irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become west point 's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years despite personal tragedies and through two world wars maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished army officers ' academy including future legends like omar bradley and dwight eisenhower tyrone power is excellent and compelling as he portrays maher from young idealist to elderly sage irish accent intact all the way the scenery and west point pageantry is fun to watch although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the military academy interestingly there 's not really all that much football in this film there 's a little but it 's mainly the story of maher and his family and the young men he came to love like his own sons with the maureen o'hara as maher 's irish wife mary giving a radiant performance sentimental in that way of course but the legendary director john ford working with a cast made up of many of his favorites always puts a bite behind the sweetness ||| 1
when i read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts i thought yeah right '' but you really can pick and chose and combine what you want you can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio it is up to you or you can choose from the basic low medium or high intesity workouts this is a great workout dvd and denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part i 'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home ||| 1
pbs did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together it covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films the documentary includes many interview pieces with kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like also there are comments from noted japanese film historian donald richie as a kurosawa fan watching this on pbs when it aired the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour it is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century ||| 1
this is a work of genius it is creative original funny and well done that being said it is probably not for everyone this wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from shakespeare 's hamlet these are the stars of the show in hamlet they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with hamlet 's melancholia they appear briefly and are gone the last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead they are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince in this work the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them the spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them as they discuss existential questions the tragedy of hamlet plays out around them it is quite funny but some background helps it helps a great deal if you are comfortable with elizabethan speech whole pieces are lifted from shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style it helps if you are familiar with hamlet that makes understanding the context easier it is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn it 's is fun ||| 1
nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even william shatner would envy and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical as anybody who has seen this show knows the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for british comedy although as children '' of the three stooges americans are i think accustomed to somewhat comedy for those who do n't know this series it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids i would n't let mine watch with me until they are at least 20 by which time they will probably find this material boring if you are assembling a comedy collection however this series fills a unique niche my only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate it does n't even come in a box but rather in a little '' package which is neither aesthetic nor practical ca n't stack nor particularly protective it is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them i chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape works fine ||| 1
i am a huge anime fan and this is by far the best lem me just say god i ca n't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is it inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy the whole series is actually based on a true story in japan a few hundred years ago the entire population of wolves in japan became extinct there are people there even today that report wolf sightings occasionally SMILE if you 're a fan of wolves or looking for something a little different check this dvd out ! the musics great the drawing is perfect not just a random bunch of stills like most animes but actual movement ! you get 4 episodes per dvd each is a little over 20 minutes long this dvd includes 19. a dream of an oasis this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep kiba finds a place where he is truly happy and wonders if he has finally found paradise 20. consciously this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series it has gorgeous music and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever just brilliant 21. battle 's red glare orcom 's men are fighting against an enemy and the wolves are caught in the middle we see a lot of blue in this episode she 's so cute as a puppy SMILE and cher 22. pieces of a shooting star the group decides to cross a sea of ice but it turns out not to be such a good idea toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff i ca n't say enough about this series unless you 've seen the whole thing you ca n't judge it it 's made by the same people as cowboy beebop '' and this dvd is preparing us for the typical bones conclusion SMILE the next dvd is way sad and very depressing no matter how tough you are you will be crying by the end ||| 1
okay when i heard about the brat pack movie and music collection i was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of the high school reunion collection which was released several years ago both sets were released by universal fear not i am here to tell you about the differences the first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies like it 's closest cousin the high school reunion collection the brat pack movie and music collection includes the exact same '' the breakfast club '' sixteen candles '' and weird science '' the cover art on the dvd 's is the same no new bonus material with each film that i detected it has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off no one even really pegged this acting group the brat pack '' until around 1985. molly ringwald was one of the best known brat pack members and sixteen candles '' helped to start the whole brat pack phenom but no one ever considered weird science '' a brat pack movie trust me i remember the 80 's it always seemed like it would make more sense to include st elmo 's fire '' or pretty in pink '' in with this set this is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included the music cd includes the following '' true '' by spandau ballet tenderness '' by general public if you leave '' by omd weird science '' by oingo boingo oh yeah '' by yello which was in ferris bueller 's day off '' pretty in pink by the psychedelic furs do n't you forget about me '' by simple minds and i go crazy '' by flesh for lulu why include music from pretty in pink '' and not include the movie on to the packaging the packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning i own over 100 tv on dvd and box sets and nothing is like this the dvd 's are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the dvd 's are in sleeves instead of jewel cases on the back page of the binder is a pop quiz for the most part it is very similar to the highschool reunion collection but it 's nice to have the bonus cd and the cool packaging however it would have been nice if universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection one must assume they must not own the rights to pretty in pink '' it 's listed as a parmount dvd because that is easily one of the best known brat pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term brat pack associated with it ||| 1
one of the many reasons we love movies is how they make us feel how they make us react dave '' a wonderful ivan reitman political confection is one of those rare movies we watch over and over again to get that warm fuzzy we all need from time to time kevin kline shines as the president 's sweet natured slightly goofy stand in after the the chief executive suffers a major stroke while boffing an aide the rest of the supporting cast also turn in exceptional performances as does the film score music which frames the film beautifully the relationships between dave and the first lady as well as dave and the head secret service man at the white house are especially touching i absolutely love this movie you will too ||| 1
the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders the answer presented by material in the film is an unflinching no there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three the film 's strengths are that it does n't preach at least not in an overly wrought narrative and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims i can understand the pain and confusion of the victim 's families what is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them the victims ' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film at one point the mother of the byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone i hate them i hate them and the mother 's that bore them '' is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child no quite natural really but the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started i imagine the bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in i 'll have to ask brad pitt what he thinks about it some time on the issue of the prosecution they had next to nothing a very questionable confession from a terrified kid jessie with a 72 iq hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard damien bragging about the murder but have no proof a knife found behind damien 's house which does n't match the wounds on the bodies and the assertion that because damien read about wicca he must be a satanist to look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film jessie a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world his iq is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low iq damien is the key to everything in this film though the defense made the key mistake of letting damien take the stand for two reasons the first reason is that damien appears to have add and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no 's the second reason and the most important is that damien is obviously extremely bright normally this would n't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world damien scared them all of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other more sinister and shocking suspects that needed to be pursued the war rages on for the west memphis three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it and terrifying to think they didn't ||| 1
if you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for a beautiful mind '' or even lord of the rings '' you 've missed the boat this movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what 's so great about it see this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh to gross you out to surprise you with its clever twists of plot to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates ' treasures ||| 1
all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie this is a very well made movie with perfectly competent performances the tone is quite serious and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up but then there are many people who loved titanic which i found utterly depressing more to the point though who cares about the problems of these rich kids not me the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful and if you enjoy this film check out less than zero another gloomy but solid underrated film the worst film is bright lights big city do n't say i did n't warn you ! ||| 1
i fell in love with this movie me and my husband and that is funny because usually we do n't have the same taste in movie ||| 1
this is a wonderful movie to keep the kids and quite possibly yourself entertained during an holiday i laughed i cried really i did and i just really enjoyed it ||| 1
i 'll admit that i 'm a to the madea '' series finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece creator tyler perry and his the opinionated never lit by the way madea '' have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans mostly nationwide though the stories feature the characters the belligerent teenager the devoted wife the straying husband the vixens the lotharios etc and situations infidelity promiscuity straying from the church comedic funerals obnoxious and overbearing family members perry 's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story 's ending dependent upon divine intervention making things right some of the acting performances are a little over the top and the musical selections though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists are weak in the lyrics department however as a whole the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by hollywood and is having great success on both the stage and screen this compilation lets the viewer experience revisit those stage shows ||| 1
inliked the film in the theater and i like the film now the plot does not drag and does not bore ||| 1
i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine the actors well chosen the script very good and harrison ford 's acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october '' or crimson tide '' whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew 's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian ||| 1
kids will be kids ! within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive honorable and brave these raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of love '' risk becomes only the next step susan sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength courage wit and willingness to go up against the big tough bad guys with all the money and power tommy lee jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power fools ||| 1
this is an excellent movie if you like war flicks it made me angry being from the vietnam generation also it shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men the acting from all the cast was top class i highly recommend this movie it may be slow at first but the action later is amazing ||| 1
richard dryfuss and holly hunter are fabulous in this wonderful remake of a guy named joe '' full of great flying laughs with john goodman and a special appearance of audrey hepburn in her last film you 'll love it ||| 1
as you can tell from my other reviews i own a lot of kathy smith dvd 's the reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great and instruction she always cues from your point of view when she says left it 's your left which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen this step workout has 3 segments designed for beginner intermediate and advanced the beginner should stop after segment 1 and go to the cooldown the intermediate stepper should finish segments 1 and 2 and then proceed to the cooldown the advanced stepper can do all 3 segments before cooling down each segment gives you two options high impact power moves or low impact higher impact consists of modifying low impact moves to contain more jumps one person in each segment does the low impact moves so you can follow her segment 1 12 minutes long easy to follow basic stepping kathy and company use a springboard step but any step or even no step for beginners will work just fine segment 2 13 minutes long slightly more intense than segment 1 and more add on sequences after you 've been stepping 6 minutes kathy moves to squats and lunges which gives you a rest and lets your heartrate lower this is my only complaint about this video i wish she would have added this at the end of the entire video and continued cardio through the entire segement however this segment only lasts minutes so it 's not that big of a deal there is a heart rate check after this segment segment 3 12 minutes the step is switched to the other position for a bit more variety a few squats and leg lifts in sequence finish out this segment there is a 5 minute cooldown and a little bit of a stretch probably wo n't be adequate for most people after this workout she has a safety demonstration after the cooldown where she promotes the step she shows in the video but should be viewed by first time steppers to make sure they do it properly ||| 1
i 'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand you receive one of the greatest mgm musicals ever conceived and it 's bolstered by quite nice extras that much you can be assured of i 'm writing this particular review because of warner insistance on using fragile cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases the problem with these warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case rendering it 's capability the actually hold the disc useless and unlike the plastic cases the warner ones can not be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer good luck with that by the way another problem lies with the fact that it 's made out of cardboard when you remove the stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover this can occur even when you 're carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off the reason i feel the need to mention this is i own dozens of warner movies and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one not likely greedy to be fair warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases the film noir and gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases but titles like kiss me kate '' rebel without a cause '' broadway melody of 1940 '' and even wizard of oz '' are still only available in these sad cardboard cases ||| 1
i loved this play it provided drama suspense comedy inspiration and great music tyler perry has done it again sit back relax and enjoy the message ||| 1
i just watched this movie last night i came across the title on someone 's myspace and being a jared leto fan i wanted to watch it i had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting riveting is the very least i can say about this film it is as the amazon editorial review puts it a tour through hell '' this film makes you think the fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but i keep wondering is it so far fetched how many people are there that actually do escape addictions you might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another during the film i kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground some little piece of hope left i was wrong the film did n't depict drug use the way that i had expected to see it the way i had seen it depicted in countless other films all of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure personally i found it painful to watch there were moments when i actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch i think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film the truth is that i could n't stop watching the film put me directly in the shoes of the addict i felt like the addicts in the film my hands sweaty and my heart pounding i could n't close my eyes i want to see it again sometime i would like to watch it with my husband i bought the movie before i had ever watched it the first time the film was painfully realistic genuinely graphic appalling and appealing at the same exact time a must see overall i think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection personally it is probably one of the best movies i have ever watched i think the acting in the movie was outstanding the direction was genius and the plot was amazingly horrific all in all this is an 5 star film ||| 1
a deeply emotional film about addiction love and family just to some but when you watch this film you take something with you something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted life each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending really depressing movie but worth a look at least once marlon wayans and jennifer connelly were extremely good but ellen burstyn broke my heart her performance rocked ||| 1
i teared up when i heard the music from the theme song to the electric company for the first time in 30 years i grew up with this show and now my children are learning from it too thanks to whoever arranged to have it released on dvd it was and still is a great show ||| 1
i agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say baby einstein videos however i still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay my two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although i agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland i love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the dvd my son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days the video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing ||| 1
according to imdb moulin rouge '' was shot in 1.37 not widescreen therefore you 're not losing that much to view this in 1.33 full screen format ||| 1
i really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work i 'm a photographer but not this line of work it was an interesting glimpse into their lives i wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it ||| 1
one of the most beautiful and sympathetic movies ever made about wolves alaska and the inuit i could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it a analyst who just happens to be in the right place at the right time he has his doubts early on is chosen to go north to investigate the arctic wolf and its impact on the caribou population along the way he encounters a host of intriguing characters including a entrepreneurial bush pilot looking to make some sort of big score a number of wacky bit players who i can easily imagine were not actors but the real deal and every bit as eccentric as they appeared and an endearingly sage old inuit of few words but many eloquent silences the investigator tyler is not at all sure that he 's up to the demands of the job but forges ahead regardless played with practical flair by charles martin smith a perfect choice for the lead here i would be at a loss and if left alone on a frozen lake in alaska as his character tyler is tyler takes it all in stride trusting it will all be good in the morning even though it is established early that for all the fact that he was chosen for this mission he goes into it with a terror of wolves after the assistance of the old inuit man in getting centered on his path and the abrupt disappearance of his benefactor who has a way of coming and going that magicians would envy tyler finds himself deep in the bush country and immersed in the world of wolves before he realizes how completely they have taken him over knowledge and observance quickly negates his fear and he is brought to a serenity of spirit and understanding of his place in the world that makes me wish i had the courage and stamina to go out and try it too a caveat there is a culinary moment in this movie that might cause the squeamish some distress do what i did at the crucial moment look at the ceiling or recite to yourself it 's only chocolate it 's only chocolate '' you 'll know when it gets close they do n't spring it on you and it is just chocolate highly recommended for the whole family oh one more caveat if adults offend you briefly and not flagrantly overt then maybe this is n't your movie ||| 1
about a young scientist played by charles martin smith who goes to the arctic to study wolves their survival and their effect on the caribou herds he proves they are not killing the caribou as it had been assumed he is a fledgling in the wilds but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves he notices the wolves eating mice and begins to do the same himself a supreme irony in this disney film the first half is excellent compelling and beautiful to watch but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a bad guy message and a confusing indian mysticism presentation it 's wonderfully photographed though and the soundtrack is stunning ||| 1

after spinal tap this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown but like st it is right on these wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it 's satire it 's real if you hate even the idea of folk music skip it or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people if you were there i was it 's a real hoot enanny ! sadly here in california they were to be found en masse at every local 99 cents only stores i realize this is not for everyone but neither was spinal tap give it a try ||| 1
when you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the 's generation you 're talking about paddy chayefsky 's brilliantly written black comedy hospital ' which was released in a contemporary dysfunctional urban hospital serves as the microcosm of america 's failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century but the mental and emotional illnesses as well george scott stars in the role of herbert bock hospital administrator bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity his wife has left him he 's estranged from his children and he 's in the grips of a crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question when a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad with great performances by george scott and the lovely brit diana rigg hospital ' is a film that will elicit discussion and debate watch it with a friend ||| 1
it 's a more vulnerable patton in a white coat running a hospital and it 's all great fun with a good story from an script you have to love it when scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow you him to finish her off with there are brave men dying out there ! '' ||| 1

most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is i am a long time fan and had seen rattle and hum but did n't get around to purchasing the dvd until late 2005. the fact that the music is wonderful is a given but the cinematography is just astounding i love how you get to see everything from every point of view you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage including the breathtaking sea of fans you get to see what the fans see the spectacular lighting and silhouettes you get to hear what the guys think and feel as well as on and of course you get the passionate music the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to i could n't ask for more ||| 1
it is a wonderful complement to my lucy collection the tango scene is some of her best physical comedy ! ! ||| 1
the story of a young award winner of a filmmaker 's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get his '' first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by christopher spinal tap guest it 's a cynical and hysterical look at how hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis unlike many of favorable reviewers i 'm not a fan of christopher guest 's later works and that 's not just because i 'm envious of him being married to jamie leigh curtis lucky dog i do n't find guffman or best of show more than mildly amusing at best save for bob balaban in guffman when sparky comes back i almost bust a gut sometimes artists do their best work up front i like woody allen 's first three pictures the best what 's up tiger lily take the money and run bananas i think this is the case here guest hit gold great script terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast a near genius i 'm gon na steal one of the other reviewer 's word here because it 's so perfect kudos and thanks turn '' by jt walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history alas another great '' dying so soon before his time like warren oates and robert shaw fabulous work by martin short teri hatcher j t walsh jennifer jason leigh fran drescher dan schneider jason gould wakter olkewicz and seriously i could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines there are tons of people in this sublime comedy its only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene that comes off as way too cloying other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of hollywood someone said comparing this to the player was like comparing bagger vance to caddyshack i 'm not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be caddyshack is a classic and so the big picture i am a big big fan of altman and the big picture is even par with the player if either were more biting i would give the nod to the big picture though richard e grant 's performance is almost as good as walsh 's nick 's kevin bacon flights of fancy are hysterical this is an inspired and unfortunately comedy ||| 1
first of all i have lost count of the ammount of times i have seen this movie but every time i watch it i get goose bumps this is how affective the movie is george scott of patton '' fame plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and scott begins to investige the house 's history this is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film this movie is all about atmosphere there are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays this film does not need to gross the viewer out the changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters you are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease there is nothing in your face '' about the scares this film is for fans of the 1960 's film the haunting '' or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story do n't even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and i guarantee you 'll watch it more than once i have recommended it to many people and i never heard a negative comment for the full effect wait until night to watch it and then watch it alone see how many times you glance over your shoulder ||| 1
one of the productions of which he is the most proud robert redford 's all the president 's men should be required viewing and the book should be required reading for all who aspire to the profession of journalist redford was fascinated with the story of two young untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the watergate until it led to the highest office in the united states redford 's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary so he followed as the story developed he got to know bob woodward and carl bernstein when they were still at ground level still unsure as to where this would all lead but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics redford has always been a political animal with a reporter 's instinct and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the american political climate earlier he and director michael ritchie had made the candidate a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most of men or women and a film well worth your time it took two years of hard work to get all the president 's men off the ground it was turned down by several studios with the excuse that people were tired of watergate but he was finally able to get warner to say yes provided redford himself would star dustin hoffman was enlisted to play carl bernstein redford 's old friend jason robards won an oscar as washington post ben bradlee jack warden was cast as editor harry rosenfeld martin balsam was editor howard simons jane alexander was judy hoback bookkeeper to the committee to the president ned beatty was martin dardis who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence stephen collins was hugh sloan whose wife debbie played by meredith baxter kept his conscience working on the right side robert walden who would go on the the fine television series lou grant was dirty trickster donald segretti and hal holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story the mysterious deep throat who helped woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall of course we now know that deep throat was the fbi 's assistant director mark felt an old friend of woodward 's and a man torn between his loyalty to the fbi and the need to shed light on some very dirty redford asked alan pakula to direct and gordon willis to handle the cinematography and they crafted a look that is part documentary part thriller if you get a chance also see pakula and willis ' the parallax view starring warren beatty another outstanding scary political film william goldman who won an oscar for butch cassidy and the sundance kid wrote the tight exciting screenplay for which he won again this was actually the fourth time redford and goldman had worked together goldman also adapted donald westlake 's the hot rock a very funny caper film and the poignant the great waldo pepper which was out for a short time on dvd in pan and scan but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful widescreen splendor universal where are you the efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes all the president 's men a smashing success it succeeds as an exciting suspenseful procedural as a statement on the neccessity of a free press as a character study and as a great the dvd set is the one to buy the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp clean aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by redford himself the second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film on woodward and bernstein and on deep throat there is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film and an interview with jason robards on the dinah shore show a deserved landmark in film and in journalism all the president 's men is a and for all who aspire to what journalism should be a in our darkest hour when all seems obfuscated and hopeless it reminds us that light can be brought to bear people can make a difference ||| 1
peter palmer and leslie parrish are excellent in this fun politically skewering musical comedy the songs are upbeat fun especially put em back '' sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates ||| 1
lil abner is a delightful with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals this film version of the broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on dvd in a beautiful print with it 's comic book coloring it 's also superbly cast the film 's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play lil abner and daisy mae peter palmer who starred in the broadway show and leslie parrish but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles it 's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as abner anyway although daisy mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era it 's a shame neither palmer or parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals as the dogpatch crowd might say it 's true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable notably jublian cornpone '' a typical day in dogpatch '' and put 'em back the way they was '' which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young valerie harper rhoda '' and beth howland alice '' but most of the songs are and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original broadway show jerry lewis has a funny cameo and the gorgeous julie newmar and stella stevens have amusing secondary roles most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here including donna douglas as the busty hillbilly girl a few years before becoming famous as one on the beverly hillbillies who wants to broaden our horizons '' and is informed by mammy yokum superbly played by billie hayes that she her horizons is broaden enough there 's quite a bit of political satire in here as well with politicans with such apt names as mayor dogmeat and senator jack phigbound and the sadie hawkins day sequence a dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it 's own with many high schools for years having an annual sadie hawkins dance '' in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered acceptable '' is a lot of fun but then so is the movie as a yoakam says when they really mean it i has spoken ! '' ||| 1
i saw this movie before i read the books the books are much funnier and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film still i liked the film and especially baby sunny i thought jim carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions as always brought the character to life i think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film the essence of the story was captured and is entertaining but i do recommend reading the series before or after watching the film ||| 1
haunted castle '' and alien adventure '' are great but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of encounter in the third dimension '' makes it better than the other two the film is an excellent way of showing how started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in other than the entire movie itself i do wish the mine ride was longer though the one which ends with the big round stone ball slamming into the tunnel and there was more shown of the experience sure the jules verne journey to the center of the earth '' ride certainly makes up for it but the effects in the shorter example were awesome like the bats best of all the film does n't look all that dated cgi wise for a 1998 production now i 've definitely got to get the sequel misadventures in '' dvd noticed something stupid in the credits for encounter '' instead of saying cassandra peterson as elvira mistress of the dark '' it redundantly reads elvira as elvira mistress of the dark '' unlike the other imax films this one is good either in stereo depth form or wise of course the best is since that is the whole point of the story anyway i highly recommend this movie to all collectors ||| 1
that this film is dedicated to the memory of david maysles should tell you all you need to know about what 's in store along with his brother albert david maysles created some of the most groundbreaking and fascinating documentaries of the 60 's and 70 's gim me shelter '' salesman '' grey gardens '' and joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky did a fabulous job here of carrying on the stylistic tradition the story of the poor and ward brothers is touching and engrossing despite the squalor in which they lived and this early 90 's legal case is a significant study in cultural assumptions and regional justice absorbing and worth owning this anniversary edition packs on a host of extras but just an fyi the product detail '' here on amazon that suggests that this 'stars ' connie chung is wildly inaccurate she did a piece on the ward brothers which we see them watching on a tv for a couple of minutes and that 's all she never physically appears in this film ||| 1
lets face it woodey allen has produced so much a few of his things sort of slip past some of us i have found this one did for many people it 's the kind of movie you watch more then once you have to wonder did the actors fill in some of those lines 'improv ' or were those allens ||| 1

the first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation it 's hard to even describe really but expect some disoriented backgrounds with some cgi thrown in the plot however is excellent the main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories he constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers they do what is called committing '' someone for their sins these first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great this anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there ||| 1

lady and the trap has been an enduring disney classic for 50 years now and it 's amazing how well it holds up after all that time the hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch this film is an example of disney animation at its classic best but calling lady and the tramp a great animated film is really selling it short it 's a great movie period lady 's idyllic life is shattered and bad boy tramp comes to her rescue while he begins his relationship with lady in the dog house sorry could n't resist he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end if you 've seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you 'll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans watch lady and the tramp and you 'll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years ||| 1
i have been a casual fan of the radio version of prairie home companion '' for decades although i seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time usually only if i am driving somewhere on a saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast i read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it and while most critics kind of liked it there were a few grumbles however i thought the film was excellent and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans i liked all the casting too robert altman is not a favorite director but when he is good he is very good as in and nashville '' when he is bad he is terrible but here i thought he done good same with garrison i trashed his recent novel in an amazon review but i liked him in this ||| 1
this is the best film i 've seen in perhaps six months or more the direction by director ferzan ozpetek is consistently interesting intriguing beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually the film is beautifully cut and the acting particularly by the fascinating giovanna mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also giovanna is first rate the story begins in a bakery during world war ii when davide veroli massimo girotti is a baker 's apprentice we see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the establishment but he is pounced upon by the baker they wrestle a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on davide 's hands as he runs out into the streets cut to modern times as giovanna and her husband filippo filippo nigro are crossing a bridge in the city they meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented he ca n't remember his name and he has no identification filippo takes pity on him and against his wife 's wishes takes him home with them to their apartment we know because of the man 's age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from world war ii but his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about giovanna 's brief affair with the man next door lorenzo raoul bova whose apartment window faces hers this is a love story a one which all great love stories should be in some sense since life itself is bittersweet it is framed by and contrasted with another love story that involving the older man from many years ago the tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man because the police can find out nothing about the old man and because giovanna 's heart softens toward him and because he is an elegant man of refinement especially in the pastry arts giovanna 's dream is to be a pastry chef the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship the old man and the young woman that 's enough of the plot the development the denouement and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense instead let me say that the feel of modern italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present the dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films this is the first film directed by ozpetek that i have seen but it wo n't be the last but see this for giovanna mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen ||| 1
this film is a real delight but it also has a message about our consumer culture do n't miss the deleted scenes i 'm sorry the director cut out the saints in the loft '' in particular what a powerful image ! but it 's there on the dvd so enjoy this marvelous charmer of a film ||| 1
this is a very good well made dvd which is fulled of idea to prepare dinner for your family ||| 1
i bought this at yep you guessed it the grocery store which was a very clever marketing concept on martha 's part there was only one dvd left it contained classic recipes for chicken beef fish vegetarian and other main dishes if you think you already know how to make classic everyday dishes such as meatloaf think again because martha 's variations may put a whole new twist on your usual standards her use of fresh herbs truly does make a difference and the glaze on her meatloaf was one i had n't tried before my family loved it there is also a section with bloopers yes martha 's mistakes or mishaps while filming a scene slips falls etc there are 12 different cupcake variations and an extra section on kitchen tips i learned plenty of new things from this section i have to admit that i looked at the bloopers section first intrigued by the idea of actually seeing martha make and i only wish there were more of those they were funny especially the one showing martha pulling an carrot from her garden you 'll have to buy the dvd to see the rest it is a very short section however then i watched the dvd from start to finish and marveled at the quality of the production as well as how much information was packed into this dvd from start to finish each recipe was demonstrated clearly i intend to use this one with my youngest child because it is a perfect introduction to some classic recipes from roast chicken to meatloaf they may not be made the way you are used to making them but in one case that was an advantage the meatloaf recipe was far better than my standard version and the glaze was delicious do be aware of your oven 's peculiarities however and cover the top to keep the glaze from burning uncover just long enough to brown it would be best of course to use an oven thermometer and know your oven 's actual temperature since 350 in one oven may not be 350 in another those dials may be inaccurate but do n't make the mistake of thinking this is only for beginning cooks although it 'd be a perfect housewarming gift for the college graduate who is just setting up house there are plenty of new recipes especially a squash casserole which i am dying to try on my vegetarian friends after having tested it on my family and getting rave reviews in fact one of the nicest sections of this dvd was the vegetarian one each of those recipes looked delicious martha 's mother is featured in some of the segments and that was a pleasant surprise she and martha chat as they cook and the whole atmosphere is nice and casual no matter what you may think of martha stewart this dvd is a quality production with tons of useful info the dvd can also be inserted in a computer to get a list of menus and other features ||| 1
often overlooked robert altman 's 'the long goodbye ' is arguably one of the films exemplifying the and although far less dark ranks alongside antonioni 's 'the passenger ' propelling marlowe into the opulent 'promise ' of the west coast usa altman allows the story to unfold around a classic murder mystery story and the stunning cast help to create an atmosphere of parochial ' that can subsequently be seen in the works of david lynch tarrantino and more recently the 'sopranos ' the late great sterling hayden gives an unforgetable bullying volatile king performance as the ageing impotent alcoholic writer and mark rydell 's 'dangerous ' violent character anticipates that which martin scorsese and joe pesci create latterly in moreover there 's an uncredited cameo appearance of a moustachioed arnold schwarzenneger as a 'heavy ' however its elliiot 's gould 's brilliant oscar deserving performance as philip marlowe that helps to seal this film 's status into the canon of great films gould creates a sharp amiable detective whose ' livestyle allow him the freedom to give his own chandleresque dialogue 'it 's alright by me ' whilst interacting with a diverse range of characters within the narrative with respect to this there 's the continual variation of the haunting melody 'the long goodbye ' that is throughout the film thus floating the narrative structure within changing and moving events and themes yet anchoring it to the overall thread of the story itself altman 's direction is that of a genius at work the of the oceanic tug and wash of the tide as seen through the windows of the seductive though manipulative eilleen wade 's windows nina van pallandt together with slightly surreal and erotic appartment setting of marlowe 's flat make this film unforgetable there 's also the tension associated with the 'journeys ' to mexico a theme used in more recent great films including 'lone star ' 'traffic ' and 'the three burials of melquiades estrada ' who can deny the impact of the opening 'cat ' scene and the final 'chapter ' of the film set within the avenue of trees the ' figure of eileen wade heading in the opposite direction to marlowe who ironically celebrates his parochial sense of closure by playing the minature harmonica if ever a film rated as a ' for special merit and sheer enjoyment then this is one of the elite few deserving of such an award ! i urge you to watch or this film and savour a work of pure genius as a commentator and fan of such a seminal film i can only hope that robert altman elliot gould can provide a criterion edition dvd ||| 1
i could watch this over and over again ! it 's so funny ! the person who dissed women 's manly handshakes is a sexist ! but anyway i would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch ! definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too one viewing per 5 months do n't force it on them is my advice ! ! rock o ||| 1

what 's so 'ugly ' about this movie because it depicts the truth to all you parents out there this is exactly what teenagers do on a daily basis i know because i was once a teenager too and this movie hits the mark this is what happens when parent 's do n't have a solid relationship with their kids this movie is not ugly its just the straight up truth which most people do n't like to recognize it 's up to us as parents to guide our children in the right direction so this type of behavior can be minimized ||| 1

when i sat down to watch a movie called three woman with the knowledge that one of the three woman is shelley duvall my first reaction was that i would be better off drinking a nice tall glass of toilet water but that reaction was short lived it is rare for me to enjoy a movie that i was determined to hate from the first second but this movie forced me to pull a 180. the ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go it is a trance like movie i found that i could n't stop from watching yet i didnt know why i was watching very bizzare and very mezmerizing not a movie that will be enjoyed over and over however ||| 1
was meticulously planned out by our government if people do not believe me go read and study that day like it was your babay and you 'll find the truth i was a bit skeptical at first as well now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in this is n't the united states of america this is the beginning of a new world order do n't believe me we 'll probably never know because we 'll be spoonfed our news on the war in iraq by the corporate media that controls and censors what we see and do n't see ! do n't think so you along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in iraq by watching cnn censored news network or fauxnews it pains me that people still do n't realize that there is no fight for democracy in iraq its a fight for imperial ambitions we need iraq for oil and to set up a puppet government so it does n't scare israel our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of radical muslim fundamentalists '' no one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself instead of relying on experts '' who know '' what is going on i thought we were intelligent people us americans most of you ca n't even figure out wat the problem really is its our corrupt government ||| 1
i am a big fan of the book and thought the film version did it justice beautifully filmed excellent performances ||| 1
i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times due to my obsession and after watching it more than 25 times i 've come to appreciate it more great cast sam neil is my favorite richard attenborough is a little too cute and nice but i liked his white clothing the hat and the amber cane wayne knight was incredible as nedry the slob he 's as likeable as ever though somewhat the villain i always hate it when he dies jeff goldblum fit the description of ian malcom from crichton 's novel well crichton sparked my interest in chaos theory sometimes called the butterfly effect i am a firm believer in it and of course in the novel and film malcolm was right life finds a way '' in chaos theory the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions and random '' unpredictable events result from the normal '' because there is never a fixed set of outcomes the system is unpredictable because of its complexity hammond thought his system was without error that he was in complete control he believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female but he was wrong the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian dna that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur dna this dna gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce survive '' in a environment and it turned out that hammond was wrong about many other equations things are not as black and white as he thought and it is problematic to predict behavior of his animals love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet we watched the dna segment in a high school biology class i 've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated though i found hammond 's live speaking lines to be unrealistic was he really planning to be there for each tour the kids were kind of annoying i did n't notice this until i was a little older but lex i prefer to be called a hacker '' uses silicon graphics ' file system navigator to turn power back on in the park their logo is on the monitor if only unix were as popular as windows is now anyway the soundtrack was classic it was the first cd i bought back in the tonya harding skated to the theme at the 1994 olympics or some other competition i only liked her because of her excellent music choice ||| 1
greetings '' is an offbeat satire from a very young brian de palma starring an equally young robert de niro the vignettes focus on three friends first there is jon rubin de niro an aspiring filmmaker who has the idea of creating peep art '' this would consist of filming private moments '' and then letting people view them through tiny windows thereby the peeping tom experience more of this in de palma 's much better 1970 film hi mom ! '' however if you are expecting to see an amazing performance by one of the great actors of his generation in an early film you are going to be disappointed de niro comes off as overly mannered and a bit forced in his performance especially in comparison to his two his best moment is as he talks a woman through going to bed for his peep art she repeatedly forgets not to talk but he is a lot better two years later and had a decent career at least until he started making credit card commercials first there is lloyd clay gerrit graham a conspiracy nut so obsessed with the jfk assassination that a woman sleeping in his bed is just another opportunity to show that the paths indicated by the bullet holes do not match up unless jfk was shot while standing on his head lloyd shares his deep dark thoughts directly with the viewing audience as he argues vigorously to convince us he is right but sometimes he finds people in the real world to assault with his from the zapruder film that reduce the assassination to a rorschach test finally we have paul gerald shaw jonathan warden who would like to find the right girl his problem is that he has his induction physical and going to vietnam will really hurt his love life fortunately lloyd and jon are fully of ideas as to how paul can get the army to reject him everything from pretending to be gay and coming on to the sergeant lloyd 's idea to volunteering to shoot not only the vietcong but also any american troops of color jon 's brainstorm there is no real narrative thread here which is hardly a criticism because greetings '' is more of an ancestor of the groove tube '' saturday night live '' and second city tv '' in the history of contemporary sketch comedy with a heavy satirical bent the difference is that what de palma and his friends come up with in greetings '' is more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy but there is something compelling about its enthusiasm which makes us forgive the filmmaker and his actors when things go on a bit too long de palma has admitted to being influenced by godard and the french nouvelle vague '' cinema which inspired going out on the street and trying to improvise scenes only they did not have enough film to improvise so they ended up rehearsing most of the film to save money but even in this early work de palma is clearly into doing everything you can do with a movie camera greetings '' is a historical footnote in cinematic history inasmuch as it was the first film in the to be given an x '' rating later changed to r '' which is what it would qualify today because of some of the shots of nude women in terms of social history greetings '' represents some of the politics of the late it had been almost thirty years since i first saw greetings '' and hi mom ! '' back then they constituted part of my first real exposure to radical thought in terms of what was out there on the streets if you see just one of these films interested in how de palma was cutting his teeth as a director before he made his name with carrie '' and dressed to kill '' then hi mom ! '' is the choice the black in black baby '' bit is the must see segment of that satire but if you are interested in de palma 's career or comedy from the late then check them both out ||| 1
this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny but it did n't detract from the film glad i bought it ||| 1
this is a great family movie a fresh take on enchantment stories it 's rather in the style of nesbit 's books using contemporary references i find it far superior to many of disney 's usual works it 's enjoyable for adults and kids ||| 1
ella of frell anne hathaway is an unusual child as a baby a bumbling fairy godmother named lucinda vivica fox gave her the gift of obedience every time anyone gives her a direct command she must obey despite or maybe because of this gift '' ella grows to be a headstrong woman she goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres giants and elves current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only but ella campaigns for their equality she is also one of the few women in the realm who does n't swoon at the site of prince char hugh dancy when the two meet accidentally char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman trouble is brewing at home however ella 's stepsister hattie lucy punch has figured out ella 's secret now ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do so she leaves home and sets out to find lucinda to give the gift back i had missed seeing this movie in the theater and finally got a chance to watch it i missed a real treat the movie is funny from start to finish and i had a grin on my face the entire time while the story is a bit predictable it is n't super preachy the cast does an amazing job bring their characters to life the only drawback to the movie is the special effects while some worked well most of the time they were n't up to today 's standards while the main audience might be teen girls this is one adult male who loved it it 's sweet charming and entertaining what more could you want ||| 1

once again the saga of motoko kusanagi refuses to fall into the popular mold as manga as a pair of feature films and now a tv series it combines the classic crowd pleasers of the science fiction of a not too distant time a topnotch group of secret agents and a beautiful woman with a story line that is n't fraid to stop and contemplate the complicated world where the line between mechanical and human program and soul get crossed every day what you will see for most of these last few episodes is the dismantling of section 9 when their efforts to get to the bottom of the secretary general 's plot result in danger to the nations politicians this invites retaliation and everyone goes undercover and eventually fall into the governments hands all the laughing man 's efforts seem to come to naught and theire is every sign that this series is about to have a very nourish ending well all i 'll tell you is that the ending is worth all the trauma of getting there these three episodes really focus on the characters of the section 9 team in unexpected fashion and even the tachikoma 's make a reappearance this has been a contemplative series first the ethical questions raised by the laughing man and human cyberization then the even more difficult issues of what life is or can be in these episodes kusanagi reveals a personal philosophy which is both chilling and evocative of the samurai code she is a modern tomoe gozen unendingly loyal to arimaki and fiercely defiant in battle this has been a series with considerable depth that echoes but never slavishly imitates the work that has gone before a fine piece of work from both an artistic and an entertainment point of view ||| 1
i like pretty much all of annie leibovitz 's photography and if you have noticed her work on magazine stands you 'll probably enjoy the book too ||| 1

ok sue me i love this piece of cheese from the 70 's a remake of sorts of the last man on earth heston is a doctor who used a expermental sereum on himself after a bio war has wiped out most of the world the people who are left are albinos who ca n't get out in the sun vampires as they were in the book and they want heston to die for his crimes he is free of the germ and was an army doctor so they blame him for the end of the world heston spends his days tracking them and killing them and his nights whole up fighting off the mutants this was a staple of late night and for some reason the sunday afternoon movie you can tell in the stunts that it 's not heston and some of the speachs are well corny but the movie even with it 's down beat story is fun and can be scary for younger kids still i would be very careful about letting young ones see it as it has some nude scenes in it the widescreen transfer is very good as is the sound and the extras are small but very nice ||| 1

i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation the cover appealled to me for these reasons and i admit i was not at all disappointed in the movie the scenery was indeed spectacular the underwater scenes were clear crisp and just what the doctor ordered even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful ok enough of the shallow stuff the movie was indeed much like the 70 's flick the deep '' which i enjoyed back then as well the characters of jared and sam were pretty believable poor honest and happy folks most of us would love to really be this happy let 's face it ! the introduction of bryce played by scott caan really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers twists etc overall the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives would i want to deal with tiger sharks no but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring job every day ||| 1
this film is the best film that disney has in it 's collection ! every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life i really like all the extras on the disc as well i like seeing how the film was created looking at deleted scenes learning about the history of real pirates and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of walt disney himself ||| 1

in a nutshell underrated undervalued underexposed excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event ! it is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the harrison ford and liam neeson are ideally suited as soviet naval captains and as believable as their rebuilt authentic ! kathryn bigelow who directed and produced the film did an incredible job which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the dvd bottom line this new kind of sub film is a part of history if you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best if you enjoy thrillers this film delivers enough tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the and in anyone ||| 1
i 've seen the pilates infomercials for a while now but have been intimidated by the seemingly impossible movements when i found this inexpensive for dummies '' dvd i decided to give it a try what a workout ! i consider myself to be in moderately good shape and this workout can definitely be felt ! within the first couple of days i immediately noticed a change in my posture and a good burn in my abs hips and thighs i highly recommend this as both a great workout and a wonderful intro to pilates ||| 1

newman redford robert shaw as the bad guy twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so how can anyone not like the sting '' when i saw it on the big screen upon its first release i did not think it deserved the oscar as best film of its year although i enjoyed it now decades later and after having seen it perhaps 20 times at least in pieces i think it one of the best achievements in in its century it has style and a consistent sensibility and logic and on first viewing it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top i ca n't imagine that anyone over 30 has n't seen it yet but if that 's you fix it as soon as possible it is a primer in how to write direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience newman 's drunken on the train with shaw is absolutely classic ||| 1
hector elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill aside from his superlative work as a doctor on chicago hope '' he has been often cast as a sideman in films the trusted aide the sympathetic boss but often in supporting roles in tortilla soup '' he takes the leading role in a remake of ang lee 's eat drink man woman '' he plays martin naranjo a mexican chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist the movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared then eaten that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen martin is has lost much of his sense of taste which he thinks is a cruel irony but his cuban partner reminds him that beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago elizabeth pena is leticia the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple grace '' into jacqueline obradors is the saucy carmen who was encouraged to get her mba by martin but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion as her father did with his wondrous cooking tamara mello is the youngest maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to find herself '' constance marie is family friend yolando who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who martin dotes on raquel welch is yolando 's mother hortensia who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished martin the film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions at the beginning of the film all of the characters are single by the end they 've all been paired off in one manner or another some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others raquel welch is a bit of a distraction in the film at age 61 she has a beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25. in a film full of attractive performers she does n't look her age '' enough to blend into the story she plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester the movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and i would recommend it if only to watch hector elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen ||| 1
it is the ultima of cgi video game movies i must buy for final fantasy addicts ||| 1
if you love john waters then you 're already right there with me i would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie grease but is a more film i love rooting for the drapes and the idea that the squares can become drapes which thematically seems to be a waterian theme that we can all get along if we have sex with each other which is probably true john oh yeah and johnny depp is young here and cool and i think you will enjoy seeing both ricki lake and tracy lords and willem dafoe as well i know i did ||| 1
although subtitled grazia 's island grazia is the lead role magnificently realized by valeria golino respiro '' could have well been called scenes from rural sicilian life '' as the scenography cinematography and imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line respiro 's locale is lampedusa a tiny island far off the west coast of sicily about the same latitude as malta this place is about as remote as it gets tunisia is closer than palermo it can be safe to say that italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades this is italy of de sica and mascagni not fellini and prada the men go out to sea the children play women pack fish old crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky throughout this film you would probably ask yourself is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited '' it 's a fairly typical story the type that a few great and many many average italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations life in the sun drenched rural ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds how long since cinema paradiso '' what i like most about the movie besides the appealing scenery was the interrelations of the characters the humor petty gossips the impromptu emotional outbursts the displays of maternal and filial affection the two boys are tremendous the older pasquale francesco casisa is the more mature of the two the younger filippo filippo pucillo has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings often without sense his rant against the busybody women is a treasure as is his protectiveness of his sister from the the boy embodies an epic italianate inflammability far beyond his years while viewing this i thought the son 's affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times they do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village after seeing this film i have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar the differences are in the languages but the feelings are same i enjoyed this film so much i might see it a couple of times ||| 1
respiro is one of those italian treasures of a film this time written and directed by the insightful emanuele crialese that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story respiro mixes the italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by fellini lampedusa is a mediterranean island between sicily and tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of italy to be a return to the native the population is all involved in fishing on this picturesque island lives grazia the beautiful and talented valeria golina who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality she lives happily with her fisherman husband pietro and her children teenage marinella veronica d'agostini pasquale frncesco casisa a very fine little actor ! and filippo filippo pucillo the boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother 's wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace when grazia 's actions come under scrutiny by pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother muzzi loffredo who occasionally gives grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests grazia needs psychiatric help in milan grazia runs away to hide in a grotto her whereabouts are known only to pasquale the little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of grazia only to discover on st bartolo 's day that grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean how this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of respiro suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away ! this little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean of any film you 'll see the music by john surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric the way director crialese captures the behavior of the youngsters ' games and the philosophy of the villagers is utterly magical this is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society respiro is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to eden in italian with english subtitles grady harp november 200 ||| 1
i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies though i think the lost world '' is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies monster movies or horror movies should own all three i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two you will definitely like the third movie ||| 1
now it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004. a relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them bob roberts a son of a hippy couple rebels against that world view and uses music as a means of spreading conservative propaganda marketing hate and intolerance in the flag this movie frighteningly shows in fiction what is being done in reality today i think bob roberts will be a movie that historians will study 200 years ago and see it relevant for discussion of the united states around the turn of the millenium ||| 1
if you are not familiar with research this nice approach to a scientist 's work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies besides this very interesting and moving film with high level and homogeneous performances will show the closest it can the early facts about such a terrible disease i strongly recommend it i have seen it with my 16 year old son but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age a bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience ||| 1
i 'll make this short and sweet i used to work in spin i did advance which is creating media events for politicians in other words for a time i was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information i 'll let others speak to the eerie connections to orwell 's foresight i 'll let others write about how effectively the film makers make the case that which is represented in this piece is true the observations are astute the prognosis is grim i wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who clings to the belief in the ideas of the founding fathers buy it watch it watch it again share it with friends ||| 1
watch this and be inspired by the awesome herbie hancock the recording sessions are great the music and the movie flow along like a terrific jazz solo riffing on all kinds of themes but herbie brings it together into a whole just watching him play on the piano is a treat if you 're not that familiar with this living jazz legend check this out and you 'll admire both the man and his music ||| 1
your milage may vary but i found this movie intense and extremely provocative there is little danger of giving away the plot it is not particularly complex three stupid arrogant american teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from finland to the former ussr which at the time was very much the ussr and a very bad place for americans they make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate so far so good but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the russians who mistake them for spies some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving that i 'll keep a secret for ya i can promise you one thing if you are american after seeing this you 'll salute the flag think real hard before traveling overseas and i 'll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border ||| 1
bruce almighty is a great movie it about a newsreporter bruce nolan jim carrey that has a bad day a work gets fired and thinks that god is punishing him so god morgan freedman meets him at a warehouse and tell bruce that he can have all his powers then bruce has fun with the god powers gets his job back but sometimes its hard to be god you 'll have to watch the rest of the movie to find the rest out SMILE their are some great parts in the movie like when he gets a monkey to crawl out of a guys butt when he gets prayers it saids you got prayers '' instead of you got mail '' overall the story was pretty good and funny if you want to have some good laughs and giggles watch this and some scenes are not appropriate with children hehe though it is rating ||| 1
here is the reason why somebody like bruce can not be a god simply because the world would suck ! ! ! and his life too it 's a very good movie it shows that people ca n't always have what they want very interesting and unpredictable plot hilarious ||| 1

this 2 disc set is packaged in a very nicely made large metal box with room for the other volumes in the series if you feel the need to remove them from the original cardboard packaging you 'll lose your otaku status if you do the box is well adorned with imagery from the series and is a very good idea and generous from bandai considering that we 'd have bought a normal cardboard box with joy thanks bandai appreciated ||| 1
in some of fred astaire 's movies there 's only one excellent reason to watch and that 's to watch fred astaire in you were never lovelier there are three other excellent reasons rita hayworth jerome kern johnny mercer the four of them have concocted a romantic and funny south american fable that features some great dancing by both astaire and hayworth and some memorable songs by kern and mercer eduardo acuna adolphe menjou a wealthy buenos aires businessman has four beautiful daughters and in the acuna family they must marry in age order the eldest fulfills her responsibilities and the two youngest have beaus they 're now anxious to share vows with but the second eldest maria rita hayworth is in no hurry she wants romance and charm and the men she meets are just panting boys then she sees robert davis fred astaire a very charming dancer singing dearly beloved at her elder sister 's wedding he tries to chat her up she stares him down then the plot intervenes before long she knows what she wants robert knows what he wants eduardo acuna knows what he does n't want a dancer in the family from then on it 's songs dances romance and misunderstandings which moves into songs dances and romance the plot feels sluggish at times and there 's way too much xavier cugat and his orchestra but astaire and hayworth are at their peak kern has written some memorable melodies and few could top mercer at lyric writing none in hollywood hayworth not only was a gorgeous creature she was a gifted dancer many think she was the best astaire worked with technically she not only handled the steps astaire created she did so without a hint of effort after you 've watched the dances a couple of times go back and watch again but this time concentrate on her face and her hand and arm action she gives every indication of being utterly relaxed and enjoying herself even in the fast tap routines she seems naturally to find the most graceful attitude for an extended arm a turn of her head a raised hand she may not be quite as good as astaire but she 's good enough among the routines are the audition dance robert shows up at acuna 's office and demands a chance to show his stuff as a dancer from there astaire takes off on a fast tap routine that takes him all over the floor onto acuna 's desk the sofa and chairs he works into the dance a cane a rug the drapes and acuna 's head i 'm old fashioned this is probably the best romantic wooing dance astaire did it 's all fluid motion and spontaneous recognition danced on the elegant polished outdoor landing of acuna 's mansion rita hayworth is a vision and matches him step for step we move from maria declaring with humor and assurance that robert 's the man for her to robert 's protestation that he 's just a guy from omaha nebraska to the dance that brings them closer and closer together until we know through the dance that a love match has just happened the funny exit through the doors and back into the bumping into each other each giving way bumping again and then going in together arm in arm hits just the right note the dance works so well in part because kern and mercer came up with a classic i 'm old fashioned i love the moonlight i love the old fashioned things the sound of rain upon a window pane the starry song that april sings this year 's fancies are passing fancies but sighing sighs holding hands these my heart understands i 'm old fashioned but i do n't mind it that 's how i want to be as long as you agree to stay old fashioned with me the shorty george this fast tap routine starts out with maria visiting robert at a rehearsal he sings the shorty george and she takes a couple of lines he looks surprised that she knows the song he starts to dance and invites her to join him hayworth stays right with astaire and looks like she 's having the time of her life you were never lovelier robert declares his feelings for maria but more misunderstandings occur finally everything is resolved robert shakes off some knight 's armor he was wearing there is sort of a reason and appears below maria 's bedroom window in black tie she rushes down and off they go dancing while all the members of the acuna family look on approvingly and the johnny mercer lyrics and jerome kern music brings us to the happy end you were never lovelier you were never so fair dreams were never lovelier pardon me if i stare down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face i can only say they chose the proper place you were never lovelier and to coin a new phrase i was never luckier in my palmiest days make a note and you can quote me honor bright you were never lovelier than you are tonight ||| 1
city by the sea is a movie that is propelled by its rich performances particularly those of robert deniro and frances mcdormand both oscar winners they infuse their characters with such humanity and imperfection they make this movie much better than it would have been in other hands james franco although obviously in '' to his performance comes across attempting to repeat his emmy award winning role as james dean the mannerisms the false bravado the hurt and pinched face are trademarks of the late dean and franco seems to enjoy using them again william forsythe approaches a caricature of his role but it 's still spinetingling enough to make your skin crawl anson mount as the moralistic cop dave simond gives a strong understated performance showing that all cops are n't bad george dzundza as deniro 's partner is also good as is linda emon as his wife in a very touching and sad scene where deniro confronts her after dzunda 's death at the hands of deniro 's son the movie is to be commended for giving us characters with flaws and in understanding the way some relationships never fully materialize or heal the film has some marvelous cinematography of the old asbury park area and has an ending that while not totally satisfying is real a good movie ||| 1
rather than menace to society '' this movie should be titled the unfortunate victims of a racist society '' my heart bleeds for the counterparts of these young men caught up in the unending battle for survival in la and other such areas all around the country i understand that we all make choices but how many do these young men have it is a racist exclusionary society that has condemned them to their fate to die violently at the hands of their own brothers its sickening society is more of a menace to these young men than they are responsible for being a menace to society having said that the movie itself is excellent it 's gritty and real to the 'nth ' degree movies like this should be a huge wakeup call for the 'powers that be ' in this country but the reality is that the grave lessons it teaches will pass unnoticed ||| 1
i wanted to see a movie one evening and it really did n't matter what movie i just wanted to get out of the house and get to a theater i looked at the listings and decided to see in good company '' and i 'm certainly glad i did i found this movie to be very entertaining and very enjoyable to watch i thought this movie really showed a new edge to scarlett johansson as well in a way this movie was also an on todays ' corporate america and its ' all too often pitfalls nicely produced acted and directed ||| 1
eddie dies and goes to heaven where he learns his life has been meaningful to at least 5 people i enjoyed watching this movie and i feel it allows us to appreciate the little things done for others not making us feel guilty because we did not change the world with a bang ||| 1
this is one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it when it first came out and ten years later it 's still just as funny basic plot ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he 's alone on new year 's night anyone who 's had a bad on the job can relate to ted as he encounters the most 'unusual ' situations from the witches who need his 'secret ' ingredient to make their potion to a gangster 's bratty kids a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken hollywood people who want to make ted part of their hazardous and very gross bet i do n't want to give too much away but i will say that i will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever if you love a good dark comedy this is the movie for you ||| 1
this set is one of the better jurassic park sets each disk contains a lot of extras many of which are fun to watch fans of the trilogy that have yet to buy the dvds will find this set a great one to have jurassic park '' introduced us to digital dinosaurs and how fearsome they could be with modern computer technology this movie advanced horror and monster movies in a method similar to the way alien '' advanced science fiction movies jurassic park '' immediately became an audience favorite and the new standard by which special effects would be judged stephen spielberg effectively combined terror with special effects to keep people at the edge of their seats and in awe of creatures dinosaurs the lost world '' unfortunately did not measure up to jurassic park '' many of the characters were unbelievable and there were too many plot holes that were too readily visible to make the movie enjoyable from beginning to end while there were several parts of the movie that were there were at least as many parts where the actions of the characters were unrealistic the bumps in the actions of the characters just did not allow me to focus on the plot throughout another problem with this movie is that it focused too much on action and very little on the characters themselves thus the movie comes across as more of a cartoon than a horror movie jurassic park iii '' simplified the plot added new dinosaurs and allowed the characters to develop more than the lost world '' the short length of the movie forced the movie to be simpler than the previous movie and that simplicity makes for a good movie the best new dinosaur in this movie had to be the pteranodons though the spinosaur was great also the characters in this movie generally acted as i would expect them to and there were fewer outright acts of stupidity even the theft of a raptor egg was done in ignorance so while it was a convenient plot device you would expect something like that by someone with only minimal knowledge of dinosaurs i was very happy to see sam neill returning in the role of alan grant his character particularly is very believable enjoy ! ||| 1
i loved ben vereen in the show wanted the music for my ipod too very satisfie ||| 1
this show undoubtly is one of the greatest around i have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give american 's their own monty python show and they failed because their show is better than monty python their show is not better it is of equal and noteworthy standing monty python is history that will never been changed they have gone on to do many other creative things bob odenkirk is doing miller lite commercials and i hope he does something like david has with his new appearance in arrested development i can honestly say that this show is not better yet it is close to monty pythons flying circus both are great shows it is full of hillarious sketches and original ideas that is for sure and if you have n't yet go buy the other seasons and add to your growing comedy sets because you wo n't regret adding this ||| 1
hospitals are inherently spooky scenes of so much pain and death the very walls soaking up the agony through the years they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there the hospital in infection '' kansen '' is in particularly bad shape losing money unable to keep staff the doctors and nurses working there are and desperate into this unstable environment comes a strange patient with a black infectious rash slowly the rash spreads revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human 's body slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation but all is not as it seems even then i 'm impressed that even watching as much as i do infection '' still managed to creep me out it was unexpectedly good director masayuki ochiai knows the things in a hospital that can make you cringe and he uses them to their fullest extent he also keeps you guessing as to exactly what kind of horror movie this is is it about a devastating biological infection are those ghosts is that a serial killer all of his images and slow revelations of the story keep making less and less sense disorientating you just when you think you have a handle on it until the final page is revealed and it all comes crashing home infection '' is n't quite a flick like ichi the killer '' but it definitely relies on visual shock for its scares while keeping a good atmosphere if anything it manages to combine the creepy mood of ghost films like ring '' while still delivering on gore one scene in particular had me going when you see the movie you will know what it was as part of the theater '' series and directer by a relatively who 's experience has mainly been doing horror tv shows i did n't have high expectations for this film i thought it would be a cheap job done to cash in on the current fad i was wrong it is quite a well made little horror flick not outstanding or groundbreaking but really excellent for what it is ||| 1

at ikiru 's opening i started to have real doubts about the film i had heard that this was kurosawa 's best and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down luckily that did n't happen the narrator of the film reminded me of criswell 's narrations to plan 9 from outer space the film seemed to say too much and show too little then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero watanabe at work something clicked the long duration of the shot and the narrator 's continued breakdown of the man 's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds and that we are powerless to silence it that floored me and for the rest of the film i remained by this humble yet miserable man takashi shimura gives one of the greatest performances i 've seen since raging bull here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world but he 's smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt the horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time there are points at which the film seems to drag on but never without purpose when he dies having finally given meaning to his existence his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity confusion and finally admiration the scene lags which makes us that much more insulted by their ignorance ||| 1
this is a great film that preceded the onset of the jlo '' out of sight '' is a great showcase for jennifer lopez 's talent as an actress it is a shame that she has n't been presented with more great roles like that of karen sisco in this film karen is a who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude she has a chance encounter with charming compulsive bank robber jack foley george clooney their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his kidnapping of sisco in her own car it is no surprise that sparks fly this does n't downplay the complexities of their encounter some of the greatest strong points of this film include the juxtaposition of flashbacks incorporating trick camera work and voice overs what 's more this film was shot in a very bare bones style we do n't get a sense of romance so much as a feeling of stark reality the colors are dark the dialogue between the characters is honest real and simply wonderful this film has a potential for mass appeal due to the fact that though it does get gritty and violent that does n't downplay its intelligence or originality violence is counterbalanced by genuinely funny scenes as well as more introspective glimpses at how the characters turned out as they did this is definitely a great date film ! ! ||| 1
this was one of the best movies of 1998 but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience when i try to think of superlatives to desribe it the one that keeps coming to mind is cool '' most of the coolness factor is owed to two things steven soderbergh 's steady directing and the chemistry between the actors especially george clooney and jennifer lopez back before we knew that clooney would go on to channel the same character in virtually all of his roles he defined suave in this movie and back before she was lopez was that in living color fly girl with the big ole butt trying to make a name for herself as a film actress here she gives the best performance of her career while all of the cast ving rhames dennis farina albert brooks and michael keaton and samuel jackson in cameos is solid after clooney and lopez the real star is don cheadle he is quite convincing as the prison boxer snoopy he oozes rage and steals every scene that he 's in plots based on books by elmore leonard tend to be above average but are mostly dependent upon the colorful characters he writes thanks to the talent of all involved this movie is one of the best ||| 1
i did n't think it would be that great and only saw it for joshua jackson but the plot twists were really good and i enjoyed it a lot and of course kate hudson whom i adore even though i did n't pay much attention to her in this one but yeah i really liked the end and this is where i first heard of norman reedus then i saw the boondock saints SMILE this is a good movie and is very underappreciated ||| 1

this dvd has wonderful workouts i think the flexibility of 10 min workouts to target certain areas is a fabulous idea it keeps me motivated to keep going the dvd does n't work as it should you should be able to pick 3 different workouts and it will play the ones you 've picked in order this does n't work so i just pick the ones i want to do one at a time and then i 'm able to workout the areas i want ||| 1

i first watched this performance on pbs great performances it is amazing i 'm very happy to finally find a complete version of the stage show on dvd rachel york does a performance in the leading role the rest of the cast is up to par there have been other reviews that say the music is dated or other such nonsense but do not pay heed to them premiered in 1948 the musical is based on the taming of the shrew shakespeare and the music and lyrics are done by cole porter sometimes referred to as his masterpiece which i agree with the production never drags or disappoints the lyrics are extremely witty a trademark of porter the music keeps you humming along for days ||| 1
this show is great the season was considered by critics but it is truely halarious see 'the ski lift ' for a classic curb episode ||| 1
happiness can be delicate in just one swoop it can stolen out from under you just when you least expect it the results can be often devastating some can never recover the family in the italian film the son 's room has found such happiness but when tragedy suddenly strikes they 're engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache grief is perhaps the most tangled of human emotions and the vagaries of sadness love and anger that comprise its essence are often very difficult to portray luckily director and actor nanni moretti avoids all the usual clichs in this delicately nuanced and subtly acted film the son 's room is indeed a moving and weighty depiction of one family 's attempts to heal after sudden death strikes them moretti stars as giovanni a successful psychiatrist with a busy practice treating the assorted neurotics of the northern italian coastal town he and his family call home giovanni is a and kindly man who has a sort of passive and submissive approach to living giovanni also has a lovely family he 's happily married to gorgeous book publisher paola laura morante and shares what he considers a close relationship with his teenaged daughter irene jasmine trinca and son andrea giuseppe sanfelice he presides over his wife and two children with a kind of flaccid authority enveloping them with the same deceptively passive doctoral concern with which he counsels his psychiatric patients he supports and heals less by what he says than by what he does n't say he quietly coaches andrea in soccer moves while encouraging irene to be more competitive at basketball perhaps it 's an ominous portent of what is to come but the film opens as andrea and his friends have been accused of stealing a valuable fossil from the school 's science department giovanni and paola are surprised to find they entertaining the idea that their son may in fact be guilty as charged however no one takes the incident that seriously if this is the only drama that affects giovanni 's serene life nothing prepares him for the sudden tragedy that occurs one sunny sunday afternoon called away from home by a desperate client giovanni cancels his plans to go jogging with andrea and it 's a fatal choice that haunts him for months to come the accident when it happens is so unexpected the loss giving rise to sorrow rage tenderness and the inexplicable feeling that hope is no longer possible the family emotionally fractured is unable to continue on plunged into unimaginable grief giovanni attempts to carry on with his life but bereft of his objectivity he finds he 's no longer able to function as an analyst the son 's room with it 's subtle acting and its pensive emotionally layered story remains a startling testament to the delicate nuances of grief and it 's as though moretti has invited the viewer to spy on a deeply personal event in the life of a very ordinary family like a fly on the wall we witness the sadness the regret the empty dinners and the overwhelming feeling of whether they could have done anything to stop the accident moretti whose eyes glitter with knowledge from within a bland bearded professorial face gives a wonderful performance as does the classy morente as the beautiful anguished paola while giovanni wanders dazed through a theme park numb to the grief paola fields a desire to talk about the absent child a savior for the family arrives in a letter addressed to the deceased and when the writer appears on the family 's doorstep she offers the grace note that reminds them of the means by which happiness eventually repairs itself and the unavoidable fact that life goes on there 's no catharsis here only a heartfelt exploration of what it means to grieve mike leonard august 05 ||| 1
this series is awesome and i am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over it speaks to the depths of the soul of a man having experienced intense pain though not in war i find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series this bonding is what men were meant to do not just in war but in our every day battles the sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional i recommend this for any group of buddies or even church groups ||| 1
very good acting and a fantastic script put this movie at the top of the list of must see movies of this decade you have to decide for yourself about the spiritual quality and message but i personally thought it was well done joaquin phoenix puts in his usual top notch performance ||| 1
not only does the movie signs offer a wonderfully different kind of tale but its characters are very likable and the story is about much more than aliens from another planet the story 's true question is this does everything just happen by chance or is god caring for his children in ways they simply can not understand signs is the story of hope lost faith put aside because of intense pain and grief and how one man 's relationship with god affects the lives of those around him we were amazed by how truly moving this film is as well as how humorous it can be and we were impressed with the acting of all the cast does everything just happen by chance or is god caring for his children in ways they simply can not understand ||| 1
this movie is obviously not for everyone it 's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour 's nope instead you get the muscle huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in this film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart soul and body of every other thing in existence in an world this film is a big orgy of questioning and who does n't like questioning this film in its own right is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films huckabees '' offers us an impressive cast with dustin hoffman lily tomlin jason schwartzman jude law mark wahlberg isabelle huppert one of my favorite international actress 's and naomi watts most notable performances by namely dustin hoffman as it 's nice to see him in an exceptional role he has n't really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997 's wag the dog '' it 's very nice to see hoffman play a great character as bernard the quirky husband half of the existential detectives also most notable is the performance of mark wahlberg as tommy corn another client of the detectives that befriends albert tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather rides a bike to the fire saying we 'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum '' mark wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably boogie nights '' and three kings '' however this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else the ensemble 's performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless the most credit to this movie goes to david russell russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story but the story is amazingly written the script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that ||| 1
she just keeps getting better and better i love this woman she makes us all look at ourselves and laugh over situations that are hurtful i personally will keep an open mind and try to copy some of her down to earth common sense a lot uf us have let go of for whatever reason way to go ||| 1
one thing about arrested development that i forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years what i found funny last year when i was watching the show is just as consistently funny now in fact now that i understand the style of humor better i think the show is even funnier now fox had something good cooking with arrested development it seems whenever a show does n't get the ratings a network wants a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings it very rarely works and sadly arrested development is another example of this i ca n't blame fox for pulling the plug after all they tried their hardest to promote the show i remember sunday nights watching the simpsons and during the commercials the people at fox really wanted viewers to tune in the writers of the show should be proud that fox tried very hard to keep it on the air it 's just unfortunate people did n't want to watch it i still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy arrested development would be around today as it stands 53 episodes are all we have of this great show honestly it 's not enough but will have to do do we really need anymore laugh track comedies are n't there more than enough of them on the air now most of these shows people wo n't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there 's so many most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same and they blend together one plainly obvious joke after another i 'm bored just thinking about it we 've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to arrested development is the right move in my opinion the times need to change people make a big deal about arrested development because there 's really nothing else like it on television that 's why the show deserves all the ratings it has received here on amazon people would n't be praising the show so much if there was n't a good reason for it trust me there 's a reason for all the positive reviews buy one of the dvd season sets pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave watch the show and experience the joy so many people are raving about ||| 1
this is a great dvd about cage matches it has a lot of violent matches on it and a lot of classic cage matches but the reason why i i am giving this 4 stars is because most of the matches on here are jips matches joined in progress it would have been better if all the matches were full but on disc 2 it has 7 full matches but that is still no enough matches this dvd is worth a buy but remeber only 7 matches are full ||| 1
i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years and i still ca n't make it all the way through the level 2 '' workouts this video is incredibly challenging but i like that i can do the level 1 '' workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts this is a great dvd ||| 1
i am absolutely in love with this movie it 's a real documentary not a mocumentary but it is hilarious the special features on the dvd are n't amazing but the movie itself is absolutely wonderful ||| 1
in the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from andy griffith in 1957 's a face in the crowd '' master director elia kazan gets similarly stellar results from natalie wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920 's kansas in the same year as her maria in west side story '' she has never been more affecting then she is here as deanie loomis the local butcher 's daughter deeply in love with bud stamper the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero they are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents the ruling moral code restricts deanie more than bud who ends up cavorting with a girl named juanita the indiscretion overwhelms deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state a few years later with their lives on divergent paths they meet again to come to terms with each other while the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to kazan 's sure hand and william inge 's screenplay his first directly for the screen it 's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue otherwise there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955 's picnic '' based on inge 's successful broadway play at her most beautiful wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned as the bud warren beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes deanie 's powerful fixation completely understandable there are several standout performances among the supporting cast with audrey christie as deanie 's unsympathetic mother pat hingle in blowhard mode as bud 's father and zohra lampert as angie the waitress bud meets at yale the classic wordsworth poem from which the film 's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie and i still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time i see this movie the 2001 dvd unfortunately has no extras ||| 1

whats not to like about ct i own this dvd and the audio double cd thats me thats all you 'll need what really makes it worth it is the commentary '' a fabulous and totally hillarious walk thru of all the songs on the dvd i can think of no other band that has the ability to laugh at themselves like these guys do that humor along with superior musicianship makes them as well as this dvd a must have ! ||| 1
the boys take the stage on their hometown for a silver '' anniversary concert and pull out all the stops guest stars abound along with a host of other musicians add to the celebration and the crowd was indeed rabid all the songs are represented here that ct fans expect and are delivered with verve all band members are represented here and even former bassist jon brandt joins in for his album cuts the dvd offers up a nice selection of extras including rick nielson hamming it up for the camera off stage and on stage of course cheap trick wails and all is right in the world now for the negatives from this release sound is just okay after some heavy eq work i was able to get a very good sound from my sony 5.1 system but camera work is indeed lacking cameras used for long shots had badly overexposed pictures much of the time and many of the handheld shots were in wrong position but that may have been an editing problem all in all i give the performance and production 3 stars a very generous ||| 1
this 1954 musical release is just too fun to pass up adam howard keel oh my god what a voice needs a wife and zeros in on milly jane powell to drag back to his oregon territory farm and six unruly brothers the tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge milly makes believers out of them the brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town whoops they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets for winter the songs are lovely the story charming but it 's the dance choreography that brings me back again and again there are two numbers in particular which showcase the brothers ' dance skills and they are outstanding julie newmar of catwoman fame is one of the kidnapped cuties they stick her in the back or whisk her out completely for the more involved dance routines but who cares it 's julie newmar ||| 1
you know you have a hit on your hands when even your boys want to sit and watch this wonderful video over and over again ! i pass them walking around the house humming the music and even asking for art materials to try some of the things they have seen in the video best educational video i have seen for motivating the creative side of children and it has motivated me to buy other brainy baby videos try wo n't be dissapointed ! ||| 1
this movie may not be for everyone but to me it 's highly memorable possible spoiler alert this is n't your ordinary travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about '' back to the future although granted it was better made and more entertaining butterfly effect is really about in alphabetical order acceptance chance charity choice grownup love hope identity opportunity regret and sacrifice some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting here are my thoughts kutcher to me always seemed an innocent caring small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as and that 's why i was n't surprised to see him pull off this role amy smart was good mostly but glaringly at times granted she had to show more range the the other actors ||| 1
this definitely is one of the best movies to own ! ! if you have n't seen it yet you should if you 've seen the movie blood in blood out '' then you should definitely see this one if you have n't seen either one then i reccommend you buying them both as a combo pack or separately if you want to save i do n't know which one i love more out of the two because i know i 've watched each movie more then 30 times both movies are pretty similar to each other but blood in blood out '' kinda focuses on the 3 brothers and the paths each of them takes where as american me '' focuses on the paths of the main characters in this movie like santana puppet lil ' puppet etc but not only does it show their lifestyles but it also focuses on how its having an effect on their families and how their families feel about the life that their kids are leading american me '' i think involves more of the family in this picture and culture la raza then blood in blood out '' does it also shows its origin like the pachuco 's zoot suit 's zoot suit riots this movie is pretty close to 5 stars in my book to me i think it definitely is star better then blood in blood out '' becuase this one seems to have alot more of a story line to it and more characters its focusing on both in and outside the prison if you 're not sure about owning it rent it first but i can pretty much guarantee that you 'll eventually end up owning it ||| 1
an intriging suspense film with a shocking ending the clues are obvious throughout the film but the viewer is nevertheless surprised and possibily amazed alan rickman shines as david weinburg the social climbing husband his performance shows his versality as an actor for viewers who like suspense dark harbor is a must ||| 1
this excellent dvd gives us a remarkable version of martin scorsese 's film it has been color corrected by scorsese himself and remastered for superior sound quality the concert on thanksgiving day in 1976 was the final concert of the band with its original lineup numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion the band were clearly at the top of their game that night despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them classic songs like up on cripple creek '' stage fright '' and they night they drove old dixie down '' are given excellent rendtions the guest stars seem to be having a good time with backing by the band themselves ronnie hawkins does an outstanding who do you love '' john does his classic such a night '' joni mitchell performs her underrated coyote '' a ' van morrison rocks the house with caravan '' and blues legend muddy waters does a spectacular mannish boy '' in a making of '' featurette scorsese says waters ' perforance of this song was almost not filmed because most of the cameras ran out of film fortunately one cameraman caught the whole song so we can have this excellent performance neil young eric clapton and bob dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of the band the dvd also incudes two commentaries one features scorsese and robbie robertson the other features levon helm garth hudson and guests stars hawkins and mavis staples they all have good stories to tell and serve to enhance the film quite well a previously unseen jam and an eight page booklet written by robertson round out the dvd i highly reccomend this dvd to this classic film 's many fans ||| 1
welcome to the lower east side where the apartments of the abut the tenements on the riverside here joel mccrea a poor architect is infatuated with rich girl wendy barrie while poor girl sylvia sidney pines for him all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets into the scene strides humphrey bogart as a wanted killer coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the dead end kids in what would be the first of many screen appearances of which sidney 's brother is the leader the film is based on a play and boy can you tell the studio set is deeply obvious as such and the structure is too carefully symmetrical the social symbolism is subtle as a sledgehammer and the script is too caught up with being worthy bogart 's performance is a striking one however and his character stands out as fully realized when compared to the walking social messages incarnated by sidney and mccrea the dead end kids also known as the east side kids the bowery boys and the little tough guys would show again the following year in angels with dirty faces and viewing the two films together is instructive showing among other things the difference between mgm 's gloss which sat uneasily on a gangster story and warner 's far more convincing grit the mono track is in good shape the print is in pretty good shape but there 's no hiding the fact that this is a film from 1937. the trailer is here and nothing else the menu is basic once celebrated with oscar nominations this film now seems rather silly compared to the warner gangster films of the same period but it has a definite historical value and certainly deserves its release ||| 1
this continuation of the anne series on screen is very well done and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did the only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers what it really does is just focus on a few key incidents and drastically truncates anne 's college and teaching experiences morgan harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of roy gardner sophy sinclair old gibson and pauline and elizabeth this installment ends with anne and gilbert becoming engaged i highly recommend it just do n't expect the same level of detail as anne of green gables '' provided ||| 1

brilliant is an often overworked phrase but in the case of starring mel gibson the word can not be used enough for brevity 's sake i will save zeffirelli 's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing this review is for chris devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult shakespeare script devore somehow makes it better were he in london late 1500 's he would have been a collaborator making will 's work the pearl it is today my only plea is that at some date we will get to see gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared this may have been glenn close 's best work this is not a complaint but rather a sign that anyting else she may have or has done can not be any better than this wonderful small role ophelia close has an important commentary that must be heard in order for the play to work will was no fool and it needs a close to do it alan bates has been a staple of english theatre and screen and has delivered many fine parts such as gabriel oaks in from the madding 1967 as claudius the regicide and brother of hamlet senior bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble except for that one small cancer that flaw in his character very clintonian and very believable i have wanted to kick ian holm 's ever since ash hurt ripley in 1979. i have to keep reminding myself that he really is that believable and that i really do n't hate him it 's the character he has created so well his body of work is repleat with characters of such believability that you forget his name ian holm until he does it again the next time in the next movie if films were strictly hasidic holm 's version of polonius would be kosher there is not one piece of ham in his entire performance it is worth the purchase of the dvd just to see him act everyone is good in the movie and there is not time to talk about all of them but a note to those whose noses are airbourne and wo n't tolerate anyone but olivier as hamlet there are several uneven performances in his excellent movie there are no uneven performances in this piece finally we come to the mad prince of denmark it is most astonishing that i watched this epic again after mel 's dark night of the troll thrashing about in complete insanity arguably brought on by hard likker frustration and stupidity yet with all said gibson is the essential hamlet you will find no other actor who delivers the goods the way the cruiser from the boozer does you know this is true not just by watching the exquisite performance on the dvd but by gibson 's own marvelling at what was accomplished not because of some actor 's raison d'etre but rather by the actor 's very ability to understand that he is dealing with things that go beyond the ken of normal humans is hamlet crazy or crazy like a fox and when is he crazy we get to hear mel say in the devastating interview he made for the dvd release many years gone by so enough from me if you want to see the best hamlet ever buy this dvd and feast dick anderso ||| 1
harvey milk was the elected supervisor of district 6 in san francisco when he was murdered along with mayor george moscone on november 27 1978 by fellow supervisor dan white who later claimed the infamous twinkie defense '' the film the times of harvey milk '' firmly places the murder of milk a gay politician into the politically significant context of the times the crime the verdict and the sentence served were all shocking this film tells the story behind the headlines milk was a stockbroker on the east coast when he decided to pull up roots and head for san francisco he opened a camera shop on castro street and quickly earned the name of mayor of castro street '' for his enthusiastic community involvement his interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office but when the city 's elections ran by district rather than citywide milk became the newly elected supervisor for the sixth district milk 's enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall the film includes photographs newsreel footage and many interviews with those who crossed milk 's path in a professional or personal capacity milk was passionate about public transportation rent control and the rights of seniors and gays white on the other hand found san francisco 's gay day obscene '' eerily there are several photos of milk that also include his killer clean cut and family man supervisor dan white the film explores the flavour of the times san francisco was becoming a gay mecca and there were some people who could n't adjust to that fact senator john briggs who called san francisco the moral garbage dump of the nation '' was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired milk fought this ballot tooth and nail and it failed the film the times of harvey milk '' includes two discs one disc contains the film and the other disc is packed with extra features including coverage of the film 's premiere in castro street a dan white update and anniversary events of the crime director 's commentary the academy awards 1985 and a photo gallery for those of us who remember the headlines the times of harvey milk '' is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time displacedhuma ||| 1
the danny boyle directed trainspotting '' was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of scottish heroin addicted losers while the film garnered accolades i found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted ewan mcgregor playing mark renton and his crew which included full monty '' star robert carlyle as violent psycho begbie swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high congregating in a filthy deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high as a group they 're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix mcgregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories in a humorous scene cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories he then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them mcgregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations escaping to london and working as a realtor his buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life mcgregor and carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true big drug deal they manage to complete the deal for pounds which mcgregor decides to steal he intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew fat chance ||| 1

an excellent movie about a smart conman who eventually ends up rendering his skills to the fbi the movie is not just about this but a lot of subtle things like the relationships between abagnale and his dad some of the scences were very well picturized silent mutual giggle which abagnale leonardo and his dad exchange as they walk out from the school principal 's office tom hanks enquires with abagnale 's dad if he know where leonardo is his dad replies that 'if you had son you will know that it is your son whom you love more than anything else' overall it is one of the best movies i have seen everything in this movie deserves 5 stars ||| 1
this dvd is explaining things better than the previous version where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc some of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained the on water meditated upon by the japanese monk was especially awesome they have tried their best to explain stuff that cant be easily explained by the western modern science ofcourse ends in letting you ponder have left most of it there there after one has to go into religion and spirituality particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the sanathana dharma '' teachings ||| 1
i can not recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie which is my favourite from the 1980 's by far the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in big business '' that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood 's golden age a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely does n't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in big business '' it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york 's business world the story begins in a flash back when wealthy new yorkers hunt and binky shelton are passing through rural backwater jupitor hollow when binky goes into labour at the same time locals garth and iona ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of sadie and rose but are also mixed up we move forward forty years to where sadie shelton is the corporate head of moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of holomade the local industry in jupitor hollow getting wind of their plans the militant jupitor hollow resident rose ratliff decides to go fight these pinstriped trouser snakes '' on their own territory and sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring jupitor hollow through a mix up they end up staying in the plaza hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as sinks in the living room '' and soaps in the shapes of swans '' ! complication piles on top of complication as sadie shelton 's ex husband michael barry primus ca n't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural sadie for his hard nosed wife and jay marshall michael gross ca n't for the life of him understand why rose ratliff is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure rose shelton all comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two sadie 's are really the city sheltons while the two rose 's are really the twins meant to be in jupitor hollow the fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when sadie shelton is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to sadie ratliff to put all her watching of her idol alexis carrington in dynasty '' to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing jupitor hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins on the classic 1960 's comedy series the patty duke show '' i dont think i 've ever seen bette midler in finer form than in big business '' her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails sadie shelton who 's all hostile takeovers '' to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin sadie ratliff who only wants to be able to say keep the change ! '' is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter her classic mirror sequence with her twin '' is a total riot and her statement that this whole thing has got ufo written all over it ! will have you breaking up with laughter equally lily tomlin as both country activist rose ratcliff i 'm gon na go kick some snooty new york ass ! and as rose shelton the awkward out of place city girl i hate shopping and i hate new york in june ! is also top rate her rejection of jay 's engagement ring as a supposed bribe '' and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a great big belly scraping pile of cow plop ! is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene i never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening i have of this movie of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at new york 's plaza hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk 's joe grifasi continual mixing up of sadie which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined and especially fabio alberici 's michele placido total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with one minute they are corporate killers the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone ! the hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women one from the country and the other from the city seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff it is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both bette midler and lily tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first classics like im gon na dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease ! '' oh my god it 's so cosmopolitan '' oh sure its full of crowds smog sex fiends and white slavers it 's a pistol i 've got about as much use for it new york as a toad has for spit pearls ! computer chips they 've got their ways ! and have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more it is a real pity that big business '' so far has marked the only time that bette midler and lily tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle this film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages i 've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as i am ! so i 'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you have n't already you wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends in bette midler and lily tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in big business '' enjoy ! ||| 1
warning ! this is not for children seeing death real destruction and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on is not for the young with that being said this is the real deal what you probably did n't see on the nightly news great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of new york city that fateful day if you never want to forget what happened the day that changed america you must have this dvd ||| 1
this documentary gives a brief introduction to which if you did n't know already is the main arab language newschannel it is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it 's willingness to go where other and controlled arab networks wo n't tread in this sense it is more than a mere arab cnn in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media the filmmakers here interview personel as well as some american journalists and the american official which liases with for centcom the american central command in the present irak war which happens to be 30 miles from al jazeera headquarters it covers the timeline from just before the war to just after bush anounced main millitary operations to be over by striving to be neutral the documentary allows you to see how see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world they are very disappointed in the united states but adhere strongly to its values also interesting is how being on the arab side '' gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values like when they are angered by pentagon protests at their having showed images of us prisoners when western media routinely show iraki pows an unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be the american liaison does n't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source and as if that were n't enough he is barely articulate in english and clearly does n't know anything about the local context and history another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials but does n't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists irritating the very people they are trying to win over all in all it 's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds it gets four stars rather than five because of it 's sometimes amateurish handling of flow which makes it at times a bit unfocused ||| 1
i found this dvd to be well produced and engaging to go along with the powerful content fantastic loads of deleted scenes that are very worth watching ||| 1

i woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of fellini satyricon someone is mortally wounded the blonde guy and lies there dying watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired gitone and some dancing leaping black guy i think i 've seen it probably 9 times it always was a favorite when i was a teen and older but i have n't seen it for years but it was so visually entrancing and so truly that is made from that standpoint which movies seldom are or can be ! i just remember the wonderul images a boat rising in the mist the strange tenement bldg they ascylto and encolpio live in the sea monster the bacchanale the hermaphrodite 's cavern the minotaur endless splendid dreamlike images on and on i wonder why it is italians are such master of the visual in this manner i think of visconti antonioni even scorsese and the maybe it 's that renaissance artist legacy from my buddy like you i saw it a few times decades ago the images are so strong and mysterious images that render volumes of emotions that are so deep echoing a memory that is never realized modern day scorsese manages it zefferelli too that is true even the older films from de sica capture images that are unforgettable wells has done it but what you 're talking about is i suppose secular in nature icons derived from the human experience that has meaning from within the human soul not from an outward omnipresence of theology satyricon is almost existential as a presentation of true human nature done with and framed in such a way that is evocative amazing dream art ! ||| 1
this is too good to be true after purchasing this based on reviews alone my partner and i sat down to watch it not knowing what was about to take place for the next three hours we were absolutely shocked and entertained this has got to be one of the most original shows ever to be created its got it all comedy drama and twisted minds i have to admit i 've taken a few lessons from jill and her methods do work seriously though it was just plain amazing and i hope series two will be out soon it is not for the easily offended but for those there is always the brady bunch the lamest thing ever to grace television for the rest of us well nighty night highly recommended ||| 1
gilbert gottfried is a genius thank you for making a dvd that puts so many dirty jokes where they long together ! of course i knew a few but i learned so many more ! gilbert 's delivery is priceless and his impressions of comics like bill cosby and jerry seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier if you 're a fan of filthy humor this dvd is a must have ! my personal favorite is about the guy who does n't know if his wife has vd or tb and at 13.99 it 's a steal do not miss this one ||| 1
more than male '' and female '' more than your view or her view or my view or any one person 's view of what makes male '' and what makes female '' and everything in between sexuality gay straight bi asexual etc is different than gender and can have nothing and yet sometimes everything to do with the other there are gay men and straight me and bisexual men too whatever they identify as has no impact on whether they are also transsexual and seek into a body that fits them more it 's not some sick fetish or crazy delusion surgery hormones these are risky ! and they would not be undertaken unless other options had been explored and found unable to cease the ache inside gender identity disorder gid is real transition the process of taking hormones living as the preferred gender in all things surgery etc is not a cure but it can make life bearable and i think it 's funny that still male to female transsexuals are regarded more often as real '' and the female to male transsexuals are ignored raci has known she was trans it appears most of her life she started taking hormones while she was still in what should have been her male puberty so of course she looks more feminine '' but that does n't make her any more or less of a real woman '' than the other mtf gabbie gabbie is a lesbian while raci is straight see how this works gabbie likes women raci likes men it has nothing to do with one being right '' and one being wrong '' there is a world of difference between a man relating to a woman and a woman relating to a woman just as a man relating to a man a man relating to a woman and it 's not all sexual it is entirely plausible that a man would transition into a woman and still be attracted to women hello the gender changed not who they were attracted to ! i 'm just so tired of seeing so many people picking apart transsexuals we are not here for your amusement we are not here to be some star in your porn show we are real and these kids do an amazing job showing that but i see that the majority of reviewers are more wound up over the sick fetishes '' and one mtf being more female convincing than the other i would love to see the same folks who brought us this a more emotional struggle to also do one documenting the physical changes that happen and how ftms in particular struggle with the emotional effects of wil ||| 1
i am not sure why the first person would direct people to read michael bailey 's work or why the second person would say that it is as if michael bailey wrote this himself one he could n't have because it is a documentary and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community and he was forced to resign from northwestern university as the department head because of his illegal uses of his patient 's information in his book they seem like different species because they are '' i am not sure if i would say that the kids in this documentary are another species or even that i am another species they are humans as well and to reduce them to another species is simply rediculous i am not sure why everyone is referencing him because his view on transgender people is extremely negative but to the documentary i think that it gives a great overall view of the trans community showing that we can stem from all different backrounds and we can act in all different ways just as there are many different normal '' gendered people there are many different trans people as well i believe that scubaotter '' has the best overview of it ||| 1

an excellent comedy kindergarten cop brings to the screen the story of a detective that goes undercover to find a key witness and track down a dangerous criminal what complicates things is that it 's arnold schwarzenegger and he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher the film combines comedy with action and adventure though it is primarily a comedy and a great one at that ! arnold schwarzenegger ! and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! very well written and very well presented it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again ! the setting the plot the dialogues the humor and the music are all wonderful ! in short kindergarten cop is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection if you have n't done so already ! ||| 1

since i 've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items i 'm not gon na repeat anything about each show see individual reviews for that i will just rehash what i have all along despite its missing pieces from the book the original is still 5 star material the in betweener '' is only worth it 's value because it is a disc copy as opposed to a tape copy my advice buy the original separately and read the book to get the real missing years '' if you are building a library of all richard chamberlain '' then buy both or this combo but be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged missing years '' has to offer again see separate review ||| 1
i found this series to be fun gritty and lifelike the characters in the precinct remind me so much of guys i used to work with on the job certainly some artistic license is taken but for the most part this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs denis leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian but a really talented character actor his supporting cast fits well and all in all i would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of rescue me or denis leary ||| 1

this is probably one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen those who do n't think it 's funny are those who are easily offended if you are easily offended or politically correct you probably wo n't enjoy this film having said that if you like vampires you wo n't necessarily dislike this film i completely disagree with the reviewer who said if you like vampires you will not like this movie '' that 's crap i love movies and i loved this movie believe it or not not all vampire fans are some of us are actually well rounded the person who compared it to polanski 's repulsion '' needs to get away from the bong while both deal with mental insanity the same can be said about a lot of films repulsion '' was just disturbing and weird and not overly entertaining polanski 's work is highly overrated and pretentious we watch films to be entertained not to have whatever it is polanski tries to pull having said all this this is definitely not a film for everyone it was way ahead of it 's time when it was made had it been made now there would likely be a huge cult following behind it but then again maybe not as liberal as most like to imagine themselves we still live in a country of highly uptight people easily offended and unable to laugh at the things we fear or find disturbing if you 've got a sick sense of humor add this to your video library because if you are n't going to be able to laugh at it you are n't going to enjoy it ||| 1

it is nice to see bebe neuwirth in something other than cheers oscar aaron stanford is too sophisticated for girls his age but not for his stepmother sigourney weaver and bebe neuwirth the seductress women are all over him his stepmom ignores him and chiropractor thinks she finds the romantic she 's always dreamed of the joking innuendos are quite hilarious reminding me of the graduate gary winnick the director shot this movie on a digital camera in two weeks and won raves at the festivals the little captions before or after a scene kinda tell you how oscar is working or getting worked over john ritter dad apparently serious but funny and the whole cast gives strong performances certainly earning their street creed you 'll find charming nuggets of truth in this movie quite a bit of wit and hilarity sure oscar is 15 and rather than opening his eyes to girls they open his his daydreams about his stepmom are electrifyingly filmed as for the morality i think people are a little paranoid over this taut striking film if you are openminded you 'll find this film is more about coming of age than what narrow minded people think it is a light film to the touch and men will probably be reliving high school fantasies about the older woman women will like it because it shows how men are nothing more than putty in their hands it is just amazing how much depth this film has in 77 minutes ! rachel alice hunter chairwoman teardropfilms entertainment corporatio ||| 1

if playwright tennessee williams 's southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters this is clearly evidenced in this collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of hollywood in the 1950 's and early 1960 's all directed by true filmmaking masters probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now the best of the set are elia kazan 's a streetcar named desire '' and john huston 's the night of the iguana '' the others are kazan 's baby doll '' richard brooks ' cat on a hot tin roof '' jose quintero 's the roman spring of stone '' and brooks ' sweet bird of youth '' a feral smoldering marlon brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish stanley kowalski in 1951 's a streetcar named desire '' and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen intriguingly one of the extras included in the set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of brando when he was 23 and his stardom seems assured even then the plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between kowalski and his visiting blanche dubois a fading southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown having proven her ability to be a convincing southerner in gone with the wind '' vivien leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability strong supporting work comes from kim hunter as blanche 's naive sister stella and karl malden as blanche 's seemingly respectful suitor mitch now over ninety malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track and film historians rudy behlmer and jeff young provide more objective commentary on another track film critic richard schickel 's 1995 look at kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk and there is also a more interesting documentary on the film and original broadway show the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the dvd version of the film 1964 's the night of the iguana '' deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people but this time the setting is a dilapidated mexican beach resort where reverend shannon newly defrocked has taken a group of spinsters from a women 's college huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations striking visuals and dark humor richard burton is in peak form as shannon and there is also sterling work from deborah kerr as the spinsterish hannah and especially ava gardner as the slatternly resort owner maxine faulk the dvd contains a recent featurette and a vintage video both fascinating baby doll '' is an entertaining hoot that does n't seem as sensationalistic as i 'm sure it was when the film was first released in 1956. it 's simply a farce about the potential deflowering of a old child bride with a nice pouty turn by carroll baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by karl malden as her randy husband cotton mill owner archie 1958 's cat on a hot tin roof '' is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of brick as an asexual protagonist this in spite of stellar performances from elizabeth taylor paul newman and burl ives newman is even better as gigolo chance wayne in 1963 's sweet bird of youth '' and he is matched all the way by geraldine page 's performance as faded movie queen alexandra del lago a role that would have ironically been ideal for ava gardner the weakest film of the set is 1961 's the roman spring of stone '' about an aging american actress living in rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo a decade after streetcar '' the leigh excels in the title role while a young warren beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo paolo even though his accent is a little too emphatic all four of these movies come with featurettes and original trailers and cat '' also includes commentary from williams ' biographer donald spoto the focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary tennessee williams ' south '' which highlights insightful interviews with williams in the new orleans area the film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary you can have the privilege of seeing broadway 's original blanche dubois jessica tandy and compare her work to leigh 's as well as an impressive turn by maureen stapleton as amanda wingfield in the glass menagerie '' this is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of century american cinema ||| 1
when i first watched this tv movie with an unusal turn by lucille ball as a homeless woman i was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished bag lady '' although definitely within the tv movie '' league this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy ||| 1
oh my i love this movie it even makes me cry it 's sexy cute and heartwarming yes it 's a little bit hokey but what musical is n't i am so excited to get this ! i love this movie i 'm a huge musical fan and i 've been waiting years for this one they must have finally convinced whomever had the rights to release it on dvd i do n't know but i 'm really excited ! one hundred million miracles ! i love that philosophy it makes me happy and it 's a miracle that this is finally available get your to watch it ! ||| 1
this is worth buying just to see 1. the look on pete townsend 's face when billy idol as cousin kevin puts his arm around pete 's shoulder 2. steve winwood realizing he does n't actually know the words to the listening to you i get the music '' section of the last song 3. roger daltrey fumbling with a microphone that he 'd tossed in the air and unsuccessfully attempted to twirl and catch 4. some of the most hilarious haircuts and outfits in the history of rock and roll 5. the only halfway decent thing phil collins as uncle ernie ever did in his entire career this 3 dvd package also includes quadrophenia and the second set from the night that tommy was recorded this second set is full of hits and it 's definitely worth watching you could purchase tommy and quadrophenia individually but you 'd miss out on this hits disc ||| 1
i 've heard it said that if you have n't read the book you 'd be lost in this movie i read the book and it was still a bit confusing ! i like this version of the film with all the extra footage such a fantastic looking picture this was i saw this in the theater when it came out i remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing sting was touted as starring in this film when in reality he had a supporting role shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band the police it was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater having said that sting is actually pretty good in this film he sneers he wise cracks he fights and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo of course he gets killed in the end oh well ||| 1
this is one of the best sci fi films from the 70 's not to be missed ||| 1
although i enjoy pilates and yoga i need a good workout that makes me sweat boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose but there are times where i prefer to feel the burn at home to that end one of the best dvd workouts i 've found is crunch boot camp training '' the workout runs for about 30 minutes which is great for those days where i want a shorter but still effective one it 's short because exercises are combined together in order to minimize time and maximize benefit for example pound hand weights are used to work the upper body while doing squats and lunges abs and obliques are worked on the floor with different types of crunches and during standing cardio work by side knee lifts of course a boot camp workout would be incomplete without pushups there are three sets each with a different emphasis to shake things up and the lower body is worked in as well a session concludes the proceedings as for the instructor susan hitzmann is one of the best i 've seen on a dvd workout she has an infectious enthusiasm that challenges and encourages at the same time she calls well using a clear and authoritative voice i also enjoyed the chemistry between her and the rest of the class this is one of the few dvd workouts where i can identify with the assistants because they look like they are actually working out they moan groan and laugh like real people and plastic smiles are kept to a minimum finally the generic accompanying music complements the workout without overwhelming it there are two caveats for crunch boot camp training '' first it might be hard on someone with sensitive knees because there are a lot of squats and forward lunges i had an acl recon years ago so i usually do backward lunges in place of the forward ones the workout also features backward lunges also the routine 's fast pace and combinations may confuse or wear out beginners but easier variations are demonstrated by a woman on the instructor 's left side so this is a workout you can grow into even so if your body takes time to get limber due to age or previous injury you may want to warm up on your own beforehand crunch boot camp training '' is an excellent boot home workout i own a large number of exercise dvds and this one 's on my stack highly recommended ||| 1
well i thought it was going to stop at volume 1. but i guess it did n't but i am amazed that some of the cast is still living i ca n't believe that skip hinnant who plays fargo north decoder has got gray hair and still seems to be in good health not to mention jim boyd who plays arthur crank is also still alive but on the heavy side as for judy graubart i ca n't believe how old and skin and bones she is she must 've been the oldest actor on the cast because now you should see her today hattie winston poor thing i think she must 've suffered a stroke or something cause i 've noticed in her interviews she twitches every now and then we hardly ever see morgan freeman in any of these interviews because he 's a big time busy actor but i loved the show and am glad they brought this collection together in another set of dvd 's from a show i grew up watching when i was 10. luis avalos who i loved watching not just on the electric company but in his acting career in movies like stir crazy and then a full role in dom deluise 's hot stuff along with his family luis still looks the same but has gained some weight too like jim boyd it is great that the graphics and color of the sets on each show brings back memories and the songs they sang too brought back some memories it is also hard to believe that the voices you hear on the cartoon skits like letterman are zero mostel gene wilder joan rivers and mel brooks you would n't have thought that there voice talents would be a credit to their success today well now we have to get ready for volume 3 there be let 's hope so cause i will surely buy it ! ||| 1
we recently purchased this dvd for our three year old son who is obsessed with john deere tractors he watches it over and over again until we ca n't take it anymore the songs are catchy and you will find yourself humming along even if you do n't mean to if you have a child who loves john deere then this is a perfect dvd for them ||| 1
what do i think of when someone says disney ! '' hmmm kiddy films girly stuff princess groan we do n't need more of that ! dreams come true and cheesy yep all of the things above are in ice princess with some fresh twists with the mean rival '' changed to nice rival '' and add with hard work '' after dreams come true '' i mean look at sleeping beauty and cinderella what did they do to make their dreams come true which is a pathetic one to marry a prince one had a beauty sleep and the other had a to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand ! casey carlyle was totally different i agree with people that it 's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time which is one of the reasons i give this film a 4 and not a 5. but it 's an improvement the cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done and while people on imdb say that they 're to showy it is true but aww come on this is a movie not a real competition and everybody likes some nice in movies the acting is great especially michelle trachtenberg and hayden panettiere michelle 's acting is really good and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements hayden panettiere 's acting is also good but it 's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and '' ish '' ish would mean that she 's almost perfect she 's smart good at sports and extremely popular also it is very unfair because on the page i 'm writing this review on it says ice princess widescreen edition cusack i know she and kim catrall or the ones with fame and do n't mistake me the acting is good but casey and gen completely steals the stage and in the place of joan cusack it should be the names of those two the soundtrack is wonderful especially reachin ' for heaven and no one delicious songs ! and reachin ' for heaven is currently competing with forty something other songs for a place in the oscar nominations list good luck ||| 1
as usual with a bruce willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was interesting house and mostly believable villains who are the the underlying story of the rich dad his swindles detracted from it i think ||| 1
to have these three classics for this low price is fantastic one film is the 1938 version of the classic christmas carol this one starring reginald owen as a very respectable scrooge if you can refrain from comparing him to alastair sim you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of scrooge and it is a fine one owen is truly miserly and wretched as befits scrooge and very believable the overall production is wonderful the only drawback was the casting of terry kilburn as tiny tim way over the top to the point where he is annoying but all in all a great version and ann rutherford as the ghost of christmas past is fascinating christmas in connecticut is very satisfying a real new england christmas with barbara stanwyck in one of her lighter roles this is enjoyable for those who are alone over the holidays and a great film to watch with family for those who will have a traditional holiday with family and friends i saved the best for last boys town this is absolutely one of my favorites with mickey rooney in one of his definitve cocky roles no one could touch a mickey rooney performance in this type of role he cornered the brash market as he proves in this movie it is a real treat to watch him interact with spencer tracy the finest actor hollywood has ever produced imo he has dignity he commands respect simply by virtue of his own quiet firm presence the other boys were great complements to the production all very natural and bobs watson particularly in his role what a great actor he was ! if you can find a copy see him with cedric hardwicke and lionel barrymore in on borrowed time '' a real i wish i could have been on the set of this one ! they must have had a ball when i saw it as a child i thought it was a movie therefore fantasy and not real when i found out that father flanagan was indeed real as was boys town it gave the movie even more of a dimension and interest his tenet there is no such thing as a bad boy '' is touching in its simplicity and pure simple faith father flanagan 's secret for success with even the most recalcitrant youth was this faith and his refusal to accept any boy 's lack of or belief in himself with ff all things were possible when spencer tracy was voted best actor at the academy awards that year he became the first actor to win the award two years in a row the first was for his part as manuel in captains courageous '' being the gracious wonderful man he was he accepted his award with extreme humility and gave it to father flanagan whom he highlighted in his acceptance speech this movie has drama excitement and some very funny moments and shows the amazing versatility of a very young mickey rooney a truly great buy ||| 1
i first saw this as a child during an afternoon movie '' event at my gradeschool little did i understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting nor did i appreciate the subtle moral of the film namely that good guys sometimes do finish first by the very nature of their untainted goodness oh sure i rooted for charlie and his uncle the poorest of the poor simply trying to make ends meet and who did n't despise veruca salt the bratty english tart with a pushover for a father who acted like the world was her private oyster but having recently purchased and viewed this movie on dvd with my wife and little daughter i was dazzled at how magical the chocolate factory still is even in our age of cg film wizardry and without having seen the new version i ca n't help but think that even the versatile johnny depp is not up to the task of leaping gene wilder 's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon willy wonka more impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward morality tales with universal appeal several deadly sins are on display throughout this film including gluttony vanity greed and avarice and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike the lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated and i have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the century postmodernism that hollywood has embraced i 'll have to check it out meanwhile see the classic and be charmed all over again ||| 1
ok there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film the plot is pure ham and cheese a whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for dracula frankenstein the werewolf of paris and the mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life i told you it was stupid before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current you can accept a movie on the level of a police academy or earnest goes to camp then you should not have a problem with this only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like camp blood this is a masterpiece ||| 1
this is a sweet story based on the cinderella fairy tale only we have sam a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake sam carries on a secret romance with the most popular boy in her high school but she does n't know the identity of her prince charming jennifer coolidge was a scream as the botoxed cosmetically enhanced tackily dressed wicked stepmother she was hilarious in legally blonde '' but really goes all out for this role quite a scene stealer was madeline zima as one of the two wicked stepsisters hilary duff is her usual adorable perky blonde self and is a delight to watch one of the funniest moments for me was at the diner that was redecorated into a fifties motif by the stepmother the poor waitresses were all required to wear pink cashmere sweaters pearls a poodle skirt with petticoats and roller skates if that is n't hard enough the waitresses had to spin as they served people or picked up orders i love when funny bits like this are slipped into movies one can just see jennifer coolidge 's wicked stepmother character instructing these poor waitresses on how to twirl as they served customers this is a great family film although i do n't have children yet i enjoy this film as a break from all the intense films aimed at adults it is fluff but very enjoyable like a cup of hot chocolate included on the dvd is hallie 's and hilary 's music video of our lips are sealed '' and a bunch of other special features as well ||| 1
warning do not watch this movie if you are hungry ! if you do within the first 10 minutes you will pause it and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes i adore this movie it is a heartwarming hilarious story about a widower retired master chef and his three very different daughters ang lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking the soundtrack is amazing the scenery is magnificent and the realness of it all transport you in so that you can almost smell the food cooking i would have killed to be on that set to just sample all those dishes ! ||| 1
based upon director and writer oliver stone 's own experiences in vietnam platoon was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict the movie revolves around a young american soldier pvt chris taylor a young charlie sheen and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty the battle sequences are very gritty graphic and realistic taylor serves under the direct leadership of sgt elias grodin willem dafoe but both men are under the command of staff sgt bob barnes tom berenger grodin and barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict while barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war at its core then platoon is a movie about the internal war for one soldier 's soul between good and evil though stone based the film upon his own experiences there are scenes that have been embellished and the view stone presents is only one view of the war see the film we were soldiers for the opposite view as presented by stone in platoon despite the negative outlook upon life the military and the vietnam war platoon is probably oliver stone 's best movie to date stone 's direction of the film is brilliant from the boot camp the actors endured before principal filming to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes to filming in sequence to recognizing the talent of johnny depp stone illustrated in platoon was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with the film contains fine performances tom berenger willem dafoe charlie sheen forest whitaker francesco quinn john mcginley and johnny depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity despite the deep metaphysical connotations platoon won the 1986 oscar for best picture stone won the best director oscar and also received a nomination for best original screenplay i was surprised and found that i enjoyed platoon though there were several parts of the film that i found myself aghast i 've never been in battle myself but i do know that war is hell nevertheless i can not bring myself to agree with the film 's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one 's soul to evil despite this there are many positive things within the movie this is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well though they might prefer something more hopeful such as saving privater ryan or we were soldiers ||| 1

clueless has been released on dvd before with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features in 2005 for its anniversary paramount finally released a great if not cheesily named dvd edition of this 90 's teen comedy classic with such quotable lines as you 're a virgin who ca n't drive '' and as if ! '' the transfer on this dvd is awesome it 's very clean sharp and clear i do n't remember any issues on the past dvd but if there were any it seems like they were cleared up for this release the bonus features are likeable fluff but at least they 're existent featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members such featurettes as the class of '' which discusses the cast and language arts '' which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon allow us to delve if only just slightly into the making and the impact of this movie also the trailers from the previous dvd release are included children of the 90 's definitely need to own this dvd clueless is still a major part of america 's pop culture today and really who does n't love watching a 90 's teen comedy remake of a literary classic like jane austen 's emma ||| 1

in this set of episodes the battle city is down to the wire my favorite character marik not yami marik is the center of the events most of his character is known in this set it seemed almost if yugi was only a for a while even though i dislike dub this was still good enough for me the scene when marik talks to his brother for the last time or so he thinks at that moment is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime i 've seen if only the voice actor sounded like marik 's age for once and kept the poignant music and did n't use the gold stuff when someone 's mind is snatched and also a shame is that the ishtars wo n't appear for many episodes after this with such a simple exit ||| 1
this dvd contains the basic techniques of krav maga system the techniques include attacks with hands mostly punches with closed fist but also hammer punches elbows knees and feet there are some counterattacks and defences also included at the beginning of the film they talk about angles of attack target areas and stance movement as a dvd extra they present focus mitt combinations to utilize in your training they mention that they will produce an entire film on the subject in the future it is worth mentioning that they do n't teach or even mention the correct falling technique at all also i think they should have taught also palm strikes but for some reason they were left out as palm strike is almost as effective as punch with a closed fist but much more safe for your own hand it should be included in everyones ' arsenal when instructing kicking techniques they mention casually that you can kick also to the head i think that they should have warned against that because in real life kicking above your own waist is considered risky and generally not advisable the presentation of techniques varies from fair to excellent the average being of good quality in some techniques i learned some nuances i had not grasped in my krav maga classes each technique opens up with a dramatized scene in which the technique is used after that they present the technique at full speed and after that in slow motion and finally in learning stages for some reason they have chosen not to use slow motion of a full speed presentation of technique rather the person presenting the technique is moving in slow motion according to the instructions of narrator this makes somewhat amateurish impression of the production speaking of production it is fairly the film is shot with only one camera but for the most part it is shooting at the right spot the techniques are presented in a studio against a black screen but the dramatized scenes are shot in loading docks restaurants parking lots and so on they use two narrators who take turns with narrating the techniques the other narrator is international krav maga federation head instructor eyal yanilov and the other is chief instructor darren levine yanilov does not speak very good english so from time to time it is hard to grasp what he is saying otherwise the production is good and it 's easy to understand the techniques as a krav maga practitioner myself i like the system in this film they have succeeded in presenting the basic techniques very well there are some shortcomings though that reduce one star from the rating of this film run time ||| 1
the picture quality is not very good it 's like watching the videos on an old vhs tape taped off of television i 've never seen a dvd in my dvd player look so not digital the selection is okay the dvd opens playing a small clip of the tears for fears song head over heels '' even though that video is n't on the set but fear not two tears for fears videos are here i bought this because i love the level 42 video for something about you '' and i figured this was my one shot to get it on dvd buy this if you just must have it the price is a bit much for such a short little collection this should really be in the 12.99 or less range ||| 1
capsule reviewer sam graham above is one jerk ! tears for fears and swing out sister are two of the best acts that came out of the and they are still going strong today ! the videos on this collection are some of the most obvious but enjoyable nevertheless it would be nice if amazon would hire somebody to write for them who at least had a little common sense when it comes to music instead of some supposedly hip '' idiot ||| 1
this was n't all that funny nor did i see romance i saw instead four drama queens plus one more wearing pants unlike carrie and her pals this ai n't ex and the city three are married one is not and all deserving pity three have money one does not olivia 's a maid she walked out on her teaching job and now is underpaid franny got hers in a will jane from designing clothes christine is a writer while olivia 's debt grows despite the money that they have none of them are content insecure and neurotic and certainly high rent but if you really look at them they reflect our inner fears getting fat and getting old and thinking no one cares to enjoy this chick flick movie you have to dig down deep explore your inner feelings and then drift off to sleep rated 3.5 stars amanda richards october 29 2006 ||| 1
'mr smith goes to washington ' is a classic frank capra film from starring a stellar cast of some of hollywood 's best from the golden age '' of cinema it 's not only one of the greatest films of that era but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of america was something to be proud of not mocked yes it 's overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us can the young and naive jefferson smith jimmy stewart survive in the united states capital as a newly appointed senator will he check his ideals and values at the door and play the political game or will he stand up for what 's right against the powers that be '' if you 're any kind of movie buff you already know the answer one of capra 's and stewart 's best and definitely one of the essentials to any dvd collection ! ||| 1

every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for jack ti jean '' kerouac ! to actually see most of kerouac 's fellow writer 's and poet 's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated genius '' that was this brother lowellian is in itself a magnificent production ! i bought this dvd today at a mall in new hampshire and could have bought it for less on ! just a few minutes ago i did order the dvd jack of the beats '' on and ca n't wait for its arrival ! if it 's anything like what happened to kerouac '' then it will surely be another masterful production ! after i write this review i am going to watch this dvd again and experience the same chills as i did when initially watching it for the first time ! anyone that is a true fan of kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius ! to hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of kerouac himself is truly ! this production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is jack kerouac ||| 1
i almost gave up on this one forty minutes in do n't you do that the ending is superb premise working class girl gets dumped by her boyfriend and seeks work by housekeeping well that can lead to something better if you keep house for the right person jacques bacri who recently got walked out on by his wife and who not so incidentally looks sixty well actually he was barely fifty when this was made but you get the point gets his ad for a housekeeper answered by laura emilie dequenne who is twentysomething a young twentysomething i guess there is not much else to say and to be honest i decided i would force myself to watch the inevitable but the director is claude berri who directed two of the best movies i ever saw manon of the spring 1986 and jean de florette 1986 and so i stayed with it at about the fifty minute mark the movie started to get interesting i could feel that old girl love affair was going to take an unexpected fork in the road as yogi said if you come to a fork in the road take it the players have no choice obviously old girl can end only one way young girl leaves old guy for young guy this is biology it will be painful claude berri knows all this and probably a lot better than i do and so guess what well i wo n't tell but you will find that the last minutes of this sexy romantic comedy delightful and especially the very very clever and most satisfying ending just prior to that laura asks jacques for his blessing he wo n't give it but she is right he should and then when we get the final life is so lifelike '' grimace on jacques 's face we can only smile emilie dequenne is delightful as the strangely wise and very natural laura and bacri is winning as the old guy who knows better but on reflection should thank his lucky stars ||| 1
there are so many reasons to love all things canadian national health insurance for all citizens the novelist margaret atwood and certainly leonard cohen a group of singers got together to honor cohen by singing his songs nick cave and bono kate and anna mcgarrigle rufus wainwright martha wainwright anthony et al added to their performances are footage from many periods of cohen 's life interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well we thus have this documentary that will delight cohen 's fans at 72 cohen may have lost a lot of his voice he opines that he never could carry a tune but he has lost none of his brilliant humor the singers are fantastic but why would n't they be with such words and lyrics nick cave sings probably cohen 's most song suzanne '' introduced to the public so many years ago by judy collins one wonders if the group drew straws to see who would get to sing that one anthony is great of course but the wainwrights both martha her rendition of the traitor '' will put chills on your spine and rufus who sings everybody knows '' chelsea hotel number 2 '' and hallelujah '' are not to be missed rufus ' account of meeting leonard cohen for the first time when he was feeding a young broken bird should n't surprise anyone who has listened to his lyrics over the years this film is one that those of us who love and revere this man will purchase the day it is released on dvd ||| 1
i am sure that if you are looking at this then you are a fan of the trinity movies the nobody character is based on trinity but with much more refined terence hill 's nobody has a certain directness and is a much fuller character henry fonda 's career in spaghetti westerns often gets overlooked and that is a real shame if you compare this to his portrayal of wyatt earp then you can see that the love of the western never left him this is much more the fonda that one loves rather than the villian in once upon a time in the west '' itself a great film i love showing this to people that have never seen it they usally like it and then i move on the the trinity films ||| 1
the reason i believe the ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a very personal unexplainable level you see the main storyline of the ring is the fact that this video tape has been created and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual twisted manner it 's up to a reporter woman named rachel to figure everything out she 's the main character of the film along with her son as i mention above something very unusual about the film effects me in a way i ca n't explain first of all the entire film is very effectively the way everything is dark and damp and for lack of better words scary ! the one thing i remembered after watching the ring are some of the things that were on that video tape the mirror on the wall and the location of the ladder are two things i could have sworn i 've seen somewhere before like a childhood memory i ca n't figure out like i 've been somewhere and seen those things before like the video tape used in the storyline actually existed before the film was released in 2003 and i believe i 've actually seen the footage on that video tape many years ago because the sequence with the mirror and the ladder looked familiar i ca n't explain what it is but this is the main reason i find the movie so delightful ||| 1

given that pornography is a business it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often but boogie nights provides it with the sort of skewed darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves and becomes a certifiable classic in the process following the story of eddie adams a almost impossibly teenager from suburban california who achieves porn stardom as dirk diggler before turning 20 boogie nights is both a story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was paul thomas anderson 's directing is as excessive and stylish as you 'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry with anderson pulling out every trick in the book long tracking shots underwater closeups montages views and some moments that approach dirk 's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example naturally anderson also loads the movie up with period details right down to the farah fawcett poster in teenage dirk 's room the platform shoes and the obligatory disco sequences its visual flair aside though boogie nights is also the sort of insanely quotable movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties trainspotting fargo goodfellas swingers true romance etc etc etc but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade this movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it especially its murderer 's row of a cast burt reynolds jack horner don cheadle buck swope john reilly reed rothchild julianne moore amber waves william macy little bill luis guzman maurice rodriguez tom jane todd parker philip baker hall floyd gondolli philip seymour hoffman scotty jay and alfred molina rahad jackson all figure prominently and even wahlberg dirk himself and heather graham rollergirl have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors that said what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like the main characters almost entirely have hopes aspirations and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession jack 's desire to be a serious filmmaker dirk 's ridiculous and reed 's equally ridiculous poetry buck 's goal of opening his own stereo store amber 's attempts to get back in touch with her son which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her helping us see them as characters not just plot devices in the story since there is n't really a plot to speak of the movie is told as a series of episodes with several extended pieces the pool party at jack 's house where gets introduced to the whole crew the new year 's eve party celebrating the start of the 's the fake drug deal gone bad at a rahad 's house serving to turn the narrative in new directions this last set piece when dirk reed and todd head over to rahad 's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt deserves special mention as it 's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory it starts off almost surreal with a skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and rahad clad only in underwear a bathrobe and slippers discoursing as he sings along to 80 's songs on a mixtape from there it just gets progressively darker and tenser with the lighting acting and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as todd kicks his robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control molina 's performance more than anything else makes the scene as he turns rahad into a manic ball of energy and later a avenging angel determined to take his revenge i would n't say molina turns in the best performance i 've ever seen in a movie but it it probably the best performance i 've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie the 's are of course the hangover from the joys of the previous decade as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product cocaine suddenly becomes addictive and dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one fittingly as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties the movie takes a darker turn becoming grittier more downcast and a lot more violent but no less compelling all the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present just in a decidedly less sunny form even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right the movie 's pacing makes it all but impossible to look away well except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end but by then i for one did n't care ||| 1
it is said that suffering develops character surely when photographer zana briski went on a photography pilgrimage to the red light district in sonagchi calcutta in india she discovered more character and in smaller shape and size then she might have imagined peering through a lens into the darkest shadows of life into the world of prostitution to capture the images the world wishes not to see not at least from this angle of truth she saw between the women their children when we think of brothels however we might think of them how many think of children whether we think of these places and their inhabitants as figures of perversity embodiments of lust or the tragic painted clowns of the joke that is humanity it is probably more true than not that these women are rarely seen as well women they are perhaps at best merely meat merely body parts to be used and abused and then tossed aside what zana briski 's photo lens reveals is that these are indeed women human beings and for better or for worse also mothers daughters wives sisters we see in this montage of photos and film combined women who are deformed by the ugliness inside they are broken they are stunningly and fiercely angry at the world that has so betrayed them yet they also have their moments of hope and tenderness all of this and more falls upon the heads of their children weaving between these women are their little ones boys and girls who grow up around the perversities of lust and abuse what might such children be like this is the sharp focus of briski 's lens perhaps we need to look at ugliness to see beauty in contrast the faces and spirits of these children contain both they have in them the despair of those forgotten and betrayed by the world society all around them refuses them a place outside the red light district they are already banned from normalcy they have been witness to humans at their worst and no one outside wishes to bear the weight of such witness yet they will not be silenced and if we do not wish to hear them speak then briski has given them cameras to let them capture their worlds inside and out and bring these images to us what these children capture on film is nothing less than breathtaking they miss nothing their intense talent and power of seeing discovered this film also shows us how briski works to bring this artistic discovery to the world meanwhile also fighting to give these children a chance slim as it is to a life of normalcy key to this is education yet as she soon learns no school in calcutta wishes to enroll children born into brothels at last and with determined persistence she does find one and a portal into life beyond opens for some of the children their photos too are put on exhibit available also now in book format some are saved some are pulled back into the dark the individual stories of these tiny photographers are stories that must be witnessed heard and seen so that they know everyone matters even in the darkest shadows we refuse to be blind to them any longer ||| 1
this is a wonderful story showing the universe can have aliens that are not horrors monsters or disasters for humans and humanity kids or adults can see a picture of aliens not the usual us in a strange colored costume but folks we can not see or even recognize as folks strangers with a problem seek help and after receiving help return the favor aliens that flash thru the night abducting people and destroying property are enemies aliens that come in the night make contact with local people seeking understanding and trade are far more likely representatives of extra solar beings ||| 1

any movie that begins with a civil war ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me although my wife thought i have started playing the wrong movie then again it was really upsetting at the film 's climax to see the texas getting shot up yes i know it is just a film but the thought of finding such a civil war artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here sahara '' begins at the end of the civil war as the confederate ironclad texas escapes from a burning richmond carrying the gold supply of the confederacy it disappears into history where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of dirk pitt matthew mcconaughey who believes the texas crossed the atlantic and ended up somewhere in africa do not ask how '' because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that dirk is right on this score dirk is partnered with al giordino steve zahn and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes technically the boys work for admiral ret jim sandecker william macy who has a hard time reining them in once dirk finds another clue about the texas meanwhile eva rojas penelope cruz of the world health organization has arrived in africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region however there is another problem in that rojas is getting too close to the truth which puts here in danger from the local dictator general kazim lennie james and his partner smarmy french rich guy yves massarde lambert wilson dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing eva and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent al is along for the ride as if rudi gunn rainn wilson for part of the way these narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director breck eisner thoughtcrimes '' the best of these is the speedboat one involving the panama '' which comes relatively early in the film i want to ask whatever happened to saving the best for last '' in a film like this but it is not like they did that in raiders of the lost arc '' so why should that happen here granted sahara '' is not as much fun as that classic film romp but it was certainly more enjoyable than national treasure '' probably because it is not as burdened by american history and national landmarks as that one and mcconaughey and zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality besides i like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine mainly because if this film is the start of a dirk pitt franchise you know al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film i especially liked sandecker 's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth knowing nothing about the original novels i would much rather see the team in action than dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film for me the end result is that sahara '' is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety but if you want more then look elsewhere ||| 1
i did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80 's i had seen winds of war however and at that time i loved it now when i purchased the dvd 's both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction i particularly have trouble with accepting robert mitchum as a virile intelligent sombre alert and perceptive about pug henry i wish some filmmaker curtis would be great ! would do a remake of this entire project making it into a 4 hour feature movie tightening up the script entirely apologies to wouk who wrote the teleplay mostly keep in the historical scenes but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea and do away with some of the long soap opera dialogue scenes keep the holocaust part intact these were the most powerful holocaust scenes i 've ever seen and i 've seen most of them but have someone like kevin costner be pug henry or harrison ford and find a truly young very vibrant natalie an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence and a gorgeous rather naive rebel leading man to play byron briney we need to feel their chemistry otherwise what transpires briney 's desperate attempts to find natalie and his son seem and loved polly bergen as rhoda it might be hard to find anyone better i think and you 'd need a new hitler one who is more like the actor who played him in winds of war ||| 1

of course the movie deserves 4 stars however i wish i could say the same for the dvd what does it take for dvd company to release each dvd enhanced for tvs nothing ! recently i bought a sony bravia 32 inch display and i have a collection of over 600 dvds i learned now about enhanced for tvs '' and how important it is i did not care about it or even know about it since i own a standard tv however all my dvds are region 1 and in widescreen i never buy fullscreen dvds so i did an inventory on my collection and realized the following out of dvds 42 are not enhanced for tvs and they really look horrible when i played them on my pc anyway according to my inventory the following movies company have failed to produce anamorphic or widescreen and i hope that these company will release them in the near future so that we can enjoy them on our tvs mgm runaway train graduate no way out prizzi 's honor fx shallow grave thief house of games dead man walking misery the eye of the needle overboard paramount private parts 48 hrs coming to america primal fear the ghost and the darkness breakdown universal day of the jackal psycho available in the recent hitchcock 's boxset as anamorphic vertigo available in the recent hitchcock 's boxset as anamorphic the game fox abyss i was shocked to learn that my is not anamorphic nor is the latest digipack edition raising arizona the edge great expectations rising sun the ref romancing the stone the jewel of the nile artisan house of the spirits the last seduction the last emperor the eagle has landed bound ps please artisan instead of releasing 'basic instinct ' for the time which most have almost the same specifications consider releasing some more interesting movies with proper attention such as those mentioned above touchstone walt disney ransom what about bob ps it is a great news that touchstone are releasing 'enemy of the state ' crimson tide ' and 'con air ' in extended unrated editions on may 16. i wish though they did the same with 'ransom ' warner weeks presumed innocent note that warner studio is releasing one of the best special edition such as 'shawshank redemption ' 'heat ' 'malcolm x ' 'dog day afternoon ' 'all the president 's men ' and many many more the reason why they do n't release every dvd in widescreen enhanced for is beyond me since soon widescreen tvs will replace standard ones it is a relief that amazon is now stating whether the dvd is anamorphic or letterboxed ||| 1

though based on a true incident that took place in 1914 in the midst of a wwi battle among the scots the french and the germans christian carrion 's film joyeux noel '' nonetheless has a dreamlike quality that says more about the state of our current international affairs than it does about carrion 's telling of this sad sentimental tale can you imagine a contemporary world in which countries at war with each other would stop the warring long enough to drink champagne slug vodka play cards and toast christ 's birth unfortunately the bureaucrats and politicians react to this camaraderie among the different factions as they usually do they condemn the participants and accuse them of treason all of the actors do a fine job of creating characters who genuinely feel like they are fighting for ideals and ideas that will have a lasting effect on their lives and that of their children they are committed they are also of course innocent the ethereal diane kruger plays a classical singer a swede and therefore neutral but married to a german soldier who through some personal machinations as well as a pass from kaiser wilhelm finds herself on the battlefield on that special night of she sings gounod 's ave maria '' to a rapt audience of soldiers attending christmas eve mass it is the moral and emotional center of the film as well as its highpoint joyeux noel '' is a nice reminder of a gentler time a time when it was the moral and social imperative to always love your country to always trust your leaders and to always cleave to your family unfortunately that time is long gone ||| 1
the documentary guerrilla the taking of patty hearst '' is a good solid look at the bizarre story behind the symbionese liberation army the sla how the sla formed what they committed and how the group was finally apprehended the film examines the political climate in america and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary sla political rhetoric aside the sla careened through california on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks but more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the sla filmmaker michael stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment using interviews with surviving sla members russ little and michael bortin as well as archival news footage of the times the documentary examines how the sla led by escaped criminal defreeze cinque zoomed into the headlines after the 1974 kidnapping of patty hearst daughter of william randolph hearst several members of the sla were berkeley students including emily harris who worked in the uc berkeley 's registrar 's office with patty hearst as a hostage the sla began making demands for food distribution for poor communities but lest one imagines that the sla members were driven by egalitarian motives it must be remembered that the sla financed their lifestyle by robbing banks during the robbing of a bank in carmichael customer myna opsahl was shot in the stomach by a shotgun blast and left there to die no doubt the most shocking aspect in the history of the sla was patty hearst 's transformation from kidnap victim to the 'tania ' renamed for an old girlfriend of che guevara who participated in several bank robberies the documentary includes televised pleas from hearst 's parents for patty 's safety audiotapes from patty announcing that she 's joined the group as well as clips of patty 's former fiance stephen weed tim findley a sf chronicle reporter who covered this bizarre case also appears adding his insightful comments the kidnapping of patty hearst and her subsequent to the sla remains disturbing and certainly raises many philosophical questions was she just an innocent kidnapping victim or was she young and impressionable enough to be influenced by the sla 's theories on class war did the fact that the hearst family is rich and powerful have any bearing on their daughter 's presidential pardon well watch the documentary and decide for yourself there 's so much to be learned from watching a documentary that explores in depth an old news item that still remains locked in the archives of one 's memory dvd extras include comments by the director michael stone the audiotapes by patty hearst footage of the hibernia bank robbery and segments of court hearings between sla members and the son of murder victim myna opsahl these speeches from the former sla members as they try to explain and justify the murder of opsahl serve as a reminder of the irrevocable damage caused by taking a life displacedhuma ||| 1
certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they do n't make movies like this anymore ! from the instant when the dazzling artdeco credits appear we 're onboard for the ride of our lives actually the lives of hero cary grant and eva marie saint the plot of this 100 percent thickens as its characters sicken notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble james mason remember him and leo carroll who later played the ghost in the tv series topper superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors the elegant un an aerial shot of cary grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands and closeups of mount rushmore which hitchcock had dreamt of shooting here becoming a backdrop of drama of the films of sir hitchcock i 'd rate this in the top three with psycho and rebecca rounding out the bases ||| 1
as i have found with most baby einstein movies this one engages my very active baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy while i know that watching tv too much is unhealthy she will not even give regular television a second gland which i 'm glad about however there are times when i need her to be more calm like when i change a diaper try feeding new foods and right before and after naps these movies have been lifesavers to me this one in particular is nice because it is introducing the body by identifying the same parts on babies and animals i love to give her a bath and do the head and shoulders knees and toes '' song with her and point to the different parts she also loves to stand in front of a mirror and we 'll point out our eyes mouths etc this movie is a great introduction for babies and toddlers to understand their body parts ||| 1
from the sociobiological aspect the movie conveys brilliantly how the husband that does n't has access to its genetic children will resort to extreme violence it also shows how parents are excited about courtship abilities of their young son since a '' son can pass a lot of their genes with various women in his lifetime eventually it shows how the aging parents can not bare the pain from losing their only son the only way by which they can pass their genes so they resort to extreme violence even if the violence is somewhat spiteful if my son can not pass my genes your son who killed my son for a good genetic reason would n't be able to either '' that 's the subconscious motivation for murder conveyed '' by the genes ||| 1

the film 's title paragraph 175 '' refers to the passage in german law forbidding homosexuality paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871 and as a result homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail magnus hirschfeld a german jewish doctor and a pioneer in the study of human sexuality formed the committee with the goal of repealing paragraph 175. in weimar germany of the an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals and berlin became a homosexual eden '' but once the nazis took power they enforced laws with a vengeance according to historian klaus muller in nazi germany men were arrested for homosexuality and approximately were sent to concentration camps of that number less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made the film gently and narrated by rupert everett is built around interviews with a handful of homosexuals who survived the concentration camps once the nazis took power they moved swiftly and systematically against the homosexual community survivors detail how they clung to vain hope one man for example believed that with known homosexual ernst rohm controlling the sturmabteilung sa other homosexuals would be safe another survivor noted the homosexual clubs remained open after the nazis came to power and he took this as a positive sign before he realized that they let us keep our meeting places so we could be snatched up '' the survivors tell their painful stories one man looks through a photo album in which most of the photos have now been removed another looks at a photo of a large family gathering and is able to pick out the faces of the two relatives who survived one remembers the screams of those hung from poles one man spent years in buchenwald only to be snatched up and thrown in dachau while most of the survivors are unable or unwilling to describe their experiences in the concentration camps the grief the anger and the outrage are just below the surface paragraph 175 '' is an important gripping powerful film those incarcerated tortured and murdered for their sexual orientation should not be forgotten the movement began as a loss of civil rights and devolved into one of the most shameful episodes in history to quote one of the survivors i am ashamed for humanity '' displacedhuma ||| 1
ah chris benoit one of my favorites which is why i was thrilled when i bought this dvd almost 2 years ago personally i think the documentary is good and somewhat i just would 've liked it to be longer but it starts with benoit 's early years growing up in canada then to japan then ecw wcw and finally wwe benoit 's comments make this doc pretty good despite the short running time about 75 mins but the matches are where this dvd really shines there are 15 matches in total and footage from wcw ecw and japan against opponents like jushin thunder liger black tiger eddie guerrero and great sasuke which was footage i loved seeing as it was quite rare this is a great dvd purchase do n't get me wrong my only problem is as i said the documentary it 's very good i love watching it i just wanted it to be longer ||| 1
this dvd provides benoit 's life story which i found very interesting i believe they could have chosen a slightly better match selection but it was still pretty great pegasus kid vs jushin thunder '' this is the type of wrestling i love plenty of chain wrestling huge japanese crowd meaning a very quiet yet applaud filled match this match is where chris benoit became a huge star in japan benoit puts on a great match with a japanese legend wild pegasus vs the great this was another match with plenty of chains and some pretty cool high flying stuff by both guys but mainly sasuke like the liger match this was a and solid 20 minute match wild pegasus vs black tiger eddie guerrero these two have had some far better matches and this is one of those that i wished would have been replaced by something a little better still a solid match chris benoit vs too cold scorpio ecw these two have some nice chemistry together another 20 minute match ending just before the bell chris benoit vs al snow ecw many consider this to be a great match but i just could n't get into it match until towards end chris benoit vs kevin sullivan wcw nitro this was an all out brawl going all over the arena including the bathrooms very impressive finish chris benoit vs eddie guerrero wcw nitro a very solid match with these two great chemistry together eddie and benoit show abilitiese we have not seen for awhile chris benoit vs bret hart wcw owen hart tribute match this was a phenominal match bret is a true great as is benoit you just do n't see this sort of stuff nowadays chris benoit vs william regal brian pillman tribute show lighting for this match and not very active crowd besides that benoit and regal put on a classic chris benoit vs kurt angle raw steel cage match match was amazing benoit and angle are the finest chain wrestler in wwe today and they put on a classic steel cage match stone cold steve austin does guest commentary chris benoit vs kurt angle royal rumble 2003 wwe title match benoit and angle put on another classic in the of the royal rumble just a truly fantasic match with plenty of false finished submissions and moves chris benoit vs shawn michaels vs triple h wrestlemania xx world title match this is my all time favorite match the for wrestlemania xx is often called the best wrestlemania ever and it is n't surprising a long bloody match with pedigrees sweet chin musics sharpshooters crossfaces diving headbutts and breaking tables this is a for anyone who enjoys watching a good match benoit is one of the best performers in the business and this is his story i reccomend to all ||| 1
i 'll admit to you that i love to watch adult swim and i 'll also admit that i like certain types of anime no i 'm not one of those nerdy poke'mon lovers i 'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time i like anime that 's made for adults like big o ! cowboy bebop trigun outlaw star tenchi and ghost in the shell i was watching either watching family guy or aqua teen hunger force when i saw previews for this show start to air on adult swim i thought thought it looked cool it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal but i did n't know the half of it what i got was a version of the old film noir mysteries the series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public in the story 'stand alone complex ' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal or in other words an imaginary criminal it also refers to the structure of each episode each episode can be viewed independently of each other and there is little if at all given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date taking place in a fictional city of japan called '' new port city in the year 2030 stand alone complex tells the story of a special operations called public security section 9 or simply section 9 '' the series follows the exploits of section 9 's agents who range from to as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as the laughing man '' public security section 9 is an elite domestic unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of acts of terrorism and crime their duties include response to serious cyber crimes cyberbrain hacking investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases from they also serve as protection to foreign vips if you have seen the movie then you know that the tv series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole the series of 26 tv episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga in comparison to the film version the series is considered by many to be easier to understand also in comparison the series can be found to be closer to the manga due to the presence of some humor the usage of the tachikomas fuchikomas in the manga and referred to simply as tanks '' in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in the design of the characters and also the usage of the characters paz bouma and saito stand alone complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of production in their application of computer generated imagery this is evident in their digital color grading environmental effects and computer models their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene which adds greatly to the atmosphere i think a lot of people will try to compare this to cowboy bebop as with so many other anime and mangas but that 's foolish stand alone complex is no better or worse than cowboy bebop it 's just a different story different style different sets of charactors and there places if you like anime or manga you 'll definitely like this show it 's complex has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it and not to mention the technology ! even if you do n't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is ||| 1
my wife and i saw love actually '' when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly yes richard curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings but it works and the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in when the movie first appeared on hbo i always seem to find it and could n't stop watching until the end of the movie i bought the dvd and it 's become a family tradition to watch it christmas eve most years and it never gets old i am not a fan of christmas movies i 've never seen all of miracle on street '' or its a wonderful life '' but i 'm looking forward to sitting on the sofa with my wife to watch love actually '' again ||| 1
a solid addition to the rockumentary genre this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career and arguably he was solo with the police at the time of this movie it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting the music is super the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness ||| 1
john ford must have felt very fortunate although he would have never have admitted it to have had john wayne and henry fonda star in fort apache wayne and fonda were by far the great director 's favorite leading men he made wayne a star in stagecoach '' and went on to direct him in some of the best remembered westerns ever she wore a yellow ribbon '' the man who shot liberty valance '' and one of the greatest movies of any genre the searchers '' fonda appeared in many movies with ford as well including drums along the mohawk '' the grapes of wrath '' and another immortal western my darling clementine '' following a pattern that he would continue in liberty valance '' ford analyzes the mythology of the west in particular the valiant heroic cavalry officer who bravely and unavoidably leads his men to certain death thereby obtaining immortal glory fonda plays an arrogant stiff commander who will have nothing less than a struggle with cochise wayne is his subordinate trying desperately to avoid catasrophe this film has it all great performances great direction and great cinematography it is way past time that this great film be released on dvd but it is well worth the wait ||| 1
i was very keen on the early poseidon adventure which i liked so i was keen to see what wolgang petersen a director i do like could do with the story it found it to being a good movie it did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next so much so i lost track of time throughout the movie having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort in which case i would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original the characters are not so interesting nor is the acting the story was better explained in the first one and more believable the special effects are approximately as good the filming however is better as the newer technology shows still it is worth looking at ||| 1
this movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to it demonstrates how connected we all are as people and how seperated we are by only one thing our viewpoints the acting is superb and you get one cameo appearance after another which is a treat of course the soundtrack is terrific the ending is intense to witness one situation after another coming to an unfortunate finish ||| 1
this movie has it all especially for baby boomers of the early 1970 's blethyn as a betrayed widow is priceless and nigel ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks the english scenery is charming and blethyn 's loyal village friends top off the movie 's touching humor and happy ending i have given this dvd as christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too a must own ||| 1
this is a wonderful directed by robert altman tim robbins stars as a big shot producer who begins receiving hate mail from one of his rejected writers he thinks he 's figured out who it is vincent d'onofrio goes to meet him and in a rage kills him he then falls in love with d'onofrio 's weird girlfriend gretta scacchi an artist who ca n't ever finish anything there is also a movie within the movie which has to do with the making of a melodrama in which an innocent woman is about to be executed only to be rescued at the last minute by the altman 's theme has to do with the hollywood version of reality which is nothing more than what will earn big bucks it has nothing to do with truth '' a long list of hollywood stars make cameo appearances it 's really a movie very classy and hip altman also satirizes hollywood power players extremely well it 's a whole other world out there in lala land ||| 1
i 've actually been hoping for a live cd release but i was more than happy with this dvd all the favorites are here only a minor gripe with the omission of echo and and the inclusion of priceless but that 's just personal preference this is all the evidence needed to show that this band has reached maturity drive is an unexpected change but being the most song in their lineup the obscurity is welcome the musical talent all around seems much improved from the previous dvds and each member gets to show off all their new tricks unlike some other bands incubus seems to perfectly display each musician 's talents so well with each song and this showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly every song is a highlight on this one my favorites are made for tv movie and sick sad little world other notes it 's the perfect place to film for a dvd we get to see brandon play guitar and how well ben works as a backup singer and i think jose could make any rock band sound good recommended for any fan of incubus especially of their newer material ||| 1
when i first found the broadway lost treasure serier on amazon i nearly jumped up and down in my seat any broadway clips that i can get a hold of i definitly must get i bought broadway lost treasure i and broadway lost treasures ii together i must say the performances were very good just because you ca n't call broadway bad the way the performances were put together however was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic jerry orbach angela some of my favorite people but i wanted i little bit more background information on the shows and things like that overall i encourage purchasing broadway lost treasures ii and the first one if you keep an open mind if you dont know alot about broadway then this will bore you to tears this is not what you should purchase if you want to learn more about broadway if you are more interested in learning more about broadway rather than just seeing performances then i would buy broadway the american musical '' which can be found on amazon ||| 1
i bought this as a dvd for home use i wo n't repeat the story as others have done so already i loved the story the plot was well put together and solid the acting was wonderful i have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time i see it i really am enjoying the fun of this film i 'd suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film it is made to be light with family values of what counts in life tim did an outstanding job as he always does the chasing scenes with tim on all fours becoming a dog the dog behaviors as a human had me rolling it is one of the funniest films i 've seen in a long time as an adult i loved it and would buy it again i 'm thrilled to see disney making such terrific and wonderful films it was tastefully done the caged scenes were carefully done no bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the disney films and no i did n't perceive this as a film geared toward small children perhaps and up would be my guess to demean the film based on the expectation that tiny children would appreciate the story is not realistic nor does it do justice for what the film is it is a wonderful film with a great storyline ! ! corinn ||| 1
das boot is an epic film that is very well done i loved the suspense and terrific character moments the thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a nazi in the midst of the atlantic during 1941 wwii going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean the three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film this movie is now one of the top ten movies of all time for me in viewing the dvd i chose to turn on english subtitles while also selecting the english 2.0 spoken language what is interesting is how the english dub has paraphrased certain lines and in others totally changed every meaning behind the statements i 'm talking about the line that in german reads something like i ca n't wait to get back home and the out of a few wild ! '' is rewritten and dubbed as when i get home i 'm going to shower and sleep until december ! '' quite a drastic change but of course sailors in the german navy use language that i suppose is unacceptable even in an r '' rated movie for english audiences there are more than fifteen conversations of that nature that have been translated into english subtitles from the german language spoken in the original dub of the film while the english dub is totally different later in the film there are even lines shown in subtitles that are not spoken at all in the english dub very interesting and fun to watch even with the subtitles on i enjoyed this movie from start to finish i love the epic movies that run well over two and a half hours this one clocks in at a good four and a half hours ! it draws you in and keeps you going from the very first moment to the very last explosion one of the best war movies i have ever seen ! one of the most interesting ironies of this film is that the entire movie takes place within the nazi and we get to see and feel compassion for the german men who fight to keep the boat afloat the irony occurs when the allied forces attack them and we get to experience the other side of the equation very intense and dramatic ||| 1
these are the best dvds out there for babies because they are full of live action animals people flowers water etc i got them for my daughter when she was about 3 months old she loved them then and she still loves them at 6 months they are perfect for the car for long trips to visit grandparents and for afternoons when i need a break to cook dinner she laughs at the kids on the video and loves the animals too the best part of course is the christian music ! these videos are top quality and my daughter loves them she gets bored very quickly with baby einstein ||| 1

it is a gene kelly vehichle and there are three wartime buddies but that 's pretty much where the on the town '' similarities end it is a surprisingly sharp cynical story in which the protagonist 's dreams do initially come due to life circumstances betty comden and the late adolph responsible for so many great film scores as well as the scripts of auntie mame '' bells are ringing '' and what a way to '' contribute very witty songs here including the danubian sung by the guys and dolores gray 's thanks a lot but no thanks '' and music is better than words delivered with a rich smooth contralto '' i wish kelly and charisse had danced together the omission makes the film appear a bit empty but my favorite numbers are still his dance through the streets and her sexy dance with the boxers baby you knock me out '' and i would 've liked the finale better if it did n't have a big looming piece of the singin ' in the rain '' set in the background ||| 1
it 's so silly how michael moore is criticized purely based on what trashy fox news watchers see on tv they claim that his works are fictious anti american jabble when in reality he encourages people to pirate the movie then goes on tour giving speeches full of well researched facts for free clearly this man is doing it all for the money if his words are so insincere why has the president not sued him for slander and why ca n't anyone slamming the movie ever make any specific reference it 's always a general statement about michael moore being one explictive or another and never about something he actually says could it be maybe that they do n't even know why they hate him ||| 1
i really liked this movie and think is too underrated it has a great story line and plot although katie holmes has a small part it is a good one i really enjoyed this one has quite a few twists as well ||| 1
maybe you had to be there maybe the actual film never quite measures up to what has been preserved in the memory of a certain generation and with literary roots in journalistic observations of the blandly benign cameron crowe maybe it lacks the nerve to truly explore the teenage sex blues with the farcical abandon of its vulgar cousin porky 's but even today fast times remains funny with witty set pieces and a host of emerging hollywood stars flirting dating and hooking up to the rock soundtrack of the period as burnout surfer jeff spicoli sean penn achieved legendary status yet special props go to judge reinhold as the dirty old senior any scene even remotely involving customer service he steals it then turns around and gives able dramatic support to jennifer jason leigh ||| 1
it does tend to lurch but i give it a yes anyway because it says not so well something it is still arch heresy even to suggest the end is not near it is very very near and possibly it has already come and gone ||| 1

samurai champloo has been a great series and this third dvd has kept that tradition though the last episode was weak as most recap episodes are the other three episodes made up for it and then some around the time this came out fans of the series were starting to buy the dvd 's more due to the shortage of episodes on adult swim as the last episode on this dvd is as far as adult swim would broadcast they did start to broadcast more shortly after dvd six below are my ratings for this dvd and it 's episodes episode nine beatbox this episode though not very good still has some funny scenes and some action mugen jin and fuu are caught trying to pass through a checkpoint with counterfiet passes the checkpoint officials find out that they did not make the forgeries and cut a deal mugen is sent to do one of their croked errands will mugen stay true to his companions watch and find out i rate this episode a simply because it lacked action and plot plus the man telling the story is looking back thirty years to when the episode occured i do n't know maybe it 's the thought of jin mugen and fuu being old but i do n't dig the old man looking that far back episode ten lethal one of my favorite if not my all time favorite sc episodes ! this episode kicks anus in every way possible ! i dont want to reveal to much of the story line but i reccomend watching this episode ! even if this dvd just had this episode and was still full price i would still buy it ! i rate this episode a or infinite if you really want stars it is though i find that underappreciating the episode to give it a finite rating episode eleven gamblers and jin falls in love with a depressed woman who has been forced to work in a to pay off her husbands debt still a good episode but not the best lots of great humor i rate this episode episode twelve the disorder recap episode jin and mugen read fuu 's diary while she takes a bath this episode has a lot of funny dialogue but that 's the only thing it has working for it i rate this episode well that 's it for this review check out my next review on volume four of samurai champloo i hope this review helped peace ||| 1
peirce really suprised me in this movie he was always so pretty '' in his movies he showed that he can play dirty '' an unlikely friendship '' developes between a regular guy and a hired killer pierce the hired killer is getting older and less steady on the trigger could it be that years of murdering is weighing heavy on his concience or that he is close to his retirement years and dose n't have a real friend in this whole stinkin ' world because of the business he 's in either way he 's like a man in a desert who forgot to bring water unusual buddy film but it works ! enjoy ||| 1

two years later the red sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in september thinking it never happened it was a utopian dream the comfort of the drugged and sleeping but it happen it 's here on film they could n't have made this all up and besides i remember it like it was yesterday the producers of this dvd did n't have much of a world series series to work with the sox swept the cardinals in four the real drama was the american league championship series still the producers have done a remarkable job of building the context of the curse of the bambino the tragedy snatched from the jaws of triumph in years that are branded into the thighs and brains of red sox fans 1967 1975 1986 the new spring hopes that make one feel a little foolish the mind games the despair the it all ended in 2004. it 's right here on film the names now fit comfortably beside those of yaz and the rest of fenway 's venerable ghosts schilling damon still beloved in pinstripes pedro millar derek lowe trot big papi manny being manny 'skip ' francona the undyingly heroic field captain 'tek ' varitek the man paid to steal one base dave roberts the gutsy trade of nomar then there were the demons of this passion play all the yankees but particularly who played the part of a bizarrely emasculated lucifer and all the yankees again and again everybody else was just there that season for bit parts and background noise for big papi 's walkoff homers and curt schillings epochal bloody sock the crux of red sox nation 's unlikely redemption a red sox fan watching this dvd for the fifth time can still not suppress the goosebumps where were we for this game and that game the true fans among us are slightly embarrassed about the fact that we remember where a stroke of intellectual capacity that is supposed to be reserved for truly international events as i write this in 2006 the sox are at home and detroit is facing off with oakland for the american league championship it does n't matter we won it 's right there on the dvd plus the soundtrack is brilliant it all ends in glory after all not ashes redemption ||| 1
i 'm mildly into anime i only watch the stuff that i really enjoy this is the only series that has really drawn me in usually it 's just movies for me but wolf 's rain is amazing i ca n't wait for volume ii to be released on tuesday ! it contains the final episodes ||| 1
this anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network and now is definetly considered a classic alongside cowboy bebop and others this is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people yoko kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect it 's so beautiful and fits the story so well the overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful as for the languages and region while i would n't know yet for this particular box set i would assume it is just like the individual dvds they put out with japanese and english language and english subtitles and i do n't know where to look for the region of the dvd but i think it might be region 1 whatever it means i do know that i have n't had any troubles playing it on any of our dvd players ||| 1
this is a very emotional film it induces emotion in the viewer and for that i give it five stars i 'm more interested in constructive criticism than in praise so even though i think it is an excellent film i will just focus on what i think is wrong with it one problem is that blanche dubois is simply too pretty for the role we do n't understand on a gut level why this beautiful girl would worry about hiding behind dim lighting the script makes it clear that she is supposed to look old '' and yet she does n't that 's a fault of the film it makes her final passionate scene with karl malden incomprehensible he holds her up to the light she looks very pretty and yet we are supposed to believe that she looks terrible in bright light for that i blame the director elia kazan what in god 's name could he have been thinking of and why did he mess up so badly on that important detail another important fault of this film is that stanley kowalski 's attack on blanche is n't set up properly are we just supposed to believe that he is an animal and chalk it up to that sorry not good enough we should have seen it coming again another big by kazan when the script has the characters doing something that does n't ring true there 's a problem we needed to see that attack being led up to we needed to think oh my god i know what he is about to do '' stanley kowalski is actually the good guy throughout most of the movie all of a sudden it turns it 's incomprehensible somewhere between the writing directing and acting somebody dropped the ball somewhere the stanley kowalski who attacks blanche is not the same man who appears earlier in the film he 's not an animal '' he 's not set up that way for us blanche is the snob and stanley is okay but that is turned on its head at the end insanity is a nice little copout we can make our actors do anything and just say okay they went nuts very touching but not very realistic how does someone go insane what stages do they go through blanche 's descent into insanity into an inability to tell reality from fantasy should have been more realistic more researched more consistent with the way it actually happens it does happen to people people who are extremely bipolar people who are schizophrenic more research should have been done to show what the descent into insanity actually does look like i have high standards but that 's a good thing i think still i 've given this film five stars ||| 1
i first saw this movie in high school in the theater i was extremely moved by the film and it triggered a facination with south asia that lasts to this day i even work half the year in sri lanka now so for me personally this movie is of tremendous influence i understand the arguements about the crediting of actors i always wondered why candice bergman is given top billing given that she only appears in a very few scenes well that 's the way of the world it 's marketing right or wrong and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known it 's not right but that 's hollywood i mean better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all yes and you 've got to admit it was quite a debut for ben kingsly wow he 'll be forever known for this role that aside this is an excellent amazing film of course it 's still highly relevant perhaps even more so in our world of fear the movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration a for anyone who feels anger fear agressively nationalistic hopelessness hatred or lost i can think of several politicans who need to see this movie ||| 1
i did n't have high expectations for this movie but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times i 've always like tom cruise and he does n't disappoint in this movie but the real star is ken watanabe as the samurai perfect casting ! and koyuki as the samurai widow was just plain gorgeous the hd dvd transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better highly recommended ||| 1
i think this is a beautiful story about a man who wanted to change his country he was not looking for his lost money he wanted a new hungary the story about a great man love through peace war and blood a great story from the hungarian history everyone who like dramas the century real heros have to see this wonderful movie ||| 1
there have been emblematic films that plainly justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment but few times we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness constancy and dedication like this one we should be back to the times if silkwood or the china syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions on the other hand of the coin and i must confess i have never been a special fan of roberts she displayed by far the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the academy award that year one more thing in order to the fairness i would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance ellen burstyn and requiem for a dream '' and that i keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between barbara streisand and vanessa redgrave in 1967 where the difference in what acting concerns was even major excellent edition and magisterial direction of steven soderbergh ||| 1

on the face of it a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a attachment to an ancient woman seems about as niche '' as you can get but do n't overlook this film the relationship between harold and maude is truly endearing and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic through maude ruth gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit we get a truly unique perspective on life told in such a gracefully sweet way that we can not help but fall in love with her if you like igby goes down a modern interpretation of catcher in the rye you 'll get much the same feeling from harold and maude which is not so much a coming of age '' movie as a look at love in all its splendours ||| 1

the stellar performances of jason alexander buzz and john glover make this movie providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film the swan lake scene while funny is probably the most sad as each character explains how he will pass on yet the most interesting character to me is gregory as he is the glue that holds this group of men together generously offering his victorian house for holiday vacations it is he who starts the film with his narration welcoming the viewer in as if we are a visitor to his home as well and having the final narration during the swan lake scene he is caretaker to his friends in life and in death and the central character that the six others revolve around it is befitting that he will be the last to go each character struggles with his own demons we are privy to their personal pain yet all manage to rise above their problems and find joy in life and with each other 's companionship even the most detestable character john is not entirely unsympathetic yes there 's some stereotypical moments but all in all this is an enjoyable film one that leaves an indelible impression ||| 1
this movie is a great movie to add to your dvd collection especially if you are a mob fan this movie is about corruption within the mob about betrayal about death and dying it starts off with someone trying to whack the don and the family trying to find out who it is and why i 'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story just watch it mario puzo 's the last don 1997 was great too ||| 1
i do n't own this series but i watch it on pbs it 's great they cover a limited number of words per episode and i 'm grateful it can get a little overwhelming my 2 year old daughter only does a few signs but she 's able to decipher anything i sign to her i know mama '' hungry '' want '' cookie '' for now that will have to do for mama is hungry she wants a cookie '' you 'll catch other words from the songs go to the signing time website they have sample videos and lyrics you 'll get the idea a little at a time is good enough for me expert proficiency is not my expectation here five stars ||| 1
i love this series and plan to buy more it is well done the signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting or watch the whole dvd the word is first shown then a mom shows the sign then kids demonstrate including some use of the actual object if appropriate my child and i have both picked up signs quickly from this dvd ||| 1
the bad sleep well '' is a forgotten gem from one of japan 's great masters akira kurosawa his other two shakespeare adaptations throne of blood '' macbeth and ran '' king lear are much more famous and justifiably so if you have seen them ran '' is particular is my favorite of all kurosawa films however this sharp and caustic adaptation of hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition it may be the most bleak subject matter that kurosawa ever tackled the corruption in the highest levels of government in japan the film begins with a long but funny wedding sequence that illustrates kurosawa 's great skill as a director we and the camera are among a group of reporters discussing the numerous convenient reasons for the marriage the bride is lame and the daughter of iwabuchi the head of corporation and the bridegroom nishi has aspirations to elevate his status in the business we see the comedy of manners play out in this sequence in increasingly humorous situations as the various parties deny these rumours and reporters comment to each other culminating in the panicked looks on the faces of the corporate as the wedding cake arrives in the shape of their office building public with a red x marking a spot in one of the windows where one of their former partners commited suicide it 's a virtuoso sequence that perfectly sets up the tone of the rest of the film the newspapers have a field day with this especially when various members of public are investigated for fraud and embezzlement yet they stoically remain silent and the case goes nowhere then it heats up again as a few of them commit suicide the rumours are that they were goaded into doing so n fact they were however without any substance to press the matter the case is dropped and that 's when the real story begins one of the public corp executives wada survives and is rescued by nishi and his shadowy accomplice itakura this is followed by a brilliant scene in which wada is taken to his own funeral and observes the farce all the while nishi plays him a tape with moriyama and shirai his former partners plotting his murder the way kurosawa stages this is masterful the sublime music emanating from the funeral is contrast dramatically with the words of public corp as wada listens on one of the ways wada contributes is to scare the living hell out of shirai wada poses as a ghost of himself in order to freak out shirai a pointed but clever method of tying in the ghost in hamlet as the plot progresses nishi reveals his reasons for saving wada and exacting a very personal revenge on iwabuchi and his cohorts the story 's pace becomes more frantic and exciting technically kurosawa is at his best here the wedding and the funeral are both marvels and they contrast each other perfectly he uses a lot of intriguing compostions for his interiors that serve to highlight his characters ' inner thoughts but very little movement of the camera in order to manipulate his audience the dark nature of the story is enough to suck you in one of the fascinating observations in the bad sleep well '' is that all of the characters are morally bankrupt and filled with secrets even nishi the protagonist his wife the ophelia character is the only one that kurosawa allows us to feel sympathy for and even then in the end she is not fully spared her grief taken in this context kurosawa 's hamlet becomes a study in the morality and pragmatism of revenge but also an incisive jab at the fat cats in modern japan if there is a flaw in the film it is that the overall pacing is not always brisk enough to sustain the long running time 2 hours the wedding despite being absolutely essential is protracted the rest of the film is much quicker but still drags in parts also kurosawa seems unsure about his ending the film ends quite abruptly but appropriately in terms of his larger point about the hopelesness of fighting the rampant corruption i would argue however despite these flaws overall the bad sleep well '' is a masterful and dark excursion into the seedy side of corporate crime using shakespeare hamlet brilliantly but not completely as it 's core toshiro mifune in particular gives one of his most unique performances instead of his usual fiery exterior we get a performance full of internalized anger throughout highly reccomended ||| 1
the thomas crown affair '' gets better everytime i watch it i spot something i missed hear music which i heard but never listened to and see how it relates to the movie actually hearing the windmills of my mind '' this is an unbelievably good movie although i prefer the original 's ending ||| 1

jude is a very powerful film it is also very disturbing but it is absolutely a must see this is an adaptation of thomas hardy 's last novel the film is n't exactly like the novel but if you can ignore that then you 'll find that this is quite a terrific film just do n't expect exactly what you got from the novel over all i give it four stars ||| 1
i waited years for this movie to be released in the united states as far as i was concerned it was n't about the acting as much as it was about the feeling '' the actors wanted to portray in which they profoundly accomplished i would recommend this movie to anyone who can reach that one step deeper into the minds of creativity and passion and appreciate the struggles of rising above and beyond the pain of broken dreams ||| 1
murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a regular don juan '' to his neighbor winston a family man murrey gets talked into visiting 4 women whom he knew 20 years ago searching for a possible son whose existence is unclear and who may just be a hoax the visits are all shocking in different ways all women live in similar locations though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth all encounters are odd the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident she was number 5 in the list of suspects '' for the mother of the phantom son do n't watch this film if you need action or a plot if you are happy with smart dialogues odd situations great acting a script worked to perfection this is one for you ||| 1
this is one of my favorite movies and i find it unfortunate that not too many people know about it i think it is important for people to know this story everyone should watch this movie simply because it is fantastic ||| 1
the medium '' instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005. i usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal which tuned me in however it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating patricia arquette who was in ed wood '' with johnny depp plays alison dubois her emmy win for best actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry but the chemistry with jake weber who was in meet joe black '' and plays her husband joe is riveting they fight spat try to mask conflict in front of their kids juggle an impossible number of tasks and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of alison 's psychic ability i found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show i still wanted to watch them over episodes of csi miami that i had not seen when i bought the dvd i was hoping there might have been an episode i 'd missed but i 'd seen them all between nbc lifetime reruns several times i 'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing alison 's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together what impresses me about alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing in a world of violence it 's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points in the episode in sickness adultery '' her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her as she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife she finds that her best defense is the truth the two older daughters are also jewels maria lark as bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream mom please stop doing that ! '' sofia vassilieva as the older aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing david cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with arquette miguel sandoval as the district attorney manuel duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show perhaps we will sometime see more about his family while it 's hard to pick my favorite first season episode the complex plot of a priest a doctor medium walk into an execution chamber '' is a jewel with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder the dvd commentaries and introduction to the alison dubois really give excellent background for fans of the show this is one show that reaches the level of art for me its excellence will make it memorable for a long time this dvd collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection bravo ||| 1
i was happy to see a 'romantic comedy ' that did n't line up with every other formula picture in the genre really fun stuff and some solid acting ||| 1

while i 've always loved blade runner the theatrical cut '' was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation harrison ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped but hollywood in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience 's intelligence and artistic sensitivity stuck with it anyway on the assumption that we needed to be with sophomoric incompetence equally stupid though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted was the inappropriate sappy ending which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well it did n't even make any sense the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars but hollywood with characteristic cowardice trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience rick deckard 's fate at the end of the director 's cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982 and the subsequent vhs audience it reminds me of what orion pictures did to george romero 's monkeyshines since when does a romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots or how about the happy ending '' grotesquely grafted onto terry gilliam 's brazil the extra footage between deckard and rachael while not extensive enriches the characterizations however modestly and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end the only thing i regret is that the extra bloody footage in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes found on the old vhs tape was not included in the director 's cut which means that this is not fully the director 's cut the material was left out to garner the sacred almighty r '' rating upon the film 's as it was the first time around one would think it would have been restored on dvd but warner with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude decided against it they probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that ridley scott would have wanted it that way can anyone say eyes wide shut '' the fact that there are viewers course enough to value the theatrical cut '' and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all and definitive '' the director 's cut is despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again by anyone ||| 1
this was an excellent experience my movies arrived very promptly and i have had the pleasure of watching them numerous times everything went well the dvd 's were still in their original wrapping and excellent condition ! i will definitely order from here again ||| 1
i really like this video because of its time 30 minutes regular with 10 min bonus segment 40 min total and i like the instructor janice is really good calm cues well doesnt talk a lot and is not overly inspiring she clearly points out the person who will be doing impact moves and then continues on there is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn no hard choreography either i use this a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one i enjoy to return to there are 3 segments each focusing on a different section core upper and lower body the bonus segment is a high segment combining all elements worth the time ||| 1
an amazing film ! not only is it a fantastic adventure but the story is well laid out just the right amount of special effects great music and good actors when seeing this movie at the theater i was not too excited but when watching it a couple more times realized how awesome it really is not nearly as gory as gladiator but is similar in style 5 out of 5 ||| 1
i have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding robert kennedy and i 've got to say that this is by far one of the best pieces of work i 've yet to see the movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience 's attention allows for us to actually what robert kennedy is feeling to sense the tension during chaotic times and most importantly to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for america this movie is extremely provides excellent insight to the inner of robert kennedy and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from kennedy 's life if you are looking to pick one movie on robert kennedy this is it this is the one you want to watch after watching this you will see robert kennedy in a way you never have before ||| 1
i just finished watching most of it and it 's not too bad the thing that most struck me is it does n't take very long to see which were the eras for superman that had the most influence on bryan singer he spent quite a bit of time explaining how hard it was for them to get superman started then we 're quickly through the comics and the kirk alyn eras then it slows down for a long retrospective of the george reeves years both in superman and the mole men and the adventures of superman then it blows through again through the comics and the animated series of the and then stops again for a lengthy study of superman the movie then briefly about superman ii superman iii superman iv the quest for peace and superboy then briefly on lois clark the new adventures of superman and superman the animated series and then we slow down again for a lengthy study of smallville and then it becomes a big commercial for superman returns or at least that 's how i perceived it singer 's got great respect for george reeves superman the movie and christopher reeve and smallville and that 's pretty much it most anything else he quickly blew through as if it were completely well except for his own movie but i expected that part produced by bryan singer and narrated by kevin spacey you 'd have to be pretty stupid not to realize that at least a chunk of it would be dedicated to selling the new movie i had to turn it off at that point not that i disliked superman returns but as soon as kevin spacey said how the actors in superman returns were perfect '' for their roles and then began discussing kate bosworth as lois lane i started getting nausiated i will give credit they were remarkably honest with their assessments of the various projects i loved it when annette o'toole a fan of the character who played lana lang in superman iii and martha kent on smallville expresses shock that there was actually a superman iv there was a superman iv ! i never saw that one ! '' she did n't miss much i thought it was refreshing that though they never got nasty about stuff if a movie was a disappointment or a comic storyline flopped they pretty much admitted it and i liked that ilya salkind was willing to take some of the blame for the bad blood that happened behind the scenes of superman the movie and superman ii it reflected well on him that he did n't just blame richard donner as he might have been apt to do while they were doing their fighting back in the day but i do think it needed more balance we did n't need to spend quite so much time watching clips of george reeves or of seeing christopher reeve with his sweat stains those moments and the stuff from smallville could have been trimmed down nicely to give more time to other elements perhaps more of the animated league unlimited era or to lois and clark there were also some moments where they went back to talking about the comics even though it was periods where nothing significant was happening in the comics as if someone said hey we have n't acknoweledged that the comics are still in production at this point we should say something thus too making the whole thing feel dry and unbalanced btw i recognized a comic from my own personal collection ! there 's a shot at one moment where the ground is scorched into the s '' symbol then a hand comes up out of the dirt and then clark appears and walks off i have that comic it 's an alternate storyline issue the first time they kill off superman and in the same issue superman and lois wed and this was all long before doomsday it 's actually a very cool story ||| 1
saw the names kathy bates barry manilow and julie andrews so had to give it a view best film ever best lines in a film ever as well julie andrews is in the cockpit '' thank god '' that alone has enriched my life beyond measure ||| 1
only the timidity of the studios could explain how this movie landed on the shelves without even a mention it 's up to word of mouth to save it and it 's certainly worth saving nobody does the awakening matron '' like kathy bates see fried green tomatoes '' and her grace beasley is a delight as she finds her backbone and her voice she needs it her meredith eaton is an dwarf with no inhibitions and dan ackroyd is the wettest blanket this side of the johnstown flood after being dumped by her husband patronized by her son and deprived of her grandson grace has no choice but to look after herself grace goes to england to attend the funeral of her idol jonathan pryce in fine voice and having the time of his life and meets his gay lover rupert everett after swallowing her shock the unlikely pair returns to chicago to track down pryce 's murderer the performances are all fine the pace is feathery the music easy on the ear it 's all whimsical and preposterous and the kind of movie that will have you laughing out loud when you 're sitting home alone the ultimate test of a comedy unconditional love '' passes the test enjoy it and spread the word ||| 1
i love this video i get up before anyone else so that i can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long it 's a fantastic meditation though that centers me for the entire day ravi singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear ana brett does the poses very clearly and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses i have already recommended this video to friends ||| 1

office space '' is a very funny comedy many parts of the film were a delight in the beginning when everyone is stalled in traffic i knew the feeling working at initech corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of peter gibbons ron livingston besides having a job he hates he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is then there is his boss lumbergh an arrogant jerk life for peter gibbons is just one boring day after another that is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion and demands of his then girlfriend while undergoing hypnotic suggestion the psychologist dies of a but peter is now a changed man he no longer cares about his job and says whatever 's on his mind and his boss lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new peter when peter learns of the impending layoff courtesy of john mcginley and his partner at initech corporation he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus his two fellow and friends are only too happy to go along afterall they 're part of the layoff 's and on top of that the company men want to make peter a supervisor this film is funny on many levels with jennifer anniston as the love interest of peter and the character actors that make up the film it makes for an enjoyable watch jennifer anniston 's character and her dealings with her boss and his flairs '' are also funny this is a highly recommended comedy i 'm sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between peter and his boss lumbergh and the character of his boss lumbergh is delightfully hilarious especially the way he talks the whole movie is very funny and wonderful highly recommended ||| 1
stars listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly with blank stares where is the horror in that sounds like a typical sunday afternoon at the mall to me in fact dawn of the dead 1978 really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film more or less picking up where night of the living dead '' left off zombies are on the hunt for prey across pennsylvania four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies they take refuge in a shopping mall which provides just about everything they need they work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure the walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and do n't bring much in the way of strategy it would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they were n't so tenacious the four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the tv of bombing areas of high zombie concentration they have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere what does fate have in store for them the night of the living dead '' took place obviously at night and in the dark which provided a much more frightening backdrop it was also in black and white which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie this is not the case with dawn of the dead '' which is in color and takes place during daylight the zombies '' are people dressed as they normally would but with their faces painted grey the result is anything but scary tom savini 's effects are hit and miss though always disgusting nonetheless this is a decent film that features some acting and a decent script the anchor bay divimax dvd is also noteworthy with a clean transfer and dts sound mix an extra star for the effort ||| 1
kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular bloodsport '' and like bloodsport kickboxer is no doubt a van damme classic '' there are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences however the acting suffers worse than bloodsport in that department as for the plot revenge go figure but we do n't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie hey it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action fortunately kickboxer delivers it well the movie begins with a couple of good fights right away about of the movie is training sequences but many are enjoyable to watch the final fight is between the villain tong po played by michel qissi and kurt sloane van damme its a rather lenghty fight about 10 minutes which is nice above all else they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on and yes the result is some blood during the fighting kickboxer is the only martial art movie i know of that used this ancient thai style of fighting '' with the exception of kickboxer 2 and a small scene in ring of fire i really enjoyed this i also enjoyed michel qissi he had maybe one line in the movie but still succeeded in making tong po a great villain who also will return in the sequal lastly we ca n't forget to mention the van damme dance napoleon dynamite would be proud also keep an eye out for ong soon han main villain in both bloodsport 2 and dragon the bruce lee story who has a short fight against tong po about way through the movie ||| 1
i have trouble saying how much i enjoyed this movie the plot was well worn but it did n't feel staid or plodding visually the movie is simply stunning absolutely some of the best visuals i have seen in years the jim henson company outdid themselves this time ||| 1
maybe you 've heard that it 's all been done before '' gaiman and mckean prove that wrong with this unique movie it really is something new mckean has worked for years in the comic industry defining a visual style that works at a visceral level the style has many ways to look depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy some times mckean 's work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone other times it 's a of some horrible fear trying to waken disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience i never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life well i was wrong this movie 's imagery defies easy description i can only invite you to see it for yourself and to experience a movie that is truly like no other the video makes me regret missingn the theater experience the sound track generally works well too from the surreal drone of bagwell 's victrola to the nightmare chant of the during helena 's transformation i 'm not normally one to notice but mirrormask 's music complements its look flawlessly you did n't come here for the story light and dark in conflict lost mystic artifact plucky youth untrustworthy the acting does n't distinguish itself either despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes stephanie leonidas does a good job in the helena role with a convincing mix if you liked the acting in the original who series this will rise to your highest expectations the story is n't the strength here you 'll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy ||| 1
i 'm another of those who saw this at sundance and all the things i enjoy about gaiman and mckean 's graphic novels were on display the quiet humor the intelligence the delightful weirdness the astounding visual vocabulary except that in this case the words are spoken by good actors and all those visuals get up off their feet and move it 's hard to describe the impact of watching a mckean painting move and talk there might be those who quibble about the movie looking too animated '' but of course that 's exactly the point to create a world and make it dance the end result visually at least is like nothing you 've ever seen before and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone some of the people i talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull that they had seen it all before well it 's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve a little alice in wonderland '' here a little time bandits '' there a lot of wizard of oz '' over here not to mention a resemblance to gaiman 's own coraline '' but i 'm just as familiar with those stories as anyone else and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of mirrorrmask '' after all it 's what you do with a story that determines its success and from moment to moment there was enough innovation and cleverness enough delight and wonder to make the movie a positive delight when the movie came out in theaters i went to see it again and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog then a friend of mine tried to show the dvd to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the hey in wizard of oz '' the moment when the witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me yet it lingered in memory and when i got older i was drawn back and fell in love with the movie that 's how this stuff works mirrormask '' was probably a little too wild to be a commercial success but i bet it 's going to have a long long shelf life on dvd as people pull it out to tell their friends wait till you see this ||| 1
i loved this movie it was very touching and projected a wonderful image it was a rare find ||| 1

my hat 's off to sean penn for having the nerve to take this role and then really committing to the role he committed way too much though his performance is so over the top he would have qualified for the pole vault in the sydney olympics merely by forwarding a copy of this dvd to the judges dakota fanning is as precious as ever and i hope she can avoid all the trappings of child stardom that have sapped some of the best child actors of the last 30 years todd bridges jill whelan eve plumb i was not put off by all the commercial and know that making a movie has a lot of expenses ||| 1
i am sam is superb to the core excellent performances across the board and an emotionally involving story sean penn is believable as someone who is mentally challenged this is a veritable tour de force for him but not to be upstaged is dakota fanning who plays opposite of penn and is named lucy diamond after the hit beatles song sean penn 's character has to fight for custody of lucy and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer played by michelle pfeiffer for free she helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor all in all a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness one of my favorites ||| 1
this as you may have already read was a very intimate little show made to promote morning view the live footage is as good as it gets and the sound is flawless to boot this dvd really gives you a good idea at how amazing incubus is live most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers every song is a favorite of mine and i absolutely love the way brandon mixed things up on pardon me plus the little comments brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch i still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that i never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet the bonus features are splendid as well if you watched everything this dvd has to offer it would take up about of your day probably there 's that much on here just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs brandon recording warning a lot of this song is a capella and incubus showing how funny they really are the original cut of the wish you were here video is also on this which is pretty humerous a few of the best songs on here are pardon me the warmth warning new skin and nice to know you as amazing and funny as the special features are the standout is really the performance i ca n't find any words that would do this show justice i guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself ||| 1

i have read many reviews of this movie and got tired of the stupid reasons many people have to complain about this movie most comments are so ridiculous that you can easily tell they might have a deeper reason why to destroy this movie even though they know is good well i hope this comments are read by the right people who are not brainless as many others the movie was full packed with action the 2 's attacking the man in the car is just one of the many great scenes the stegosaurus attack was so good the raptors scenes kept me attached to my seat scenes on the cliff were so good dinosours loosed all over the island was very intense on the san diego one of the favorite sequences for many people my favorite sequences were on the island though the movie is intense and full of action excellent sequel if not better maybe some people have not noticed but on this page you can find that the movie was a total success on the whole world whether you like it or not it made 614 millions world wide on the other side the movie was nominate for oscar best effects visual effects saturn award best director steven spielberg best fantasy film best performance by a younger vanessa lee chester best special effects best supporting actor pete postlethwaite blockbuster entertainment award favorite actor jeff goldblum favorite actress julianne moore grammy awards best instrumental composition written for a motion picture or for television between many others 3 wons after this is said i 'm very sure spielberg is very satisfied with the results of this sequel and you know why because the movie was made to entertain and satisfy all dinosaurs lovers out there and it did the is just forgetting once again how to watch a movie get disconnected from first parts and watch the sequel as if it was a total new movie and value it for what it is and not for was is supposed to be better than the first part sequels are not made to overpass the success of the first part they 're made to give you more of what they know for sure you enjoy on the original movie but because of the time issue was not included on the first one go get them all 3 and watch all as if it was just one movie and then think if is really bad i know for sure that millions of people who saw the movie around the world thought the same i did excellent movie ! ! ! ! ||| 1
hello vietnam and greetings ! says bruno kirby as steven hauk in one scene of this film it was this scene where he filled in for radio personality adrian cronauer robin williams who was on reportedly on special assignment adrian arrives in vietnam from america via aircraft at first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the vietnam radio airwaves but they discover that adrian 's brand of humor is outrageous very much like howard stern in real life they also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing hey this was set in 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with the beatles and the rolling stones from the united kingdom when adrian and hauk first met the lieutenant told adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself when the lieutenant first heard adrian on the air the lieutenant was not pleased at all with adrian 's stint you oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music ' not wild stuff '' hauk told adrian in a meeting the 'normal modes of music ' refer to easy listening artists like andy williams perry como mantovani jim nabors lawrence welk frank sinatra and percy faith would bob dylan be out of line adrian asks hauk and the lieutenant replies '' way way way out of line ! '' adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in vietnam and they hoped that adrian would permanently do his morning show there the brass decides to suspend adrian bringing heartbreak to fans when hauk did his stint many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted adrian back on the air one listener said in a letter '' captain hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man 's balls '' another wrote to hauk '' you suck eat a bag of s t ! '' so adrian is back on the air but not for long because sgt dickerson the late walsh the top man of the brass demanded that adrian be cancelled sgt dickerson 's superior loves adrian and even demanded his reinstatement sgt dickerson is transferred to guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant 's abusive attitude the title of this film is how adrian began his morning show on the very last show done by adrian 's friend ed garlick forrest whittaker ed began the show saying '' good morning vietnam '' just like adrian ed tells listeners about adrian 's departure from vietnam we hear adrian saying '' goodbye vietnam '' in a message adrian also left vietnam because of his association with a criminal who 's the brother of a vietnamese woman adrian befriended other funny scenes include adrian teaching the vietnamese how to use profanity adrian doing a parody of the late richard nixon on the air and adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield this film was a megahit for both williams and director barry levinson they were both at least nominated for academy awards levinson did win a best director oscar for his next film rain man this film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like three men and a baby both films were made by touchstone pictures a division of buena vista pictures three men and a baby was a megahit as well both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. three men and a baby inspired a sequel why did n't gmv obviously nobody had any ideas not even mitch markowitz who composed the screenplay ||| 1
i remember seeing this film when i was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling i did n't know what the name of this movie was and i was looking for it in the video stores i stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that i saw 20 years ago i bought it after seeing it again this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago though by today 's standards this movie is rather cheap and cheesy it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling this movie is original having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings that eats people like birds eat worms this movie is a hybrid of godzilla and slasher flicks this is definately material but it 's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories and that is worth more than the price of admission ||| 1
i bought this for my husband because i knew he liked seven samurai he was delighted with the gift and i was surprised to find that i really like these movies too they are entertaining and insightful and a pleasure to watch ||| 1

what a splendid teacher is this ! a soothing captivating movie the students are most endearing i found it interesting that in the special features interview with the guy who made this movie he refers to the teacher as the teacher '' and not by his name georges lopes this moviemaker appears to be of the opinion that there are a lot of teachers who could have filled this role as well or nearly as well well let me tell you he is wrong this teacher is special there are not very many teachers as patient and diplomatic and considerate on this entire planet as georges lopez ||| 1

tim burton 's ed wood '' a surreal is one of the most entertaining inspiring and funny i 've seen no wonder really since it 's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best writers scott alexander larry karaszewski who after this film would pen the larry flynt the people larry flynt '' and the andy kaufman man on the moon '' it 's also got an amazing cast of actors including oscar nominee johnny depp best actor 'finding neverland ' oscar winner martin landau best supporting actor 'ed wood ' sarah jessica parker 'failure to launch ' patricia arquette 'true romance ' jeffrey jones 'deadwood ' and oscar nominee bill murray best actor 'lost in translation ' depp plays edward wood an aspiring filmmaker who 's down on his luck and lives with his girlfriend dolores fuller parker after hearing about a film being made about a transsexual without a script ed pens a script called glen or glenda '' the movie is kind of close to ed 's heart because ed likes to dress in woman 's clothes but he 's not gay while walking past a shop that sells coffins ed meets the actor bela lugosi landau who played dracula in the classic universal film and recruits him to star in the glen or glenda film the movie immediately bombs and is called one of the worst films ever made not letting it get him down ed goes to work on his next film bride of the atom '' after a few more films and meeting a few new people including wrestler tor johnson george the animal '' steele tv personality vampira lisa marie and psychic criswell jones ed goes on to make his masterpiece plan 9 from outer space '' the latter is the only film i 've ever seen by ed wood while the movie has been called the worst film ever made it was n't bad it 's campy and stupid you can definitely see why it would be considered bad back then but it was entertaining and fun to watch ed wood was an interesting and quirky guy which tim burton makes perfectly clear here and depp does a great job bringing wood to life martin landau gives his finest performance as bela lugosi he disappears behind the persona he looks and sounds like lugosi another thing i liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in ed wood 's life through his first film to his masterpiece '' we hear the downside of his life through the epilogue this movie is in the end a loving tribute to b '' movies that is yet perfect as i said the movie is very funny especially landau who gets some of the best lines as lugosi bill murray as ed 's transsexual friend bunny grade ||| 1

this movie sounded stupid when i first heard about it who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense obviously ice cube could this movie stars lisaraye in her film debut as diana who is known to the stripping world as diamond a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school while working at a shoe store she meets trixie adele givens and ronnie chrystale wilson they convince her into quitting her job and working at the player 's club a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named dollar bill bernie mac when diana 's cousin ebony monica calhoun comes into town she tells diana that she wants to work at the player 's club ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of using what you 've got to get what you want '' this movie is a thrill ride and the fight scene towards the end is the best part of the movie featured in the movie are jamix foxx johnson and john amos the plot is perfect and the script is well written this movie has to be one of my favorite ||| 1
i do n't think so be it in the jungle a new york high rise or at sea hepburn tracy were great no argument but they were so modern urbane not rowdy sexy always fighting like harlow gable china seas is a fine example of this chemistry yeah its a pretty good story too gable is capt gaskell skipper of a ship running from hong kong to singapore harlow is the floozie dolly he had a fling with on shore the ship is carrying gold there is a terrific typhoon a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while they torture the captain but he does n't reveal where the gold is dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman wallace berry against the captain because she is mad at him she of course changes her mind the captain is trying to ditch dolly thinks he 's meant for lady sybil played by rosalind russell an old flame but he dolly really are in love unfortunately the collaborations between harlow gable was cut short at five movies with harlow untimely early death several years later ||| 1
let me clear this up you are a true exercise fanatic this dvd is for you i 've done every dvd exercise program including taebo and this ranks in my top 2. taebo is awesome for the cardio but when it comes down to muscle tone this dvd is tops the background music and background exercise people are the least of my worries you have to concentrate on the exercises she does to tone your body ! ! ! these exercises are an all over workout my favorite part is the 20 minute arm workout my arms never looked so good ! ! she works the hell out of you and it took me a few times to get through it but if you want to tone up and get in shape just put in this dvd and be prepared to sweat ! ! ! ||| 1

i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister over and over again laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head or when she accidently dyed her hair green or when she waxes poetic about her bosom friend '' it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old it is a beautiful heartwarming movie with gorgeous scenery unforgettable characters and plenty of moments to laugh and cry ||| 1
it 's a ritual for my 5 year ld daughter and her dad to watch samurai jack before bed back when she was 3 and it was played on cartoon network they made sure to watch it together now that cartoon network is retarded and they do n't play it anymore i 've bought seasons 1 and 2. i just wish it was played on cartoon network like it used to be jill henrichse ||| 1
marc singer is a bloke from england who moved to new york city saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets and became friends with them they in turn trusted him accepted him as one of their own and showed him their secret living quarters deep underground in abandoned train tunnels the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets intelligent and resourceful they had hooked up to free electricity and had working tv 's and stoves what makes this documentary five stars instead of four is the making of documentary only there do you learn that the movie crew were the tunnel folks only there do you learn how singer made this movie with no money equipment or knowledge of filmmaking this movie took six years from start to finish unfortunately it was not the financial success its producers hoped for but it resonates unbelievably the deleted scenes are not to be missed although some are much better than others the one where a man talks about how his cousin killed a cat for food and the scene where two young men talk in detail about recent sexual activities lent nothing to the film ||| 1
another reviewer has said that 5 stars are not enough for this film i 'll second that opinion if you have seen the remake with michael douglas pretend you have n't and watch the way it should be done if you 've seen neither version of the film get this one and get ready for anything this is above all a classically sarcastic farce between two misfits who have amazing chemistry together both peter falk and alan arkin are marvelous craftsmen and their combination of silliness and genuine rolicking humor is blended in an almost pace from beginning to end again as i 've said in other of my reviews minor characters are important ed begley as the cia boss adds weight and color to that aspect of the plot and richard libertini as the south american dictator i 've never seen him play a sane character adds another kind of raucous fun this is a comedy for anyone who appreciates true comedy and if you meet anybody who has seen the film just scream surpentine ! surpentine ! '' and watch them fall apart ||| 1
this comedy starring martin short and kurt russell is pretty funny when i first watched it i was n't really impressed with it but now i find it pretty funny i think that kurt russell as captain ron was pretty funny however it was the antics of martin short who hires captain ron to sail his ship in the caribbean that was the funniest character in the film the story begins when a relative of short dies leaving him a ship which is moored at a small caribbean island the wife mary kay place who is not too pleased at going to the island decides to go along with this crises of short on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat enter captain ron kurt russell he is a very strange and quirky fellow to the uptight and anxious martin short however since short knows nearly nothing about boating he decides to hire captain ron on the suggestion and recommendation of the man who is interested in buying the boat therefore captain ron who is not very bright to begin with leads the family including short 's two children on a cruise through the caribbean and he is a very eccentric character harmless but funny what ensues is a funny interaction between short and russell on their voyage including a scene where russell warns short not to stray from one particular islands path due to guerilla 's on the island which short interpets as gorilla 's a very funny scene recommended it is a family watch that your children can enjoy ||| 1

is it a bad thing to see a movie and deem it good by standards different from which you would judge other movies let me explain broken hearts club is a good movie a little corny and certainly more than a little predictable it does n't really do anything new but for a gay film it breaks all the rules breeder hunks play femme gay men there is no one with aids in the whole story there are butch gay men in this movie and no none of the gay men has a best friend who is a single white straight female can you handle it the movie is entertaining the plot is sweet the best part of the film is the style in which it is broken up ala ' the television show frasier the movie is split into sections by definitions flashed on screen to help explain the next scene the best definition has to do with 'meanwhile ' 'meanwhile ' being the gay term to tell your friend when an attractive male walks by and the movie itself is filled with 'meanwhiles ' dean cain looks especially nice in this film and pulls off the character of a pretty boy with ease go figure john frasier leaves his comfortable role of an on frasier to be the of this group of friends and the coach of their softball team andrew keegan is the newbie of the recently outed gay man finally kerr smith who has been playing a gay character on dawson 's creek for some time play the token gay character on a softball team of macho fireman ||| 1

based on the cliffhangers he used to watch in theaters george lucas created something special a of the entire adventure genre these films waited a long time to make their bow on dvd much too long for myself personally i always loved these films they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time each of the three films is very different from the others raiders of the lost ark '' the first and best of the three introduces us to indiana jones perhaps lucas 's greatest creation premiering in 1981 this film was a smash also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture also starring was karen allen perhaps the most female for harrisan ford it seemed she could give as good she got and never backed down in any scene second was the temple of doom '' easily the darkest of the three and the most intensely exciting this film is a thrill ride from start to finish and does n't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor the third film the last crusade '' is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor and has the wonderful sean connery to steal every scene he 's in the interaction between indy and jones is wonderful if anyone was to ever play indiana jones ' father it was sean connery the forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves these films waited far too long to be released to dvd and i lay the blame squarely on george lucas i 've heard he really did n't think dvd would take off like it did that it was just a phase it 's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy as with his star wars '' trilogy the indiana jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all dvd collections ||| 1
i saw this on pbs ' great performances this documentary is about film genius akira kurosawa the documentary charts akira kurosawa 's early life in japan to the end of his life kurosawa brought japanese cinema to a world wide audience i recommend this dvd for anyone who is a akira kurosawa fan plus the dvd has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the pbs program and kurosawa filmography ||| 1
dietrich bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey his books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues but practical issues of the greatest moment there is a great line in kierkegaard in the preface to the sickness unto death where he writes everything essentially christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed even if only medical experts understand it it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person '' what gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them as he struggled to live out the implications of christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so bonhoeffer was in so many ways a paradox and the documentary does a great job of showing this raised in a secular home he inexplicably decided to become a theologian and pastor at a time when a host of right wing movements were overtaking germany he espoused left wing political and social values in an age of growing intolerance he expressed a sympathy and understanding of both jews and blacks almost unprecedented in the germany of his time and in an age when many theologians wrote academic works with little regard to how they should connect with real life bonhoeffer was obsessed with the connections between thought and practice what is most impressive in studying the life of bonhoeffer whether through reading his books or eberhard bethge 's great biography or watching this documentary is the man 's fundamental goodness and dedication to doing what is right if he had been catholic instead of protestant he would surely by now have been declared a saint he seems to have had the saint 's calmness and peacefulness one is certain that he slept the sleep of the just bonhoeffer was one of the most promising young theologians in weimar germany had he lived in more peaceful times he certainly would have written a host of theological works like his theological mentor the great karl barth who was himself the greatest theologian between luther and calvin and the present he would have written works that explored the concrete role that religion must play in every day life when hitler rose to power bonhoeffer could easily have fled to the united states and taught through the course of the conflict and in fact had an appointment at union theological seminary in new york which he left to return to germany moreover he joined the resistance against hitler and came to believe that it was his moral and religious duty to aid in the attempt to assassinate him after an attempt to kill hitler through the use of an air pressure bomb placed on a plane failed for whatever reason it did not detonate as it should have a host of suspected conspirators were arrested including bonhoeffer he spent the rest of his life in a nazi prison dying at the hands of the nazis only a few days before the american armies liberated the concentration camp to which he was transferred near the end if one reads his ethics one is impressed by sections such as the one on what it means to tell the truth kant had famously argued that if a man that one suspects is angry enough to kill a particular person comes up and asks you where that person is the moral law demands that you not lie to the murderer though in kant 's defense it is n't clear that we are obligated to tell him where the intended victim is but merely that we not lie for bonhoeffer the situation is so much more complex he knew about many facets of the conspiracy and merely refusing to answer the gestapo 's questions would have done much to confirm the existence of the conspiracy bonhoeffer was forced to systematically fabricate a tissue of lies that would mislead the nazis as much as he could while protecting as many people as he could this lends a sense of poignancy to his writing on what it means to tell the truth that is almost unbearable reading between the lines one realizes that bonhoeffer realized contra kant that telling the truth '' might actually entail lying to the best of one 's abilities i had only one tiny complaint with the documentary i love klaus maria brandauer as an actor he is a powerful and subtle performer but his voice on the dvd is very hard to understand i do n't know if his accent is too thick or if the recording has too much bass to be clear i found i could understand only a portion of what he was saying anyone who is moved by this documentary should certainly look further into bonhoeffer 's life and thought i once was privileged to be part of a group of thirty or so students who had a long conversation with eberhard bethge about bonhoeffer bethge features prominently in the film there is no question that if you were to read only one book on bonhoeffer his magisterial biography is the place to go it is massive but it is unquestionably worth the effort i love bonhoeffer 's ethics but it might be a tad too academic for the lay reader the cost of discipleship in which he makes his famous distinction between cheap grace and costly grace is a wonderful book and can easily be read by someone without a strong theological background letters and papers from prison which collects things written from the time of his arrest to the end of his life is justly celebrated as a classic religious work a testament to freedom the essential writings of dietrich bonhoeffer is a very fine anthology that collects writings from every period of his life i recommend this film as strongly as possible to me bonhoeffer is one of the truly great christian heroes of the past century though his courage and sacrifice offers equal inspiration to as well ||| 1
bonhoeffer was a very informative very interesting video i first decided to watch it at the urge of my pastor i watched the portion that pbs showed and i wanted to see more so i bought the dvd i am glad that i did ||| 1

on hearing that warner bros was to issue a set of busby berkeley films i ensured my dvd player was rendered and then i waited it was a dream finally come true having been entranced by berkeley 's films since childhood i could hardly wait for the box to arrive oh joy ! the quality of the dvds is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed if some of these extras are not to one 's taste then fair enough but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature it is a shame that the al jolson number was removed from the compilation disc because it was not intended to be racially offensive when it was produced but today 's political correctness lobby inevitably takes its toll that said we are left with a plethora of magnificence from busby berkeley which gladdens the heart and which left me euphoric because the quality of the release exceeded my expectations thank you warner bros for the tlc you have lavished on this set and you dear reader if you have not experienced the work of this great director before i urge you please please consider buying it i can guarantee you will not be disappointed this was hollywood 's golden age so now you have the chance to experience it please do n't miss out ||| 1
this is a great video collection of her past videos i love it from the sweet 'i wan na love you forever ' to the record label controlled image of 'irrisistible ' and 'a little bit ' i love the 'a little bit ' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop but overall this dvd is awesome i like the footage from the dream chaser tour and the biography stuff this is the best dvd before jennifer lopez 's the reel me ||| 1
look at my review for the movie soundtrack i had a full vinyl copy of the voiced movie but my mom sold it i hate that fact but there is n't a thing i can do about it i wish i could get one back ||| 1
this is the kind of movie i used to enjoy seeing a couple of times a year and now see oh about once every 10 years or so an incredibly interesting odd provocative movie that does n't insult its audience the acting is phenomenal the script is really interesting and the characters are not people you 've seen 1000 times before although it 's sort of about baseball it 's not a baseball movie it 's a pity that so few people want to see interesting movies like this i loved this movie ||| 1
videodriome is a movie i 've been a fan of for years i use the movie as a test to see if people are real movie and horror fans and not just posers the best part of the film is that any day now fox will greenlight a reality tv show where are killed in front of a live studio audience if you 're new to the work of david check this out asap and see what all the fuss is about the criterion dvd is stacked with extras and the transfer is a thing of beauty ||| 1
yes i thought the whoppi disclaimers were absurd how many generations have grown up with these cartoons and now all of a sudden they 're bad '' i never saw disclaimers on cbs when i watched these cartoons on saturday mornings for years and years ! ! ! but aside from that my main gripe is the organization it would be better if they 'd organize these into eras i 'm not as big on the leon schlesenger era from the as i am on the and would rather these be organized chronologically not that i do n't respect those early shorts for what they were i just like the later ones better regardless as long as they keep releasing these i 'll still keep getting them since cartoon network and nickelodean have completely removed them and decided that the new generation of kids do n't have the attention span '' to appreciate them i beg to differ my kids love looney tunes ! and replace them with garbage full of toilet humor which apparently is ok by the pc police ||| 1
i grew up in hannibal mo so i am very familiar with mark twain 's writing and his humor the make up is great as holbrook even looks like twain holbrook is a great story teller and he uses the material well and makes it wa wonderful program i saw a perfomance live in nyc years ago and another one in my current home town each time i see it again it is still funny and a great performance ||| 1
visconti 's film is significantly different from mann 's classic story aside from the obvious changes aschenbach being a composer instead of a writer etc there are many subtle touches that deepen the ambiguity of the character for example in the book aschenbach 's wife is dead and his daughter is grown up and married away in the film his daughter dies in childhood and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits venice another reviewer here called the film ambient '' i would add the word poised '' the camera lingers on scenes for many minutes observations occur in planes of depth the acting is often extremely subtle the young man who plays tadzio looks as if he is sculpted of alabaster compositions lighting settings costumes and makeup are simply exquisite imagine if this had been photographed in ! death in venice probably looks better here than it ever did in theaters the dvd transfer is superb based on what appears to be a spotless pristine source the wide panavision aspect ratio is faithfully preserved anamorphically enhanced for tvs sadly the original monaural soundtrack has not been remixed for stereo but execept for some occasionally muffled dialog which may be intentional it still sounds very good the generation will find this film tough going do n't buy this if you 're hoping to see police gondolas flip over and explode ||| 1
i first viewed this film with a friend in my home he and i are both lovers of beautiful music and art this film satisfies both categories the score is absolutely magnificent and the views of venice beautiful the acting by main character dirk bogard is subtle but effective we found this film to be a totally experience ||| 1
excellent little known movie with viggo mortensen as an agent under deep cover to infiltrate japenese mob great performances by all michael nouri a little over the top great action and sentimentality when viggos character is torn between man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent after makes deal with mobster nouri to make a hit on the yakuza ||| 1
liam neeson was wonderful to watch a tragic love story with great winter scenery and lots of cold breath shots however patricia arquette was too teenage giggly not a terrific actress in this film at least still a great role for neeson ||| 1
one of the best movies i 've seen in ages ! ! ! most movies put me to sleep i stayed awake the entire time action suspense great flick ! ||| 1
upon watching the movie sick i came to an all out conclusion of all other movies i had seen in the past they will never compare to bob flanagans true life experience of living beyond the expected life span of a human with cf this man truly took his illness by the balls and showed the viewer that pain can be an issue that is manipulated in an entirely different way i found it very interesting how bob chose to be a slave to the woman he loves rather than a slave to his miserable disease those who dare watch as bob experiences life through the vice of pain those with weak stomaches beware ||| 1
great plot ! a crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs a good hearted man named dave who thinks about others and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while two of the presidents regular staff try to get dave to do things that is contrary to dave 's character so the story goes on from there who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the white house this dvd picture was good and clear the sound was great and the case was in excellent condition if you like warm hearted type movies then this is the one for you i know i have enjoyed it over and over to me dave is about character good or bad and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us ||| 1
i was leaning towards giving it only three stars because it has certain weaknesses but then i saw the ending and it was a beautiful one it always makes me happy to see love onscreen the side story of a jealous rival geisha constantly hurting our hero was annoying there really was n't any reason for it another part of the story i found annoying was the lack of communication between the main characters our hero was giving one man all the signals that she was interested but she in fact was interested in a different man who she was n't communicating with at all i do n't like having to witness problems that make no sense to me but then came that surprise ending so warm and affectionate that was nice ||| 1
my review of the village mentions the sixth sense more than it does the village so here it is i do n't really want to talk a lot about this movie because i could spoil the effect instead i 'll talk about this filmmaker 's first movie the sixth sense also by night shyamalan i first saw it in december 1999 on a flight from chicago to hong kong my only flight out of the usa the film really pulled me in which i suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane then the ending based on the article you just read we can say that some viewers were n't surprised me i was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again years later i finally did i taught movie classes this is a film i chose and i saw it about a dozen times fully aware of the ending it had a bit more going for it than that my only complaint is with people who think bruce willis was the star the star is haley joel osment ! i may have missed out on the surprise ending '' because i was watching the kid instead of the shrink bruce willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we 'd never notice but i digress the village is about a village some place quaint rural close knit and low tech nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter those we do not speak of the acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood shyamalan is a masterful writer director and producer but i had trouble caring about what happened to his characters that could 've been my fault saturday morning at 8 jan was working and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but i was too drained to begin the neighbor had loaned us this dvd back in february so i figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start the same bad attitude that i brought to the sixth sense right one of these days i 'm going to watch a shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind the ending '' how would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on the ending '' in the case of the village it worked for me i thought about this film for days after seeing it actually i was trying to decide what to write in this review how about this shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium '' that 's a good thing no matter what your opinion of each individual film is i believe some critics are panning him but i 'm not panning this one i 'm glad i saw it i 've missed a few films between the sixth sense and the village and there will be more after the village i 'll watch them all ||| 1
i have four boys between the ages of 11 and 2. i ordered seasons 1 2 and they love it every night we turn daniel boone on before bedtime and we do n't have to worry about our children seeing anything other than a good wholesome show i hope they put out the next 4 seasons ||| 1
i thought this was a wonderful dvd because of the following factors goal of this billy blank 's dvd is to get kids off their feet and exercising in this day and age of television video games and a joke of physical education in schools it 's up to parents to stress the importance of regular fitness activity diversity is great the children on this dvd consist of both boys and girls ages of about 5 to maybe 12 or 13 years old all sizes from thin to slightly chubby and different nationalities blanks is just a very good instructor and you can see why he 's loved by young and old he motivates the kids and makes the moves entertaining for them even throwing in a couple of old dance moves SMILE billy blanks speaks from the heart and you can tell that he honestly wants everyone to be fit as far as the fitness level i could see kids doing this but it gets a little trickier when you get to the floor exercises if you have n't exercised in a while the good thing about this particular dvd is since it 's geared towards kids billy places less emphasis on getting moves perfect his main focus is to get the kids to realize that exercise is fun overall i think this is a great dvd to add to your collection it 's something you and your kids can enjoy doing together ||| 1
denzel washington plays the legendary steve biko in this 's film while kevin kline plays a top journalist who befriends washington 's character in south africa denzel is my favorite actor and although he does n't get a lot of screen time this is one of his strongest roles ever and you know that 's saying a lot not only does he nail down the african accent but he portray 's biko 's renown concern and persistence this movie was awesome for the first hour i could not take my eyes off it ! as the inevitable came around this point the movie turns to kevin kline 's character who 's trying to escape south africa and spread biko 's story and message it drags on quite extensively the movie is over 2 hours but it still maintains enough to keep it 's rating in my book there were some other flaws like how quickly kline 's character switched from hostility to befriending biko that happened so quickly i could n't tell when they actually saw the film was beautifully shot especially for the 1980 's and i love the scene where biko is speaking at an outdoor stadium being held up by dozens of supporters keep an eye out for joseph marcell geoffry the butler from fresh prince of who has a couple crucial scenes at the end playing a character aptly named 'moses ' the reason this movie was so memorable to me was because it really got me thinking how oppressed black folks have been throughout history sure other movies have depicted this and maybe display this better but sh ! to find out how black people were even kicked aside and discriminated against in south africa was ! i am beginning to understand their frustration as a race and even those in america more and more seeing this movie and being caucasian myself you get a sense of why the black brethren distrust the white man or see him as evil and there 's no propoganda or direct bashing of the white race in this film just depiction i myself kind of feel like a jerk for what my race has done over all these years and believe me we may think this sh t 's resolved and straight today but we got a long ways to go ! you really got ta hand it to denzel he 's tackled some of the biggest black icons so effortlessly not only malcolm x reuben carter among others but steven biko as well he may just be an actor but he must have some strong beliefs in his own race as well to portray legends like these ! it would be great to see him start speaking up for his people and directly to his people a la bill cosby i got this movie off amazon because i could not find it in stores but i recommend searching for it yourself or buying it however you ||| 1
i have heard both arrau and richter playing liszt 's b minor sonata and i am afraid i very much prefer the way yundi li had played this piece perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as arrau 's technique was always not that impressive yundi li is not just a virtuoso you are impressed not only by the shattering way he played for the more emotional part of this piece when liszt was supposed to struggle with his other side of character you will also be impressed by his every subtle nuance for the lyrical part of the music which you seldom hear from others you will also appreciate all the smooth transitions he made from one theme to another will i be able to hear a better and a more logical liszt 's b minor sonata than this i believe yundi li is capable of very deep feeling when he plays you seldom find one pianist more deeply immersed in the music during performance than yundi li music just flow out from his fingers in a most natural way as a result of such deep feeling i particularly agree with this description of yundi li '' what distinguishes this uniquely gifted young artist from most of his contemporaries is his ability to put his personal stamp on a work without resorting even for a single gesture to eccentricity '' although richter was technically more capable compared with arrau i have always found him not expressive enough for pieces that require more rubati you will be impressed by his technique for some beethoven sonata ||| 1
li is no pianist neither is bunin or even zimerman and do n't foeget that chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all and judging from the steam and progess li has made lang lang 's position is certainly under threat and any viewer who is interested in li or how chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this here we have to thank martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the chopin competition now in his and musically out of almost nowhere li is already a full fledged musician of course viewers should not compare him with arrau 's fine balance between the extreme high and rather low register or his scales with richter 's this is not fair for arrau and richter are such great artists li is already so close to zimerman now furthermore what we hear may have more to do with the accoustics of the hall something which has more to do with the engineers than the performer himself and i say so because i 'm a bit concerned about the quality of the picture of this dvd it appears to me more like a vcd than dvd production or somewhere in between it is slightly below average dg production and the camerawork is also average only this is obviously not fair to a blossoming career that li is now having one star is taken for want of a better production ||| 1
i thought beavis and butthead changed america their stupidity was a influence of a generation i sadly was not allowed to watch the show when it was on tv i was a child and in my elementary school years at the time and because i actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode just like the duo themselves they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and i do n't care for music videos i really love the show however like other people who also liked the show i have to agree with them to release all of the episodes for goodness sake ! i ca n't believe they did n't put in the customers suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one i have ever seen when the show was on tv because we want to see and have all of the episodes not just 80 of them and never get to see the other ones i guess this is still recommended but remember we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back even if they have a lost episodes collection i do n't care the people want them and mike judge is refusing to give us them ! ||| 1
this amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability the combination of puppets and live action works really well david bowie is wonderful and all in all it 's a great family film when i gave it to my two granddaughters ages 8 4 they watched it and a little bit scared but then they watched it at least once a day for the next week ||| 1
the professional reviewer missed the main point of jeffrey 's dilemma he 's not so afraid of getting aids he 's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it most people figure a 50 chance of dying before their spouse but taking on a person with a known fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate poignant situation steve weber is no gayer than george bush but he certainly is an enthusiastic kisser this was the first film i saw michael weiss in and he totally had me convinced he was gay i knew patrick stewart is n't but his performance is dead on overall a very funny movie with a big big heart ||| 1
this movie was alright i give it five stars for being artsy quirky it makes gay love look systematically funny and easily made fun of even people with aids deserve a better look at their lives i do not have but have lost friends over it this is a movie for those who either want a good laugh or a good cry i know of nobody who really acts as these characters do i doubt it goes on in new york citys manhattan either purchase this if your just wanting to add to your glbt vhs or dvd collection ||| 1
this dvd was more challenging than i thought but within a few short weeks i can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness recently someone who had not seen me in a while commented that my body looked different so i guess that means the programs really work haha SMILE overall i have been impressed with not only the level of difficulty but also the variety of content and workouts available i easily recommend this dvd ||| 1
i truly love this film and it 's one of my top favorite film of all time the cinematography is absolutely beautiful if you enjoy violence beauitful scenery of brazil a great related story this film is absolutely brillant ||| 1
i first bought the dvd for my mother for christmas she let me borrow it i am glad that i finally watched it it is a truly great movie it is a funny movie and very entertaining i suggest either renting it or buying it ||| 1
i really enjoyed this movie rose mcgowan did a great job as the villianess debbie my favorite line from the movie it 's a family thing '' the movie was in my opinion a black comedy and rose totally looked like trailer trash on her first day of school brilliant ! you should definately watch this movie when you have n't got anything better to do ||| 1
ever wonder where kurtz would 've ended up if he had survived the end of apocalypse now '' well now we know he exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals the horror the horror in light of all the bad press one would really think this is a lousy movie and i can see why some people do n't like it the main portion of the flick is really insane however if you 're a sucker for type yarns and appreciate the heavy mood insanity of apocalypse now '' you 'll probably like it i 'm not saying it 's anywhere near as great as apocalypse now '' but marlon brando and the jungle insanity make the comparison inevitable what works the title sequence is great perhaps one of the best in all of cinema another amazon reviewer noted this so i 'm not alone the soundtrack is phenomenal 'nuff said the plot is intriguing the humanimal is fine 'hyena ' looks especially horrific the film possesses an undeniable creative pizzazz it 's moody atmospheric and insane and marlon brando 's 35 minute stint in the film is as captivating as always you can probably tell i 'm a huge brando fan in particular jacks '' mutiny on the bounty '' 1962 the young lions '' superman '' and apocalypse now '' not redux '' what does n't work the third act of the film is almost total insanity except for the final ten minutes or so as a result the story will lose the interest of those who have no appreciation for such artistic flair closing thoughts i really enjoyed seeing brando in his old age in this flick it proves he had his magnetic charm until the end if you enjoyed brando as 'kurtz ' in apocalypse now '' you 'll appeciate him in island '' in fact as already noted moreau is a variation of kurtz in his old age nutjob in the jungle if you 're predisposed for such a flick moreau '' is weird but certainly worthwhile ||| 1
i bought this dvd because it was listed as an imax title but it is also if you buy the special glasses from the manufacturer regular glasses dont work with this title the quality of the graphics are terrific the plot is a little strange but basically its aliens who invade and ride 4 virtual roller coasters at a futuristic theme park the rides are pretty good and the concept and setting behind each coaster is unique my kids love this dvd and its worth the price ! buy it from the new used section and you can get it for around 3.50 plus shipping ||| 1
casts were chosen by the author hemingway himself that short comment on this film opening was really the miracle particularly gary cooper as american dynamiter roberto and ingrid bergman as hapless young girl maria could happen only through the number of miracles spain in your backyard as the movie opening says shooting took place sonora pass in california not in spain is n't it ironic because sierra nevada mountain range itself was named by spanish reminding them of the homeland mountains when they occupied the part of california bonded by movie deal at that time movie actors were strongly tied by contracts and that prevented both gary cooper and ingrid bergman from the role hemingway wanted on the film to win him the movie company had to pay huge money and maria took it by accicent she even cut her own hair to be maria eventually sacrificing the next movie role deletion of political aspect that is why the movie became successful and became a very entertaining one the movie focus on the love development between maria and roberto which was excellently shown though a bit bergman 's maria was so natural and you can see how far she was into the role but the time provided another politics american hero fighting against dictatorship an ally of nazi and facists that worked far better than any of government sponsored war propaganda i suppose supporting actors and actress supporting actors and actresses did the job quite well particularly i think anselmo was well performed pablo was also nicely acted particularly pablo grinning at the scene of falling snow is truly scary reminding me of jack torrarence of shining pilar is a bit of letdown but not bad the ending i suppect there was alternative version where roberto could survive but the ending place it quite vague old fashioned theatrical ploy i see why butch cassidy and sundance kid ends the similar way the bridge why must an american explode the bridge at the bridge at river kwai the answer might be here real american dynamiter hemingway might have probably heard of the story of american dynamiter somewhere and combined his own self to create the hero robert jordan the good war interviews the model of robert jordan irvin goff it is said maria was created by the image of ingrid bergman verdict very entertaining movie rating 91 out of 100 the presence of ingrid bergman alone contributes 10 point plus recommended for any of classic movie fans ||| 1
i never bought the vhs tape but when i was notified this would be coming out on dvd i ordered it while i 'm not an amateur i am a professional eric is a guitarist 's guitarist anyone who thinks he do n't need learnin ' is a fool and only famous in his own little world small as it may be i 'm not that arrogant as danny gatton was known as the humbler eric johnson could rightly be called the inspiration what he does is not so much difficult as it is the epitome of finesse and transparency of technique after viewing this you will understand what i mean i already know much of what eric teaches in this session for that is what it is a private session much like you might get at git with a master at the top of his craft but there is always something to learn even after repeated viewings i even scanned in the booklet that comes with this so i can break the lessons down and blow up the individual charts for more easy reading if you are serious about improving as a player and if you 're looking to be a real professional you need to get this if only to see what true professionalism looks and sounds like the lessons are clear and focused and with the booklet and the new ability to slow down the examples you really can learn to play these things but do n't expect to sound like eric just as those who tried to but could never sound like jimi hendrix you are different and so will always sound different and that 's a plus but the techniques and all that are included here are part of a must learn '' program you need to create and follow if you want to at least make a good living playing music learn from a master of melody and technique where technique does n't get in the way of the melody but lives in service to the song the way it should be i teach too and i recommend to any student who wants to grow that they should get this dvd if you get no other this would serve whatever style you choose to pursue ultimately because there is so much here that can be applied to virtually any style whether it is jazz country blues rock or even acoustic which i wish he would have included a segment on that my only kvetch ||| 1
sea of love is certainly a better than average steamy crime thriller but it did n't really bowl me over pacino 's very good of course and ellen barkin more than holds her own against him but pacino 's character can become tiresome after a while and what i regard as a pretty sizeable red herring thrown into your lap midway through the story makes the ending a little less dramatic i 'm not saying the mystery is predictable it 's just not that shocking of a surprise frank keller al pacino is n't exactly steve mcgarrett material when it comes to his career as a detective mainly because the guy is basically pretty pathetic his wife left him for another detective on the force and he 's not handling that very well drunken calls in the middle of the night to his are not uncommon the guy drinks like a fish all day and all night whether he 's on duty or not he gets into serious shoving matches with other cops and he spends more time getting under the skin of his fellow detective and 's new man than investigating the crime at the scene of the film 's opening murder later on he gets into a serious relationship with one of the murder suspects which has to break a lot of rules in the old code of conduct about all he gleans from the first murder is the fact that someone plugged a fat naked guy in the back of his head and that the killer was apparently a big fan of the song sea of love fortunately for him a queens detective played by john goodman working on a similar case teams up with him on a task force to find the mutual killer the common thread linking the murders together is the fact that each victim had recently placed a poetic personal ad in the newspaper since no one seems to have bothered looking at any of the evidence too closely keller and detective sherman goodman decide to place a similar ad in the paper meet all of the women who respond get their prints and compare them with those found at the murder scenes and break the case wide open keller meets helen ellen barkin at one of these undercover dates she blows him off early on before she even comes close to leaving a fingerprint on anything when they meet accidentally soon thereafter though a spark is lit and the two are lovers before you can say jack sprat frank puts his feelings for helen above his job thereby leaving helen hanging out there as a possible murder suspect this is where all of the suspense comes in is she or is n't she the story zigs and zags both ways on the question leaving the viewer in a measure of doubt until the very end the whole thing turns into a weird love story for the most part with frank trying to avoid losing helen even as he sometimes wonders whether she 's the killer he 's looking for it is quite suspenseful largely thanks to ellen barkin 's very strong performance the ultimate ending 's a little weak but that takes nothing at all away from the sustained mystery that will command your rapt attention all the way up to that point it 's not hard to see why the movie was so successful it just goes to show what good acting and a reasonably strong script can do for a movie there are probably two camps when it comes to the ending i should note but it 's not a hate it or love it thing some will not find it all that surprising while others may feel as if it comes right out of left field either way sea of love is a film that all fans of steamy thrillers can lose themselves in and at the very least come out feeling reasonably satisfied ||| 1
film noir at it 's best lies betrayal deception sexual eroticism all through the movie you dont know who to cheer for the cop the dirty teacher the trailer trash chic the funny lawyer the school tramp the tramp 's mother the cop 's partner the tramp 's mother cuban lover you dont know who is who and what is up or down one big dirty camp of a describe it with only one word it would be yummy ||| 1
there are so many reasons to like wild things '' it 's easy to call this movie perfect although it 's not the best movie ever made or even in the top 20 for that matter it truly is a perfect movie for what it could 've been i borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity well this movie does have a plot and it 's quite complicated some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes but you ca n't argue that this is a damned good movie matt dillon stars as sam lombardo a guidance counselor at blue bay high school lombardo is a lady 's man in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he 's done half of blue bay well lombardo has a student named kelly van ryan denise richards who i 've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie who seems to be coming onto him lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in blue bay well one day kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash lombardo 's car for the senior car wash and then we see kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face then kelly says lombardo raped her lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer bill murray well then another girl named suzie toller neve campbell says lombardo raped her as well another player in the plot is ray duquette kevin bacon the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories now this movie is one of those films where you think you know what 's going on and then they throw a wild card after that you think you know what 's going on again and then happens even when the movie ends you do n't know the full story until the credit sequence the sex scenes the most famous with denise richards matt dillon and neve campebell are quite nice but surprisingly the movie would be good without them this is a really great movie and worth the 5 bucks it would cost to buy it ||| 1
first off i agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie when denise richards sees matt dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like is this just a game for the boys or can anyone play '' she looks so sweet and hot that it 's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later however she pulls ift off pretty well in fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well i could n't understand why kevin bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual but that was actually pretty good acting ca n't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists but it 's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing i give it 5 stars because it 's both fun and funny and of course very hot at times well worth a look ||| 1
this movie looks simply amazing ! the color texture and detail provided by are superb this is a showcase title for the format first a word about my setup which is nice but far from optimal the player is connected via hdmi to a sanyo projector with an approximately 140 '' picture thrown onto a light beige wall the room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado 's but my family and i thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it now about the title there are no compression artifacts or mosquito noise to be found anywhere none i also bought this title on and have watched on an upscaling dvd player both on a 57 '' crt bigscreen and the projector and there are a distracting number of the aforementioned artifacts and mosquito noise in both cases they 're most noticeable on large surface solid colors of which there are many in this movie you 'll see them dance '' and shimmer on not so on the colors are bold and bright when appropriate but what really struck me while watching the title were the drabbish gray scenes such as the streets of the town with the factory looming in the background you can make out more detail without any obvious edge enhancement problems found in the original version the lights from the townsfolk dwellings were suffused with a soft glow in this latest version not a ringed mess the story itself is not necessarily an improvement over the original rather its told from a slightly different perspective giving more insight into willie wonka 's character and updating the other kids violet mike teavee etc to reflect a newer generation of youngsters mike feels a bit weak he 's portrayed as a videogame crazed violent kid in the sequence that introduces his character then sort of disappears into the background the rest of the movie veruca and violet by contrast are more prominently featured and you 'll develop more antipathy towards their characters by their actions throughout the movie augustus also suffers a bit but since he 's the first to get ousted from the party it 's logical that he wo n't be as fully developed as a character his romp through the initial scene whilst in the factory is pretty good however overall i 'd give this 5 stars not only as a visual and audible feast for owners but felt the movie was a great update to the original and stands on its own merits even in presentation ||| 1
an extraordinary film the vanishing brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the american northwest the movie falls into the type of category kiefer sutherland jeff bridges nancy travis sandra bullock and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! very well written and very well presented it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again ! the setting the plot jeff 's strong sense of love devotion and determination are admirable and commendable and an example for all to follow ! the dialogues and the music are all wonderful ! in short the vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection ! ||| 1
a great reality show following a group of working class youths in england getting the chance to become cooks in a top uk restaurant for free it 's highly entertaining and well worth the price we caught this show when we were visiting australia and got hooked also check out jamie 's school dinners series available on amazon uk ||| 1
i really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc i have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length the movie is about a giant gorilla ! it is a fantasy film kids ! the original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well i think the remake is incredible it better than the original in some ways yes ! in some ways no ! thats the way it goes ! i still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! i wish peter jackson would try to remake son of kong into as good a movie if he can pull that off SMILE ||| 1
the premier american cinematic drama is the western and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns this set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side there are n't any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections it 's true that the majority of these are and some are unintentionally hilarious to view today there are some definite classics mcclintock under california stars along with plenty of simply enjoyable films just a note there are a few mistakes for example the santa fe trail '' included on this set is the 1930 richard arlen version it 's the errol flynn olivia haviland version which i personally feel is superior anyway also some films were taken either directly from television you 'll see a in stereo flash across the screen when you play the film or did n't transfer very well slight distortions in video or audio but considering the age of these movies and the cheap price tag this is an amazing deal ! ||| 1
the first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of usmc boot camp i have ever seen outside of actually being there i 've read that lee emery who played the senior drill instructor was initially hired to coach other actors for the role but he did such a perfect job himself that stanley kubrick hired him for the job if the film had ended after the first half alone it would have been phenomenal the second half of the film portrays the same boot camp marines from the first half who are now in viet nam the tone and the setting are much different as the men engage in a number of battle situations including a fairly gruesome scene with a female sniper where the first half of this film is almost comical at times the second half is much more serious and grave overall this is a serious and engaging movie that brilliantly describes military experiences on and off the battlefield ||| 1
i enjoyed the movie very much since i love the idea of knights and castles during the middle ages and as merrick says when men still had honor i wanted to join them just for the excitement and the chance of a lifetime besides i 'm a sap for a great looking guy saving his damsel in distress at all costs even if it mea n't changing history i liked that they portayed lady clair as a tough stand up to the bad guy do what needed to be done spy for her brother to win the battle kinda lady ||| 1

ok i understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters they are the traditional mars '' and venus '' symbols representing masculinity and femininity i also understand the last symbol representing infinity '' a loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever or maybe the propagation of eternal life '' by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity but what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values the star of david representing judaism and a cross representing christianity i have n't seen the movie in years but i do n't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot please also forward your thoughts to vboston at ||| 1
three stooges meet waiting for godot '' lurie waits and benigni turn in great performances they 've been locked up in a lousiana penitentiary for being in the wrong place at the wrong time jarmusch gives you each of their sordid lives in turn before throwing them together in a jail cell benigni plays wonderfully off lurie and waits culminating in a hilarious version of i scream you scream we all scream for ice scream '' eventually they find the light at the end of a tunnel only to have to escape through a swamp jarmusch gives his characters plenty of room making for many amusing interchanges jarmusch provides deft camera work and his usual wonderful eye for detail to make this his most memorable film ||| 1
okay how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants unless you were one of the misery causing you did n't this movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena but takes a good crackshot at the mothers kirstie alley 's character is a real gem ! it also makes fun of the people in minnesota i see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film but heard the term midwest '' used far more often we feel your pain but i would have laughed had they picked my state which is very close to mn they poke fun at hunters lutherans yes i 'm one and lutefisk for lunch in high school i 'm also of norwegian decent the most fun to be had is the way this movie spoofs how nasty women can be regardless of class warfare and what lengths some of them will go to just to get their way funny and like the nailhead beneath a hammer this movie is a nasty and fun treat for everyone who has ever been treated badly by the local uppercrust enjoy 100 minutes of vengeance and then go out into the world feeling better about the fact that you 're definitely not alone ! ||| 1
art history has always been an interest of mine and i 'm a big fan of other art movies such as girl with a pearl earing '' and merchant of venice '' so when i found out about modigliani i was happy to take the time to go watch it not only was it worth my time but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion was n't looked fondly on everything about the movie is amazing from the sets to the acting i feel this is one of andy garcia 's best films in some time not only is he convincing but he fits the part of modigliani better than any other actor could they focused the movie around his rivalry with picasso which i find to be one of the most interesting things about it you do n't only get an insight into one artist but many you see the life the artists were living and the obstacles they had to overcome to get their art out into the world modigliani also had a tragic romance with a young catholic girl who 's father did n't want her with the struggling painter the story is the perfect depiction of the religious standards in that time period overall this was a great movie and i would strongly suggest that you take the time to check it out you wo n't regret it it 's probably one of the best movies of the year ||| 1
i have both madonna grimes workouts dvd 's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts it was a great way to start my day i was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same but with disapointment comes satisfaction the other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts and learn a workout that i never thought that i would learn and enjoy doing jayna 's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning also great moves you can use for other reasons rania 's upper body is really fun some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot suhaila workout i am intimidated by i have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it i have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks she can contract them one at a time some mornings i get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape they are really fun this tape has a bonus yoga i had never tried yoga and this gave me an opportunity to try it i highly recommeded this i love the 10 minute workouts with this there are no excuses you can always find 10 minutes in a day ||| 1

i just finished watching when harry met sally for probably the tenth time it 's been years since i 've seen it and i enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend i could n't get over the fact that i still laughed several times almost as if i 'd never seen the movie before my interpretation after all these years was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments infatuation etc without stooping to sugary sentiment i took harry and sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable i did n't see them as somehow representative of all men '' or all women '' then i watched the extra documentary on the dvd which i had never seen until now big mistake my new interpretation '' of the film was suddenly cast aside as i remembered that i actually did n't like this movie as much when it first came out over time i had grown to accept the fact that i could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved what i had forgotten was billy crystal 's rob reiner 's director and nora ephron 's writer agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders gag the views of the characters are presented as if they were fact men supposedly always think about sex and ca n't be friends with women most if not all women have faked an orgasm all men are clueless to the fakery and so on i can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the boomer generation and older folks no one on this film is even close being a member of gen x because this does not represent the reality of all humans you 'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to prove '' their case if they 'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it no i wo n't fake it if he sucks in bed i 'm going to tell him '' and as for men some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it none of this changes this classic film that 's the great thing about art it 's open to interpretation i can watch this film and define it my way two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love otherwise i 'd hate this movie but i wo n't give reinder ephron et al that much power just because they were narrow minded about gender roles does n't mean i have to be about their film if you agree with the characters in the film by all means watch the documentary but if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters pass it by do n't let a dvd extra taint your pov ||| 1
the movie was great ! ! but they left a few things out in the movie that were in the book ! ! there were more siblings in the book but this is still a must see and must read ! ||| 1
love the book could n't wait for the movie and was not disappointed ! i have watched it many times and enjoy it each time the story was so involved and the movie just about captured every event which is why it took two dvds or 3 cds yes i have both to show the entire story a great way to spend a cold winter day ||| 1
this is one of the best photography documentary i have ever seen i love photojournalism and this is as good as it gets i love the story narration that this dvd succeeds in james nachtwey is the greatest ever to have photographed all the atrocities up close and personal you can feel the pain agony and raw human emotion in his photographs he is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger it needs guts and commitment to do a job which has constant fear of getting killed i salute you nachtwey you inspire me uday ||| 1

great movie ! make it part of your collection good story beautiful video and great sound turn your volume up on the and you will feel the power ! ||| 1
this movie is a real departure for the director akira kurosawa in that it blends his humanistic movies like ikiru '' with a bit of action and drama yojimbo sanjuro '' the majority of the movie follows a young and arrogant doctor forced to work in a rural and poor region of japan under a domineering senior doctor naturally everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour midway through the movie out of nowhere one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission it is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief confusing and brutal toshiro mifune and kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director 's work changed radically still good but i 'll always prefer the b w epics the two of them made together ||| 1
ahh remincing about the old days of youth this dvd is great for the young and the old comedy that surpasses all generation its a great gift ||| 1
i bought this only because i loved the first one hoping it was n't as terrible as the second after i watched it i was so impressed first of all i loved that it really did n't have anything to do with the first aside from cassidy being katherine 's cousin and sharing the same last name there is only one reference to katherine and sebastian in the beginning it is much better than having different actors playing old characters which drags a movie down alot i thought the story was great with good whole cast is very attractive which ca n't hurt either the bad '' characters are all pretty likeable aside from one and all is well in the end the best thing about this movie is the character cassidy i sarted out hating her and ended up really liking her for her realness and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a this actress does a particularly good job pulling off both loveable and complete brat at the same time i would definetly reccomend this movie ||| 1
goal ! is a soccer version of the road to glory in athletics it is a true cinderella story that makes the impossible possible and fulfills the one in a million shot at stardom the soccer player a young hispanic man in los angeles gets a chance to tryout for english premier league power newcastle as the movie progresses more and more people believe in the young man 's dream his family relationships are present and in the movie as is a budding romance we see the young player learn about the consequences of his decisions there are enough conflicts and challenges in this movie that keep it interesting the soccer presented in the movie is very we see actual professional players make cameo 's on and off the headbutts though a few times i felt like i was watching an actual english premier league game there are just a few too many spin moves over the ball but they look cool this is a good movie with a good begining and good ending i am glad i watched it and recommend it especially to soccer fans ||| 1
i ca n't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars i do n't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews but this is certainly not a bad movie i was in grade when it came out and i remember how popular it was back then everyone and i mean everyone loved it no one said they did n't like it even my dad to this day says he would n't mind watching the movie a few more times and he never wants to watch a movie more than two times the actors the direction the story everything about this movie worked it 's a movie that will remain a classic forever there 's something here for everyone ||| 1
this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out an excellent and energetic movie from the start plot is cutesy it serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences however i think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes i would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me if memory serves me did n't alex receive a letter from her friend hannah when alex discovered hannah passed away is n't there a reconnection at the end between mickey and alex 's girl friend whom the latter was dating was n't there more of a story between alex and her boss if this version is cut in anyway i prefer getting the complete and unedited version i find this version incomplete somehow but jennifer beals looks terrific and one wonders why she did n't star in more movies for her generation ||| 1
now this is a rock n ' roll show from rock 's good guys '' pearl jam is probably the most important band ever in american music they are to the us what led zeppelin was to britain this concert is a fantastic representation of their mature shows no you wo n't see a lot of or moshing any more from these 30 and 40 somethings just a lot of great music and wonderful lyrics mike mccready is quite possibly one of the world 's most underrated soulful guitarists and his playing just sounds even better when you can see what those fingers are doing at first i was not a fan of adding boom gaspar to the shows but i have come to quite enjoy his contributions and pretty much consider him a bona fide member of the band as i do matt cameron who filled in a revolving throne '' back when jack irons left due to back problems after yield '' there are some true gems on this recording and the concert goes on and on with lots of music and a nice long encore the crowd is in the thing from the beginning and the band is on '' and every member is in their 'zone ' and seems to be having a fantastic time only cameron true to form seems a bit stoic '' highlights of this dvd are lukin '' black '' thumbing my way '' last exit '' and save you '' however the band just goes to a heavenly plane with low light '' faithful '' and in my tree '' there ai n't much from versus and 10 on this one with the band more oriented towards their more organic '' '' and vibey '' feel which has turned off some of the hard rocking '' pj fans however if you listen back pj has always had the pensive laid back rockers even in the explosive days of the early 90 's with songs like black '' daughter '' alive '' oceans '' and the like just because the band has chosen to explore other instruments and rhythms and to mature as a complete organism has caused some to reject them because they do n't rock hard enough '' and that is ridiculous as one will see on these dvd 's this is the best representation of pj 's wonderful live shows on official '' record ben harper makes a wonderful appearance or two as does tony barber the bass player for the buzzcocks who is forever immortalized on dvd for not knowing the bassline for sonic reducer '' overall the performance is just about as tight as a live performance gets and the camera angles and picture quality is pretty good most of the time the extras are good but ed 's solo guitar version of dead man '' stands out as a heartfelt amazing performance down '' an underrated song from the record lost dogs '' is merely a backdrop for some footage which is fine but i 'd much rather hear what the boys are saying and see a live performance of the song if you 're a fan of rock and roll or pearl jam you already own this dvd if you 're just now waking up from your coma then get this now ! study it learn the methods of pj and you too can become the best band in america ! boys who only know even flow '' and alive '' need not ||| 1

this is a fascinating look at the journey through the first 5 books of the bible it 's a visual foundation for stories that all three major religions the jews the christians and the muslims hold sacred to their faith and their traditions as a documentary the journey takes place today '' in the midst of the struggles and misunderstandings that make it realistic and for our faith today if you want to understand the bible this is an amazing way to see the stories that most people of the world hold as sacred to their beliefs and faith ||| 1

while roman polanski was avoiding authories in america in 1988 he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller it stars harrison ford in a rather unique role that of a doctor an every man type such as jimmy stewart in the man who knew too much '' without the indiana jones hype although filmed 18 years ago it seems more contemporary that ever a fine thriller that even hitch would approve ! what is not contemporary is the fact that we consumers here in region 1 north america that 's right canada too get nothing but junk garbage from the releasing studios lousy grainy transfers in the edited pan scan format not fit for anything but a 7 '' dvd personal viewer maybe ! why is this and most any other movie presented in it 's original aspect ratio available in region 2 europe but not on this side of the pond disney is by far the major offender in this area but hey what say you warner it was always thought that the mighty oceans would protect us from our enemies both foreign and domestic proved that wrong and i guess nobody though of hollywood as a band of american home video terrorists a silly statement but ever so true ! this region 1 dvd release of frantic '' says it all ||| 1

after much debate i decided to view this film with an open mind the performances are outstanding i really liked the music composition as it flowed gently with the story in a way i 'm glad this film didnt't win best picture '' for one reason the scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch maybe its too perfect later on we find out it 's not wyoming but it alberta canada take a star away ! overall this is a movie that will advance gay right in the united states for those who do n't like it the train has left the station ! ||| 1

the documentary was really really good they left some stuff out of it of course but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense one thing i did not remember was the prodigious mullet brian sported back in the day man i think that thing was more impressive than jagr 's mullet of the ! i do n't know that i learned anything new from the documentary but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing also stone cold talking about the hollywood blonds tag team was great fun they really played up the flyin ' brian stuff as being ahead of it 's time which it was and the loose cannon character that had everyone guessing funny thing is that the whole loose cannon thing was n't really if you think about it the gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill the accident was glossed over he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his 's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not he knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him anyhoo the official coroner 's report was that he had a heart attack just as his dad had at a young age of course the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over i mean the wwe is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a ahem sports entertainer '' is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job it 's the whole argument on a human scale the truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in best parts were reliving the hollywood blonds stuff i remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and steve were going to be huge stars steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in wcw they never name the booker but i am 90 sure that it was ric flair back then who headed the booking committee i am also 80 sure that arn was on the committee too they must have felt threatened by the flare for the old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a tbs special in i am guessing 1992 or 1993. great stuff though and brian came up with the whole gimmick they were so hilarious together another great part was jim ross talking about how he believed that he had become a to brian in the wwf that was sad stuff jr really had a hard time trying to help brian but pillman only saw the fact that jr order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal overall i am going with 4 crutches out of 5. i have n't watched any of the matches as yet but i am less interested in that kind of thing than i am the documentaries ||| 1

pretty woman anniversary special edition has to be considered one of the most classical romantic comedies made throughout the years julia roberts and richard gere are excellent actors together and without them i do n't believe the movie would have been the same this classic fairy tale '' movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest this is not your typical romantic movie and i believe that is why so many people love this movie pretty woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there the anniversary special edition also brought some scenes deleted scenes and commentary the deleted scenes are also a must watch they are just simply hilarious and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies but who also likes added comedy as well pretty woman is definitely one of the greatest films ever made ||| 1

over the years people have grown tired of natural disaster movies why because they all appear to be the same here 's an example of a typical everything starts out nice and calm the story focuses on one family the family starts having problems and they split up and then a volcano tornado hurricane or whatever hits and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger just so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie well that kind of typical storyline is n't featured here twister is truly a classic it 's not ordinary either it 's about a group of tornado chasers who as you guessed drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get film of a twister up close and personal this means the film delivers the most amazing action i have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films and i remember in 1996 how influential this movie was i was in grade and the science teacher played twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was so good and much better than other tornado films helen hunt plays a magnificent role she is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she 's going through what 's great about this is that despite giving us a really good story about a divorce this does n't interfere with all the tornado action there are many good scenes in twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it 's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie favorite scenes well everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air so i wo n't pick that one i really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it that 's just one of many awesome scenes the storyline is really good too it 's not just a story about a divorce between helen and her husband there 's a lot more to it than that it 's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action against her will this is such an awesome movie i highly recommend it tornado movies do n't get any better than this pure action from beginning to end you will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger twister will make you think twice if you 're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser ||| 1
personally i really enjoyed premonition it 's got solid acting a fascinating and often story and some decent scares however do n't expect an all out fright fest or you 'll be sorely disappointed this is a film with a plot that progresses fairly slowly patience is necessary when viewing premonition as is a willingness to accept ambiguity and logic in a film but for those of you who possess those qualities and are looking for something a little different particularly if you 're a fan of the genre premonition might be for you ||| 1
this movie is fantastic ! it is defo on my fav list one of the best ! ||| 1
setting theme s castlerock smallville summer friends ' adventure life 's lessons solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown this 1986 instant classic of rob reiner 's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film the musical score is dramatic it sets the tempo from start to finish and it never misses a beat each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie 's unfolding and you do n't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding the lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient lazy summer days of grandeur to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity one can in stand by me favorably assume to watch pie eating contests leeches trains train dodging mail ball fancy cars fancy footwork verno 's beloved comb 's freefall cantenes thought they disappeared ben franklin 's outlets junkyard dog chases and much much more the ending is the real gravy the narration is superb also by far one of the favorite films of my youth believe john cusack can be seen playing the role of gordy 's football star elder brother stand by me is the childhood that big city life just does n't afford at least not anymore everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses rustic destination spots like the ones presented in this movie are still out there folks with a smidgen of ambition toward adventure which will take your there the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors five stars for reiners finest photoplay ||| 1

half light is a movie my wife would like if i can convince her that it 's not too scary for her she is the most timid of movie goers and refuses to watch horror movies with me but half light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense there are some scares but at the most tepid edge of today 's horror the movie is much more about the grief of a mother have the kleenex box close by and has a big love story with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse ugh in the middle of it just the kind of thing my wife might like when she 's willing to see something on her scary side unfortunately for me this is not my kind of movie at all even so it was well made it was well acted the english locations were impressively beautiful the story was interesting and had a good plot twist at the end ah what the heck i guess i liked it after all ||| 1

csi miami having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons reaches its high point in season 3. anyone who has watched the show realizes that horatio unlike gil grissom or mac taylor is the true star of the show the rest of the csis are entertaining but the show is truly about him this dynamic when combined with the glamour and glitz of the miami setting and crimes most foul make this for me the csi that is above the rest plotwise season 3 is bit over the top issues covered in this season include a stalker murder a sports star on trial for his wife 's murder a young woman killed in a club the murder of a uniformed cop gang warfare in a hospital the killings of irs agents speed dating that ends in a death spree killing and the murder of a wingwoman some of the lesser episodes involve our old friend clavo cruz a giant boa contricter that eats a woman skaters and gamers and of course the infamous tsunami episode the season incorporates the raymond caine subplot heavily in the last 5 or 6 episodes this leads up to a satisfying conclusion in the season finale the season is also one of change a regular cast member gets killed in episode 1 which quite frankly was quite a relief since the character was terrible another regular not a csi kills himself a new cast member joins officer ryan wolfe makes the transfer from patrol to csi and making some waves in the process callie and delco who has very little to do this season have a tough time dealing with tragedy and we actually see horatio dating a rather attractive assistant da at least for a few episodes some old familiars pop by including suzy and madison and raymond caine 's killer bob who ends up being much more important in the story than we assumed all in all it adds up to a great season which will be extremely difficult to top in season 4. people either love or hate this show so if you count yourself among the fans this is a must addition to the collection corwin m ||| 1

rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence teenage angst sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from alexander payne reese witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range matthew broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for witherspoon 's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality in his screen debut chris klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against witherspoon and jessica campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty one of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election reese prays to an unfamiliar god and beseeches him to let her win so she can carry out his divine plan '' campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to while goofy klein shows the most depth by thanking god for all of his blessings especially his large penis and telling god he knows the best candidate will win election is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind enjoy ||| 1

what i enjoy most about this movie is not what i particularly enjoyed when it first came out being 11 when it came out i was attracted to the urbanism of which i was not too familiar with i did n't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood but it was no inglewood either i think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film the urban youth seeing for the first time thier lives on a film of this caliber and the suburban youth somehow glorifying this life while i still enjoy the entire film what i particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film the story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders ca n't be tamed by her she sends him to live with his father who is in many ways her equal but he is a man and one of her lines in the movie is i ca n't teach him how to be a man that 's your job '' how true this is not to sound sexist because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother because of an abusive father etc but you need a man to teach you to be a man larry fishburne 's charachter in this movie does this perfectly one quote i know you think i 'm being hard on you tre but i 'm not what i 'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility your friends across the street do n't have anyone to do that your'e gon na see how they end up too '' i loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents while divorced raise their son the way they know best and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal i 'd have to say that my favorite character is furious yes reva tre 's mom played an equally strong part but i loved how real '' furious was young '' tre i thought played an excellent part better than gooding maybe overall a great movie it 's success made it harder for corporate america to ignore the reality of youth as it exists today ||| 1
a great suspense movie with terrific slow adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy brian de palma does a super many called it a ripoff '' with this film and the widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on tapes the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by a dennis franz who has hair here ! the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it 's apparent who the killer is it 's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women ||| 1
strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb '' is of the films that are considered stanley kubrick 's masterpieces the other two are 2001 a space odyssey a clockwork orange it 's a satire released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today whenever you look at a list of great movies it 's on there it holds a place on the american film institute 's top 100 26 the american film institute 's top 100 comedies 3 is featured in roger ebert 's the great movies '' and is just overall acknowledged as a fine piece of cinema the movie opens with general jack ripper sterling hayden launching an unauthorized nuclear attack against russia the general is clearly mad and believes that the russians are polluting everyone 's valuable bodily fluids the only person who can stop ripper is captain mandrake peter sellers a british guy who listens to ripper 's ranting in disbelief meanwhile at the pentagon the president of the united states president muffley peter sellers again assembles a meeting in the war room where he is told hesitantly by general buck turgidson george scott that the bombers can not be recalled no one can reach ripper etc in one of the most hilarious characters i 've ever seen portrayed on screen we meet strangelove peter sellers yet again a strategist aiding the people in the war room strangelove 's right hand covered in a black glove has a mind of its own it frequently throws up nazi salutes and tries to kill strangelove also happening in the story is one of the planes heading to russia to drop the bomb the ruler of the cockpit is major king '' kong slim pickens a character that was supposed to be played by sellers but reportedly could n't because sellers had recently suffered a broken angle the scene where kong rides a nuclear bomb as if he was riding a bull is one of the scenes in the movie that you 're not likely to forget now this is a funny and important film but it 's not my favorite kubrick film nor is it the most entertaining kubrick film but due to it 's significance and the performances by sellers hayden and especially scott it definitely deserves the term masterpiece '' entertainment b humor importance a overall grade ||| 1
this black and white masterwork of film is a must see for all this is a not just a courtroom movie but an examination of ourselves and how we see each other reginald rose 's original play reads like a powerhouse even in a highschool english class but given the direction of sidney lumet the dynamite cast and the beautifully stark black and white cinematography it becomes a legend on film this movie centers on the diverse jury and it 's deliberations in the murder trial of a young puerto rican man accused of killing his own father it is an examination of our perception of one another our selfish nature our apathy when a crisis does not affect us and our preconceived ideas of each other not based not upon fact but upon our own experiences and traumas it sheds light on how we process our decisions and how we can be easily yet unknowingly swayed away from the truth and yet believe we make honest and fair evaluations of fact when in all truth we do not this was the only film in which henry fonda starred and was the producer and it was slow to take off at the box office but within a few years this film became an american film mainstay regardless of the stunning performances and positive reviews he never produced again this film has many of the early television and film greats and each gives a riveting performance ! ! ! there 's jack klugman martin balsam john fiedler marshall and lee cobb who gives one of the most memorable performances in the film cobb who was known for his moving portrayal of willie loman in death of a salesman is aggravating and compelling fonda depicts the voice of reason '' juror that is neither or wimpy he challenges the other jurors and the viewer alike to rethink their conclusions and recalculate them by utilizing all the facts anyone that sees this movie will recognize at least someone they know that is like each juror which are designated only by number throughout it 's entirety in their daily lives do n't let the black and white format sway you this dvd is presented in a lovely widescreen format that intensifies the expert cinematic talents of the golden age of the silver screen this is considered an essential for anyone that loves film my thirteen year old actually sat mesmerized through the whole film and began to watch some of my other dvds to kill a mockingbird inherit the wind judgement at nuremburg to name a few and at that tender young age he is determined to spread the word and keep the tradition of sharing these movies of great metaldiva sez this is one of the essential films you should watch and share with your friends and family this is an excellent price to own and to share get it today ||| 1

i have n't watched the first season i just started watching the show so i 'm a very brand new viewer but i 've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show its subject matter is grim yes but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry especially david boreanaz buffy the vampire slayer angel and emily deschanel the stories are interesting being too scientific so anyone can follow along and i never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone 's bones okay maybe only in tv land ||| 1
scholl die letzten tage ' scholl the final days ' follows the last six days of the life of sophie scholl member of white rose ' small organization that protested against hitler through the method in the munich her life had been filmed in germany twice before white rose ' by michael verhoeven and five last days ' by percy adlon both in 1982. unfortunately i have n't seen them but the fact proves that this organization during the wwii in germany some part of which still remain mystery has been always a very fascinating topic in that country now using the unpublished materials that were unavailable then german director marc rothemund made another film based on this important episode in the german history this time he gives stress to the realistic description of the last six days of sophie scholl a college student who was arrested with her brother during the political activities against the nazi in 1943. actually sophie was only posting and scattering the fliers in college campus but that was enough for the nazi at first however they were not sure sophie is just an ordinary student and the nazi interrogator robert mohr was not convinced the film spends considerable time in depicting the dialogues between sophie scholl and robert mohr and the rising tension between two characters supported by historical material and strong acting is one of the most impressive parts of the film consequently the film becomes a bit talky sometimes but both julia jentsch edukators ' and gerald alexander held did a fantastic job as two realistic persons with souls without making them too saintly or monstrous if you 're looking for the facts about the white rose itself you may be disappointed the behaviors of sophie and hans her brother before their arrest by the police look incredibly reckless far from that of organized resistance the film would not tell you much about what the group was really doing before they were caught because it is about the spiritual transformation of sophie scholl i do n't know anything about the historical accuracy of the film but it is clear that the filmmakers took great care to present the most accurate portrait of sophie scholl see the detailed procedures of the court for example because of that the film sometimes gets slower than it should be but still the powerful acting from the actors are as fascinating as this historical event itself but the strongest or i should say the most shocking part of the film is waiting for you at the end of the film one image still haunts my mind which i ca n't tell you of course but all i can say is prepare for one sequence that is more unnerving and disturbing any suspense or horror films like ' another gripping german film about the nazi scholl die letzten tage ' gives you a realistic image of a human during the war and this is a story about one person that lived an extraordinary life ||| 1

we own three baby faith dvd 's our favorite is god made music '' followed by god made me '' god made animals '' while still a good video is our least favorite for one the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing but judge for yourself i 've posted some pictures the frog was creepy since when do frogs have lips the visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too and the undersea clips at the end looked as old as cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one son who is entranced by the other two videos but does n't seem to care much for this one my suggestion watch before you buy if you can if your kid likes it go for it if not try the other videos you may get a different reaction ||| 1

i 'm not a big fan of tom or demi and jack even wears out his welcome in some films but not here the supporting roles are superbly done the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end and when this shows up on cable tv i almost always watch it again for a or so here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict and that reflects a lot of real life in the usa during the past four years i enjoy the script because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force ||| 1
i have been a fan of csi since the first season has come out i am an avid collector of dvds and i 'm way behind i 'm on another show right now as we speak anyway i love the sound and the special features are always low but i do n't mind that there is just one thing that i did not like part of the cover case on my season four dvd came off it still fits into my dvd collection and i obviously wo n't buy another copy because the dvd 's are working fine but the plastic may come into a problem ||| 1

could n't believe that this was the same john lithgow who starred in third rock from the sun '' an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on nbc john plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by denzel 's character was n't expecting much but this movie was surprisingly entertaining yes it was a little violent and some parts were a tad unbelievable but overall denzel and john were worthy antagonists boy denzel sure was gorgeous ! ! still is ||| 1
a movie such as this in the german language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic furthermore the actors who play the key roles especially hitler but also goebbels speer himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie what sets the film apart from other films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings not stereotypical hollywood caricatures what makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine furthermore the the director avoids melodrama the events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of berlin as good as schindler 's list and saving private ryan were this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and this is a milestone in wwii genre of ||| 1
i became interested in this movie after reading the book ishmael '' by daniel quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book it was a very good movie and anthony hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from ishmael '' there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization there was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization takers '' are mentioned but it comes across more as you just do n't know what you are missing by being one not that all of nature has had it heck the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees but of course that was the main point of ishmael '' if we do n't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature then nature has had it and so have we ||| 1
this is a good cold war drama after a soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place the race is on to recapture the film as was pointed out in the film the soviets used their german scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from england 's german scientists using a special film developed by the us 's german scientists the film has the location of both side 's missile installations and both sides want it neither side will give an inch the chase takes place with a us nuclear sub overcrowded by marines and spies the problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission the twists and turns do n't stop and neither does the excitement the film is dated but still a good show the photography especially is spectacular especially for that day and age rock hudson leads an all star cast which does a great job across the board ||| 1
i had to replace my video with this dvd version this movie is spectacular beautiful photography excellent acting and most importantly a tremendous comment on the social restrictions placed on women of the time it is based on the true life of one of the first commissioned female artists in europe artemesia whose father is an artist is forbidden to draw or paint the human body her efforts to do so lead her into difficulties her father is supportive but even he must fight the social structure especially when trying to get her into the art school he finally gets her apprenticed to another talented artist and is devastated when he finds they have engaged in an unlawful '' relationship he files rape charges and everyone suffers a brilliant social commentary ||| 1
before i saw this sequel i had heard and read that it was a terrible film however be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it 's not as good as the original it 's full of so much humor that you ca n't help but cut it a break i laughed quite a few times and there are a lot of fun moments however the film is a bit uneven the movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard john travolta reprises his role as chili palmer hollywood gangster who now turns his eye to the music business using his negotiation skills '' he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend played by uma thurman and try to get his young singer christina milian a hit record an impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking the best performance is given by the rock and it 's nice to see him in a different type of role vince vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end surprisingly uma thurman gives an average performance and i was expecting more from her john travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull christina milian gives a horrible performance and she 's also not that good of a singer cedric the entertainer gives a good performance though he is n't in the film for very long andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well there are also a bunch of cameos including steven tyler and james wood gary gray directs and he does a poor job he just does n't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess there was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile also at 118 minutes the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots the film needed to be edited badly and it clearly was n't fortunately for the film the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes sometimes the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny compared to the original the sequel does n't measure up well however be cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy in the end be cool is worth a rental and that 's it ||| 1
i do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena i have watched them all marcus welby right on through er scrubs is the most realistic albiet representation of our professions you can not take everything seriously but if you believe an emergency room can function like er and still have people standing you 're out of touch reality as well ||| 1

director richard donner ladyhawke superman lethal weapon i ii iii iv etc leads an ensemble cast of stars gerard butler billy connolly frances o'connor ethan embry morton csokas and david thewlis back into time only to find out that if history had not been changed by these characters the present might not exist ! '' yeah ! i wrote those words ! not another critic yet it 's a true analysis of this fantastic film ! if you loved richard donner 's ladyhawke then timeline 2003 based on the novel by michael crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely ! modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor on the way and in the way are knights of not so good caliber ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there ! my rating of timeline is five stars ! i can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you the viewer to truly enjoy it i 'm not ! when i saw timeline for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful donner production and billy connolly a scot to whom my heart had been lost the character of marek '' gerard butler enslaved me upon my first sight of him ! as creedy '' in reign of fire i 'd fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that i 'd gone to cheer on in the film creedy 's '' torched demise gave me cause to end their existence marek '' is yet another character such as ladyhawkes navarre '' rutger hauer for ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man 's man marek '' is your fellow ! timeline is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to back to the future ! '' this is one film not only well worth the money but well worth the time to view over again and again ! for ladies who despair of a real man keep this one within hand 's grasp at a moment 's notice !

this bbc miniseries has a well earned reputation as being much looser and freer with its literary souce here the source material is not just one work but several works of dh lawrence than most literary adaptations for english television also while most bbc productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and characters in this case the sultry and sophisticated and somewhat libertine in a 1920 's kind of way lady chatterly the earthy and irreverent and smoldering smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class oliver mellors both of these factors can be attributed to director ken russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the bbc 's best programs many of them about musical composers russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking of course most of us in the states know ken russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as tommy 1975 altered states 1979 and gothic 1986 all of which feature lurid dream sequences and some would say gratuitously lewd situations but ken russell is actually a director with many facets and russell 's interest in dh lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best dh lawrence adaptation on film women in love starring glenda jackson oliver reed alan bates he then followed that up twenties years later with the rainbow starring amanda donohoe and sammie davis both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books his additions however were tasteful and even added clarity to the material what is interesting about this new dh lawrence adaptation is that ken russell seems to have remained interested in dh lawrence for so many years and for many of the same reasons dh lawrence more than any other author in the english language or any language for that matter stands for the power of the body and the bodies experience over the power of reason this was the main theme of his earlier dh lawrence adaptations and this is the main theme of his latest but this one is by far the most sensual of the three and that is largely due to the fact that joely richardson seems to be the very embodiment of sensual awakening the actress seems as willing as her character to simply follow the dictates of the body regardless of social norms its always a big deal when a high profile actress especially one with the lineage of joely richardson sheds her clothes on screen but to do so on british televison for all to see takes more than a little boldness the nudity is well done and adds to the allure of this bbc classic no question about that the greatest scene in the entire 4 hour miniseries is not the nudity however but the vision joely has before she ever ventures out to that hut in the woods one night after hearing her blowhard husband lord clifford who cares more for his family estate wragby '' and his class '' than he does about any individual read from socrates about the white horse of reason and the black horse of desire she dreams she is riding through a greek temple full of nude men who seem to be growing like vines out of the stone this is not something that dh lawrence ever wrote this is pure ken russell and yet its the most exciting thing in the whole miniseries plus its the best way to deliver lady chatterly 's state of mind or body to us dh lawrence is actually very wordy for one who claims to be interested in the body more than in the mind but ken russell has found a visual shorthand for delivering those lawrentian themes with nice visuals i only wish there were more moments like this the most sensual acting is done by joely richarson when in her private chambers and russell seems to be keenly aware that it is lady chatterly 's imagination that fires her body after the horse dream connie drapes a veil over her head and walks nude through the house down to lord clifford 's room this scene is more imaginatively and erotically charged than any of the actual love scenes that will follow the actual affair between lady chatterly and oliver mellors is a little odd in fact its very awkward at first they just agree sort of to use each other for sex but of course that never works and soon they are intimates thoroughly engaged with each other body and mind and running naked through the rainy glades and meadows then sitting nake dbefore a fire and pretending to be lady jane and john thomas their understanding '' involves a mutual appreciation of nature and a mutual loathing of lord clifford and the privileges that he defends as birthrights russell gets a lot of mileage out of the racine and proust reading and piano and chess playing lord clifford and his antagonisms toward all those that he perceives to be lower than himself pretty much everyone in the coal mining community that he owns this actor really has fun with this role and russell obviously enjoys his rants because he gives him so many lord clifford is actually a pretty guy in his own way as he does give his wife permission to take a lover but arguably its for selfish reasons he merely wants an heir we certainly pity this wwi vet who must cart himself around in various malfunctioning contraptions metaphors for the mind and its futile tinkerings perhaps what people are reduced to when they no longer have a functioning body but he just wo n't allow anyone to actually like him except his nurse who finds him curiously attractive a plot thread that russell leaves undeveloped he even vents about the lower classes knowing their place '' in the natural '' scheme of things right in front of his house servants russell lingers on the face of one table servant as he does so another striking russell touch no mistaking whose side this film maker is on so this affair of the body between lady chatterly and mellors is actually informed by a social awareness and a mutual understanding and empathy which one could argue is as much about reason as it is about the body in any event we eventually come to accept that these two opposties are drawn to one another for a variety of social and sexual reasons the one perhaps fueling the other lady chatterly 's own father and sister are bohemians so why exactly she was attracted to the repressed snob lord clifford chatterly is a bit of a mystery both her father and sister encourage connie to find lovers but her sister anyway is as much as a snob as lord clifford we 're not certain and we never hear what her father thinks of her affair with the gamekeeper mellors so we never know if the affair has had social repercussions for lady chatterly herself the ending is a bit well i do n't want to give it away suffice it to say that it 's different than the book and it does n't quite resolve those class issues that it raised the answer seems to be leave england perhaps the ending is based on one of lawrence 's short stories in any event ken russell 's creative attitude toward the classics '' is perhaps the most attractive thing about this adaptation i hope his attitude is contagious and will inspire more loose and free treatments of the classics this cultural freedom is refreshing and liberating for mind and body ||| 1
sure i could have compared phantom quest to a lot of other animes out there but the basic premise is the same we get a group of people who are working together to solve mysteries and there is definitely nothing wrong with that a friend of mine introduced me to this series and i must say that i was pleasantly surprised overall if you love having vampires and mummies among other things show up in your anime along with a huge dosage of humor to boot then you will absolutely love this show it manages to take dark subject matter and make it into something comical i think the biggest weakness in this series is definitely a coherent side story it seems like things are a little too hashed together at times and a little too rushed on top of that half of the phantom quest team only shows up when actually needed to do something such as the team exorcist and the fortune teller neither of these two characters really gets a strong introduction at all one more weakness would really be in the music as well which i found continuously grating on my nerves mainly the theme song most of the other music is just merely complaints aside this is definitely worth your time especially for such a small price buy this one you certainly wo n't regret it ||| 1
to be honest i think i found this by looking at listmania lists when i was searching for other anime titles i had never heard of it but the reviews seemed good and the price was more than attractive so i decided to give it a shot although i did n't really expect too much boy am i glad i bought it ! the only thing i did n't like about it was that there were only 4 episodes i know this review says pretty much the same thing as all the other reviews but i figured i should throw in my two cents anyway ||| 1
when i saw this i though why not it does n't look overly violent '' boy am i glad i tried it while there are the usual fight scenes the overriding theme is a wonderful sense of humor as a night owl i adore the morning scenes using different highly original method to awaken the heroine a real keeper and i just wish it was a long series ||| 1
this is the best way to spend the evening with your children it is very well done and the actors made this a neverland not to forget we have watch it multi times and told eveyone we come in contact to rent it buy it but most of all watch it ||| 1
i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs and you 're infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again they come up with this idiotic scheme which ended up in disaster both the hilton and auto world closed within a year moore in recent years has become a political celebrity '' in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it 's not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them are n't really interested in changing anything as it might interfere with their livelihoods i do n't know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent darkly funny film about real class warfare and the dismantling of the working class in america ||| 1
establishmentarian michael moore is mad as hell and he 's not taking it anymore as his smalltown america flint mi has just lost jobs as greedy exects move plant to mexico and put above mentioned thousands out of work moore does a good job of keeping the subject serious for a change other good moore films included fahrenheit 911 and the big one others he 's done get too far into his leftist politics which i am am not into good job here michael ||| 1
a film about the porn industry in the late 70 's early 80 's great cast great performances great story just a great film unique approach to the subject characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion characters played by julianne moore don cheadle heather graham william macy and burt reynolds respectfully are great to watch this is a performance piece ||| 1
i love this movie how can you not with such hilarious diologue one of my most favorites is when yzma outlines her first plan to get rid of kuzko ending with a hilarious i 'll smash it with a hammer ! '' but diologue aside there 's so much more to this movie the characters are so wonderfully individual from kuzko to evil yzma with her secret lab '' to dim witted kronk with his shoulder angel and devil secondly look what i can do um i do n't see how that no no he 's got a point over and over agian this movie will keep you laughing watch and enjoy ||| 1

frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound this is due to its subject its star and its director julie taymor who also gave us the astounding titus if you have not yet seen titus do so before finishing this review it is an art director 's tour de force on a par with brazil regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum one ca n't help but be intrigued by the fascinating and certainly unconventional people of frida diego rivera played superbly by alfred molina boasted the traditional faults of great artists narcissism thoughtless cruelty obsessive egotism while showcasing some exceptional ones art as propaganda device naive political idealism his flaws were as large as his murals but he was never dull in addition to starring as frida salma hayek the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made how wonderful that she did hayek has traveled under a hollywood curse appearing in one dreadful picture after another this is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by and her performance is note perfect the story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy but hayek never lets that happen her frida is heart and steel all at once amazing the take home message if there is one is that great art is never free in the case of rivera others paid the price he fed off others like a greedy child in the case of frida kahlo she herself paid the price digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave there are moments of magic realism in frida where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were astounding autobiographical statements there are a few missteps the liaisons with trotsky and josephine baker feel almost obligatory as if a form is being filled out but blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments for example when rivera 's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in mexico beyond highly recommended must viewing ||| 1
we enjoy listiening and watching this dvd on our hdtv we play this when have friends over with the volume low and find them humming or singing along ||| 1
of all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of allah on that day this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching because of this those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events and perhaps none more so than caesar '' in his review of 17 2006. if only he found at least as troubling the carnage bloodshed and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his islamic buddies against civilian populations but more on this in a bit as regards this extraordinary video from the perspectives of air traffic controllers faa officials norad and neads the air crews and passengers on board each of the four doomed flights to the testimonies of the witnesses participants firefighters and all the heroes on and near ground zero this is the singular documentary that takes you minute by minute through the hell deliberately planned and perpetrated by those whose religion had them believing that the execution of such hellish bloodshed granted them heaven and no this is not the propaganda '' or view of the documentary but instead my own conclusions drawn on many years of personal investigation of islam anyone who like caesar '' here could watch this fully factual account and then call such a splendid documentary propaganda '' try ing to portray the us as good guys being hit by the bad guys '' reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own hatred for so apparently condoning such ghastly horrors as the acts of good guys '' retaliating against bad guys '' while caesar '' how telling a nickname attempts to school us ignorant americans on our country 's past foibles yet he fails to mention the billions in financial and economic aid we have given the islamic nations the millions in military equipment and technical advisory assistance provided them as they struggled against invading soviet forces other foreign enemies attempting to annex and rule over sovereign islamic nations the ousting from kuwait of the brutal armed forces of an islamic fascist dictator who had invaded and then enjoyed '' weeks of the metaphoric and all too literal raping in this tiny islamic nation while openly looting terrorizing butchering torturing and murdering its citizens while none of its islamic neighbors lifted so much as a finger to intervene but instead begged the united nations and the to solve their problems for them which we did ! and these are just a tiny listing of the far greater acts we have done for the cause of justice and good and all of it on islam 's behalf and yet is only the latest and greatest terrorist massacre by which we continue to be repaid by the bloodthirsty religion of islam for all we have done and continue to do on its behalf caesar '' also glaringly omits and all too conveniently ignores radical islam 's history and their policy of religiously motivated bomb blasts hijackings kidnappings tortures rapes gang rapes female circumcisions sawing hacking off people 's limbs and heads mutilations and always mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide including those of their own religion and all thanks to islam 's foundational tenets of blood lust that makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable eternally rewardable and thus forever inevitable true all religions have their radicals and fanatics but none deliberately attract nurture and encourage terrorist fanatics more than does islam and none preaches genocide against the entire jewish and all infidels '' in the name of god more than does islam and it is how this video accurately documents for the entire world only this latest and greatest mass butchery in the name of allah that probably motivates caesar '' most to attempt such blatant propagandizing here and for those who would disagree i challenge caesar '' or anyone else to provide us any reliable evidence of even a single factual error in this documentary what i think caesar '' fears most is that such a powerful documentary as this might add to the growing world view that despite the constant rhetoric of islam as a religion of peace '' the terrorist acts of its leaders and constituents in the name of islamic religion reveal the exact opposite to be the true case maybe it 's just me but i 'm thinking any religion that so encourages its young men to blow themselves up with as many infidels '' as they can so as to spend eternity in orgiastic sex with 72 virgins deserves to be fully prosecuted at the very least on charges of conspiracy to commit mass murder '' ! and one thought that just hit me if more and more islamics continue to either commit or condone such bloodshed and with the full approval of their islamic leaders which god are they truly honoring and emulating allah the creator of life or instead iblis satan the destroyer of it by their fruits are they known after all and on the question of whom and what islamics most worship and adore permit me to close this review as also does this wonderful documentary by quoting one of islam 's most renowned clerics '' we love death the loves life that is the big difference between us '' osama bin laden ||| 1

this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch even if it does n't feel as audacious as i 'm sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby it is the epitome of all love stories as a old depressive connects with a old woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death as they keep showing up at the same funerals however the root of their respective interests could n't be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive while the harold simply likes the morbidity of it all the plot is really about their burgeoning relationship while his mother constantly attempts to make the harold more socially acceptable first she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates to foil any hope of romance with these women however he stages which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother she then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother victor a hawkish officer and vietnam war amputee to try to convince harold to join the army the episodic structure of the story by collin higgins years before becoming a director in his own right with foul play '' and nine to five '' allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters ' actions the movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone ruth gordon is her typically pixilated self an archetype she played for years afterward while bud cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of cynicism it 's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later there are funny sideline performances by vivian pickles as harold 's mother ellen geer as an overly actressy blind date named sunshine and eric christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest cat stevens ' soundtrack has n't aged as well as say simon and garfunkel 's music in the graduate '' but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings unfortunately the 2000 dvd contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included ||| 1
this presents us with a visual voyage into music that in my opinion excels that if the original fantasia not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid colorful and highly diverse from segment to segment but the representation of the music is in itself sheer genius as i have come to expect from disney at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure this much i believe is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music ||| 1
i have to say it took me a while to getting around to seeing this i thought silence of the lambs '' was good it featured a great performance by anthony hopkins and the rest of it was but that was about it as far as i was concerned it just did n't really click with me and it was n't anything near the great movie i 'd been hoping for so when its sequel was released i did n't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released a bit surprisingly though i thought hannibal '' was really great once i finally did see it everyone said it was more geared toward horror than silence '' which is fine by me and it may have been marginally but much more than that it was just a better horror movie than its predecessor and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie in my opinion hopkins is just as good if not better than he was as hannibal lecter the first time around and while i usually do n't like recasting roles in a movie unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you do n't see their real face or hear their real voice and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong julianne moore did a great job stepping into the clarice starling role originally played by jodie foster the movie centers around the hunt to find lecter by the only victim of his original carnage to survive a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against lecter it seems like hannibal '' has changed tract from silence '' and is implying that most if not all of lecter 's victims may have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves whether that 's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible the effect was to create a foil for hannibal who 's even more evil than he is hannibal lecter himself is well he 's not a 'good guy ' in this movie he is though presented in very cryptic shades of grey his behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real and he 's much more interesting as a character this time around clarice also is she comes across here as a character who 's somehow traumatized perhaps even mentally unbalanced deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like lecter to ever see it and that 's what so intrigued him in the first place one possible interpretation of things overall and this is just one of many potential takes on it the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it making it a great source of conversation for is that hannibal lecter is a person who the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil while clarice starling has the potential for great darkness and violence in her but chose to be good chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness a lot of food for thought in this one no pun intended great performances all around in notable addition to hopkins and moore the brilliant gary oldman plays lecter 's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and ray liotta plays an unlikable rather creepy fbi agent who 's constantly at odds with starling a very very engaging and movie ||| 1
we just got this dvd last week but ever since that time it has remained in the dvd player and has been viewed at least a dozen times by my three year old daughter cassidy she loves this dvd and all the planets that come to life she sings along and has really learned her planets the songs are top notch the dvd is enjoyable for adults even after ten viewings when most kid videos would become painful ||| 1

federico fellini 's 1972 film is not his best when he has 8 la strada and la dolce vita to his credit while many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless dreamy structure i found it boring and phantasmagorical it is simply fellini 's version of rome and not rome the eternal city itself to risk sounding negative i shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970 's rome the scenes in which the hippies and american tourists invade the city the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off though saying some pretty vulgar things and my favorite the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old roman patricians fade into oblivion but mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot it starts off alright and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences fellini is himself in this movie as well as gore vidal fellini envisions himself as a young man studying rome in his youth in a strict catholic school the shows ancient monuments like the colliseum the apian way trevi fountain and vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman 's behind and later as a young man journeys to rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless vulgar and i found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage ! it bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution brothels or cheap slutty women the cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film and for a film about rome and italy there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater the pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous only serious hardcore fans of fellini will want to own this dvd it is a perfect to his equally absurd and sexually radical satyricon loosely based on the old roman epic ||| 1
this dvd is the bomb ! why prince puts on a show from morris day and the a must see to the lenny kravitz and prince jam session true prince fans will love seeing his energy and creativity prince is a real performer who puts his heart and soul in every dance move and song as for the spirituality aspect i loved to see that side of him the song he sang was powerful and heartfelt get the dvd you wo n't be disappointed ||| 1
if you 're even showing an interest to then you most likely own or have seen even then i recommend this one as much as any of them since you got ta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end anyways offers the same fun antics the vol did but unfortunately when compared to you 'll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all any sword fighting that actually occur usually does n't last long enough to be considered a fight '' but this dvd makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the vol so enjoy it i know i did ||| 1
you got ta get the whole series ca n't just get one or two dvds you need the whole thing trust me once you start you got ta go all the way to the end ||| 1
this movie is worth owning it 's a classic tale well done and very entertaining ||| 1
this is a great kid 's movie with a lot of characters and a great story plot it 's a good combination of a musical and a story with good characters and characters that do not make good choices SMILE i would suggest not over thinking the story line it 's a kid 's movie after all and no its not all about the flying cars believe me even a two year old is capable of appreciating more ! ||| 1
this is a classic musical that i grew up watching on network tv it has the great love story for the girls and the cool gaget car for the boys i bought it to share with my kids and they loved it ||| 1
i did n't watch this one before because of all the hype too many buddy comedies were coming through the pipe this one caught me by surprise it really was first rate two dudes who 're crashing weddings so they 'll always have a date party animals with very rigid rules break it off before sunrise commitment 's just for fools until one day one falls in love the other falls in lust if you want to see vince vaughn get hurt then this one is a must sometimes sappy sometimes sweet and often lewd and loud but it does n't stoop to flatulence so it stands out from the crowd amanda richards november 5 2006 ||| 1

i was just gon na watch the film because i think robert de niro is one of the greatest actors ever but then the film takes on a behind the scenes of being black that truly adds another factor to this 's a trip out film ||| 1
this movie has recieved several bad reviews and i can understand that this movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical first gay love movie '' but if you like movies that are not this one if a must have the movie is not a hardcore sex movie in fact there is only one scene of sex in the movie the positives of this movie are it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love one that does n't turn out in the same way other movies portray again i only recomend this movie to people who enjoy complex movies and are not looking for just hardcore sex ||| 1
i love this movie while the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film she 's all that '' does n't go overboard and surprisingly presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata after zach the class president and soccer star is very publically dumped by his magically delicious '' and equally popular girlfriend taylor he 's hard put to maintain his legacy though a little slow zach 's friend dean bets him that he ca n't replace taylor and make any girl prom queen enter laney boggs an art student who cares little about the social scene dean picks laney as zach 's prom queen project '' and zach has a hard time convincing laney to even go out with him meanwhile taylor the ex is dating a real world reject who she met over spring break but she 's still catty over her discards '' and is horrible to laney embarassing her at a party the more time zach spends with laney the more he starts to like her and laney begins to open up and finds a real outlet in her art dean sensing he might be about to lose the bet asks laney to prom before zach gets around to it and a recently single taylor attaches herself to zach 's arm assuming he 'll take her back ultimately feelings are hurt battle lines are drawn and a really cool dance scence takes place at the prom i love the fresh comedy in the movie that is amusing for teens without being impractical or raunchy the characters are and actually evolve in a realistic fashion even if you are left wondering how zach ever dated taylor vaughn there 's really nothing comparable to the teen movies like sixteen candles '' or pretty in pink '' because those are genres unto themselves but she 's all that '' is definitely a nice representation of a good modern teen movie ||| 1
what more could a true parrotthead ask for than jimmy buffett live at wrigley field this dvd set captures the truly historic concert from chicago jimmy and the band put on a great show it makes you feel as though you were part of the show the bonus coverage is not to be miseed the time lapse of setting up the stage is fun to watch and the banner performance rivals jimi hendrix this is a must for any music lover but the true parrottheads will definitely need to add it to their collection ||| 1
i have always enjoyed watching this movie with so many great stars some whom are no longer with us never owned it on video now i have it on dvd great price too ! ! it was worth it ||| 1

this is like the classic that killed other classics for some reason this is around the time when characters started dying off more in anime so anime was never the same around this time based off the manga loosely i mean some parts are changed or edited over here the manga was rare so try it if you like this type of animation still one of my favorites in terms of anime classics beware this is a type of movie that will kick you in your face and start to laugh a very hyper violent film lot 's of action ! ||| 1

i love leslie sansone 's videos she 's quirky and a bit ditzy '' but her workouts are always easy to follow and fun this is no exception there have been previous complaints about her cues not being good enough but i had absolutely no even on my first try if you do n't want to miss a beat pay close attention at you 'll hear the directions i bought this because i loved walk and jog so much walk and kick is not quite as intense but it still works up a sweat for a day where you 're not working quite as hard this is a great workout for people interested in a bit of kickboxing but not for experience kickboxers i also saw complaints about leslie saying some silly things about the size of her nose dusting the floor etc this is classic leslie chatter and i personally think it makes the workout go faster if you do n't like the chatter of her other videos you wont like this one as an avid watp video user i give this one a big thumbs up ||| 1
excellent pay per view one of the best of 2002. here 's the matches 1 elimination table match 3 minute warning rico jeff hardy bubba ray and spike dudley great opener lots of high spots included for pounders 3 minute warning really can move surprise ending 2 cruiserweight championship jamie noble champion billy kidman both looked impressive during the match putting on a superb bout watch for noble 's sick ddt and kidman aerial moveset 3 hardcore match for women 's championship trish stratus champion victoria a solid women 's division match tons of weapons but a weak finish victoria supposedly injured her acl in this match but i could n't find the spot maybe you can 4 wwe championship brock lesnar champion big show of course brock was able to suplex the big show and brock was able to get him up for the which paul heyman doubted the match unfolded quickly and equipped a strong end 5 wwe tag team championship elimination match edge rey mysterio champions kurt angle chris benoit los guerreros using a tag title bout as a match did n't pay out well rey possessed an intense aereal arsenal compared to his present one worth watching 6 world championship elimination chamber match triple h champion kane chris jericho rob van dam booker t shawn michaels i was hoping someone would bring the match atop the chamber but was disappointed and the fact that jericho was a world tag team champion at the time puzzled me since christian his partner was n't even on the show besides that a great main event rvd nearly crushed triple h 's throat at one point jericho knew how to work an elimination chamber at perfectly overall for survivor series 2002. worth buying ||| 1
i found the movie to be very creative and unique i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage for a play would be i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed greed true love spirituality determination issues and jealousy i am not a prince fan but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them clever i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won ||| 1
sybil is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public the performances by sally field and joanne woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter child abuse and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques both the book and the movie became musts for students of abnormal psychology at that time and for decades afterwards joanne woodward reverses her roles from the three faces of eve '' to portray cornelia wilbur with consummate skill while sally field 's performance as sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another the movie works with thirteen of the book 's sixteen personalities without being overtly graphic the movie conveys all of the horrors of sybil 's childhood with an incredible impact the rest of the cast is excellent with martine bartlett 's hattie '' sybil 's mother in the chilling forefront and natasha ryan as little sybil close behind the real sybil unaware that sally field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with joanne woodward let it be known that she wanted stewart stern and daniel petrie to try and get sally for her part from the extras bonus disk i ca n't recommend the movie and the book enough to students of human behavior and psychology whether for personal of professional interests it took hollywood 30 years to try remaking the film which should indicate how high the bar was set by this original cast and production ||| 1
this is my first watp video but i started at the highest mile because i am an exerciser so i knew i needed something high intensity to get my heart rate going but mostly i was looking for variety in my workout and i must say i just love this video it is the only video i own that makes me want to do it i truly enjoy working out but when i find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up i know i hit the jackpot this workout can be perfect for most exercisers although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the super challenge leslie is a good instructor but as most have mentioned she does talk quite a bit and has a very annoying laugh but its about the workout not the sound of her voice and in that watp super challenge accomplishes alot i hope to buy more of her videos in the future ||| 1
as an american i find this video showing the incredible distruction and the first responders who are operating at the scene of this enormous tragedy compelling to think that this terrorist attack actually happened on our soil is truly unbelievable another reviewer from france states that the footage is nothing special ! that is the furthest from the truth ! i guess the he believes that the terrorist attack never took place ! this is an historic document that should be seen by every american ! ||| 1

an animated family of complete with spandex it all turns out pretty well incredible pixar and disney have made six exceptional films together but i find myself reaching for this one almost every time needless to say superhero films are no longer novelties yet this film seems to have new angles on seemingly cliched themes the lawsuits that put the supers '' out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives brad bird who wrote and directed the incredibles '' some unexplored avenues to try which he does and it turned out well pretty incredible ! what it 's all about first we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as supers '' and instead turns into average american after the lawsuits that ended the supers '' crime fighting dynasty along the way they had three very different yet super '' offspring ! wow that 's enough right there to keep us busy we also have which include each one of the 3 children 's coming of age in a super '' way but as ordinary kids the kids like their parents struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family we have bob parr incredible going through what appears to be a crisis and his confused wife helen who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else but after all how can elastigirl '' be just another soccer mom we have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan buddy who turns the incredibles '' lives and for the first time the supers '' are the underdogs ! everything that follows satisfying family issues much more after these elements are set into motion we have everything that follows and it is fascinating to see all the incredibles ' family issues worked out like any other family 's but with many interesting twists the incredibles '' is a super film ! dvd features anamorphic widescreen very widescreen digital to digital transfer is the sharpest i have seen yet ! lots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did the attack '' is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between '' and the i just wish it was longer the behind the scenes featurettes '' are worth watching as are the blooper scenes though they seem a bit contrived there are two commentary tracks one with brad bird and john walker producer and another with the animators i could not watch the entire movie with either track on maybe you can the files about the supers '' are interesting there is lots more if you like to go in for it you can spend the day with the features alone for me however there is the film this is the best animated film in my opinion and is perfect for all members of the family of all ages to connect with in a family sort of way ||| 1
it 's interesting to read some of the other reviews i ca n't understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie it 's imaginative as was nightmare before christmas '' but goes beyond that movie with even better animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving i loved nightmare '' but corpse bride takes all the things i loved and made them better the voices of all the actors ring true the mood is gothic and yet comical the score is rich and defines the movie perfectly the dvd allows you to watch the movie with only the music and that 's a real plus ||| 1
awesome ! bought for my husband for valentine 's day ! even our 8 year old son loved it excellent condition ||| 1
great story great actors beautiful scenery and colors my favorite movie ||| 1
student of history '' is a student of christian biased history there are plenty of qualified scholars and current book like that of theologian bart ehman for one who show that early christianity was based on forged documents that claimed earlier pedigree but were written by ambitious men who sought to dominate a very wide spead of ideas about who and what those events in judea were about not paliestine ! the romans named the region palestine after the war against the jews in the fact that one man constantine sought a single authoritive finality was a political move not an act or miracle of god '' authority of apostles is more christian myth and power assertion not historical proof of the varacity of the bible and christian claims objective scholarship has shown for example that a church father probably iraneus forged copies of josephus by adding the paragraphs that refer to jesus it is easy to understand when we remember that typewriters and copy machines did not exist then ! handwriting is sort of a especially when other earlier copies exist with no insets about jesus what is known about the gospel of thomas and other second century altnative christian texts is that they were warred against by the eventual winner it might have gone otherwise and then people like you would be claiming a completely different set of circumstances as facts people with no authority like iraneus wrote tracts condemning any other view than his own and those of his small cult he called arius of alexander for example a heretic but he had no authority to do so he forged documents to prove it never realizing that in the future others would also forge whatever they found expedient to make reality for believers paul called it lying to bring you the truth '' but a lie is a lie and historians ca n't make lies facts so the yoke of bias due to conditioned belief must be thrown off if one is to be a true historian and seeker of truth the real key '' to the entire mystery and the inspiration for all of these writers is the nagging reality of the original parchments found by the real life priest beringer saunier in 1891 in i have been there several times the original parchments are kept in a vault in london at a loyd 's bank the copies have been studied by many and here is the problem for the debunkers when a fraud is being perpetuated code puzzles are invariably simple and unsophisticated experts agree that the codes on the parchments are so sophisticated that they would have had to have been created by a very intelligent individual a genuis everything can be argued down for lack of enough solid evidence if you wish to prefer christian myths like virgin birth death and resurrection actually earlier pagan myths but the parchments remain a piece of evidence that no un objecive debunker likes to talk about dan brown has made the subject popular again by writing a book and making a film that tantilizes the minds of many people he also gives the public a new level of nonsense to wade through and a rich source of psuedo history for debunkers to feast upon pretending to extend their claim to truth by turning over toys in a kindergarten class if you are going to claim to be a student of history you must be objective and ready to accept what is there not select what suits you and if you want to answer the many very quesitonable claims of chrisitanity and the claimed history of the faith then you must be willing to question the premises once you do that you will find that there is plenty to support doubt just knowing about the catholic destruction of previous historic and relgious records along with anyone who opposed them ought to clue the thinking person that something is up with tradtional christian western history on its face dan brown and and to a greater extent leigh baigent and lincoln have a lot more material than that planted and represented by pierre plantard the discussion of the biblical evidence itself is compelling without ever having pierre plantard at all why is there a large tradition of all people extant at the time that simon of cyrene was crucified not jesus muslims claim this today and christian freemasons are aware of the source i have seen it myself and if we really want to be factual about it there never was a jesus christ in judea paul created his church in greece and the hellenized region of asia minor jesus christ '' is greek if there was a character that jesus was based on his name would have been josua ben joseph and his brother james '' would be jacob if you dig in you will find no basis for a person named jesus exists and the probability that the jesus christ character was only paul 's creation based on another person who was crucified as a rebel by the romans and whose sect venerated his death as a memorial that became part of their sect of judiasm one book of found in the dead sea scrolls is the book of enoch freemasons have owned a copy of it and it is tracable to at least 1717 when the grand lodge in london announced itself how does a book that only became known to the public when the closely guarded srolls were finally made public in the already exist among a society of brotherhood that can be traced to the knights templar this is not myth but a sample of factual connections one can make if they objectively study the quesitons culling out the fluff and theory from fact for 20 years as i have i did n't just read i traveled it takes a long time to verify or debunk a historical claim or theory these people who study the subject for a year and then write a book amuse me but very well i completely enjoyed the film the da vinci code even though i could not read the book because i knew too much of the where he got his ideas from to read it leigh richard leigh teabing michael baigent and the gm of the priory named sauniere there is a code for begginers in the book but i am no beginner still i found the film enjoyable and i even thought the book is a good thing because i am a bit like the leigh teabing character in the da vinci code i believe that a lie even to build a faith is a lie and overall the worse will come from it histoy shows that to be true religions are built on lies made for the purpose of power and control over others what we witness now in the world is more of that with more and worse to come it is probably useless but only when people can know the real truth and throw off the superstition and neurosis of religion including and especially christianity but all others as well will the human race have a chance to become something besides a mass of ants bent of self destruction if there is any use for the historian it must be to serve as a witness and a warning how long will we repeat history as long as we insist on institutionalizing lies and myth in the meantime established christian indluence and owned media produce airy debates quoting the bible and it 's own set of biblical facts as ultimate fact because they have n't yet gone to the bottom of the scholarly bebate and do n't want to ||| 1
i have loved this movie since i first it back in the early 1990 's in all honesty it is pretty crudy but that 's what i love about it the music is fantastic and the costumes are unique divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and ricki lake was perfect for the role link is pretty hunky too ||| 1
i never tire of this film the acting the marvelous filming locations the costumes perfection i ca n't watch it without wanting to have a cup of tea and a hot scone to accompany the viewing in fact i once stopped the video baked scones and continued to watch it while munching a freshly baked scone and a cuppa try it i now own the dvd also ||| 1
i have no idea why i had never heard of this movie before because ronin is a whale of a good film i can take or leave most action films but give me a taut intelligent suspenseful thriller filled with great action wicked twists and some of the best footage you 'll ever see and i 'm happy throw jean reno and the one and only robert de niro into the mix as well and i 'm happier than any clam has a right to be director john frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone does n't make for a good action film and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene the title is derived from the term for masterless samurai of feudal japan warriors who failed their master and were left to wander in the shame of their failure in modern parlance and in this movie the term applies to special agents of various governments who find themselves quite on their own thanks to the end of the cold war these men still put their skills to good use by selling their services to those willing to pay them for handling sensitive usually dirty jobs in this case sam de niro vincent reno and three others are brought together in france by an irish lass named deirdre and charged with acquiring a metal case by its current carrier it sounds easy ambush the target and his security force snatch the case exchange it for cash and move on naturally the mission turns out to be extremely complicated as a couple of powerful parties want whatever is in that case and a certain individual proves less than trustworthy what 's the world coming to when you ca n't even trust a selfish de niro has to run over and shoot up half of france before everything gets resolved in this film the only problem i had with this movie came in the form of the thick accents of some of the characters especially the irish ones you may want to use closed captioning at times to really understand everything that is said the actors themselves though were quite good especially de niro and reno who make a great team as for the mix of bad guys how about three count 'em three former adversaries of james bond michael lonsdale sean bean and jonathan pryce not only that the script is worthy of all these fine actors as i 've mentioned already though the chase scenes are really the most memorable aspect of this film frankenheimer does n't have any use for these new digital means for manufacturing this kind of action instead treating the viewer to several good thrill rides through the streets of paris and its local environs besides filming an incredible number of scenes live he also chose to forego the accompaniment of a musical score in these situations letting the revving engines squealing brakes and numerous crashes and explosions present the action as authentically as possible they had to have had an incredible number of stunt drivers and stunt men involved as folks were constantly crashing or jumping out of the path of oncoming cars not to mention the extended high speed chase down streets into busy oncoming traffic i 'm telling you these chase scenes are impressive obviously i think ronin has it all without de niro it still would have been a fantastic film with him it 's a in my book ||| 1
the bells of mary 's '' was a shrewd move by paramount studios and director leo mccarey whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical catholic priest father o'malley going my way '' spawned the 1945 release which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict irish catholic mccarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed going my way '' and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the catholic world inhabited by father o'malley bing crosby had garnered a best actor oscar for going my way '' and mccarey secured the services of the beautiful ingrid bergman to play sister benedict the mother superior of mary 's school crosby found himself immediately clashing with bergman on certain points relating to the parish but through it all a mutual respect existed between them each realized that the other was committed to the best interests of mary 's dudley nichols a best original screenplay academy award winner a decade earlier for the john ford film about the irish political conflict starring victor mclaglen the informer '' directed his effort in the script toward presenting crosby and bergman in periodic conflict but learning from those experiences much of the contrast they realize stems from the way that men and women view situations one phase of the film showing this difference is when bergman teaches a young student who has been victimized by a bully how to box as a means of restoring order she feels a tinge of guilt since the youngster 's failure to fight back and receipt of a beating in the process stemmed from his obedience to her stricture against fighting at mary 's when crosby pursues a conventional macho posture in extolling the need for protecting oneself and praises the fighting skills of the bully the nun has had enough she purchases a boxing instructional book written by former heavyweight champion gene tunney and adeptly instructs the obedient youngster in the manly art of as he ultimately teaches the bully a lesson crosby recognizes her teaching skill and becomes cognizant of the strength of her feminine viewpoint an area where crosby and bergman cooperate is in seeking the answer to the nun 's fervent prayer she believes that of the mortgage holder of their property henry travers who has built a modern building next door and seeks to use the church property for an employee parking lot may through prayer and proper persuasion be convinced to give them his modern structure the result would be a new school and no further need to use the tired current facility the effectiveness of crosby and bergman stems from their soft sell technique with just the right pinch of christian charitable thought thrown into the mix travers who can not sleep nights and experiences heart problems confides to the priest and nun separately that he wishes he was better liked their soft sell approach in advancing the it is more blessed to give than to receive '' precept along with the accompanying feel good element of charity prompts travers to see things in a light more favorable to the interests of mary 's crosby and bergman are delights to behold in this feel good film they provide challenges to each other through disagreement and an effective front when they team up on the issue of greatest importance to them the welfare of mary 's parish ||| 1

how many times have you watched an exercise video hosted by a bouncy perky blonde with a plastic smile making you feel like a fat lazy slob or maybe it was an arrogant hollywood trainer with that fitter than thou '' sneer these instructors just do n't seem like real people with real lives outside the gym do they well ana caban is different she has a warm relaxed presence with grace borne of years of ballet she explains the moves thoroughly without talking down to the viewer and she gives the impression that she does pilates because she likes the results not because she is an exercise fanatic the exercises are geared toward the beginner yet offer enough of a challenge to keep you busy for a while when you 've mastered the beginner workout she also leads an intermediate workout which offers greater challenges but the familiarity of ana 's friendly demeanor i have a hard time making myself exercise but when it comes to buckling down and choosing something to do for myself this is the dvd i pop in the machine i 've purchased several exercise tapes and dvd 's over the years but this one has definitely seen the most use ||| 1
witch hunter robin is a great series which i enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series the visuals are first rate the music when there is music is beautiful and the storyline is intriguing silence and extended stares cloak the characters in mystery so what 's the problem that same cloak covers the series in what could potentially be a series of yawns one of the major problems with witch hunter robin is the pace many serious animes either take themselves too seriously or not seriously enough whr takes itself much too seriously surely the story and visuals are worth it but for some reason there are long tiring sequences during the course of the series which are supposed to be meaningful '' they are i suppose in retrospect one will notice this once they watch the final episodes of whr but the events in the series do not warrant such extended periods of self reflection on the part of the main character s the psychological and philosophical themes present are obvious toward the end of the series and where they are not the intelligent viewer can pretty much guess at them i realize that this exhausted review of whr seems to only be about the tiresome pace at which the series progresses but it 's an important factor as it leaves many to simply drop the series half way before ever seeing the later episodes the best episodes in my opinion a second problem is also the fact that there are a number of witch capturing '' which take place during the series that seem well silly the beginning of the series is all about these capturing surely after seeing the last couple of episodes the viewer begins to understand how this ties into rounding out the characters but during the course of the series this might just bore you to tears especially if a number of episodes feature that simply do n't interest you which they may not the creativity and design behind many of them is poor to say the least in the end the series is about the characters story and visuals not the enemies which frequently populated much of the series if you find yourself hooked on the main characters and their when they are introduced in the beginning of the series then you might like the whole thing lastly as for reviewers that were expecting something scary '' most of the shows on adult swim are for adults and the anime shows featured on adult swim are geared toward those typically interested in other things beside quick thrills needless to say those watching the series probably are n't into it because the name of the series is witch hunter '' they are instead hopefully looking for a high quality cohesive anime this is not for individuals wanting to watch an action anime however it 's more of a beautiful drama younger anime viewers are not bound to like this one at all ! ! ! i 'd give it a try first renting it before you go out and spend money on it ! ||| 1
season 1 of millennium '' featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made the '' look sunny by comparison unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a murder mystery of the week '' fare thankfully the second season supervised by former '' producers glen morgan and james wong changed all that the second season began with the suspenseful 'beginning and the end ' where frank black pursues the mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife this episode also introduces the comic relief for season two computer hacker brian roedecker even though 'the beginnning and the end ' would fit perfectly in season 1 the subsequent episodes follow a different path that greatly improved the series starting with the second episode 'beware of the dog ' and continuing with episodes such as 'the hand of sebastian ' 'owls ' 'roosters ' and the haunting season finale 'the fourth time is now ' we find out that the millennium group has existed since the beginnings of christianity and is n't nearly as altruistic as frank black and the viewers originally suspected in addition to the millennium group storyline we also learn more about frank 's childhood via two holiday episodes 'the curse of frank black ' a tale where frank encounters the ghost of a neighbor who committed suicide and 'midnight of the century ' an emotional story of frank trying to mend the relationship between him and his father in the latter we find out that frank was not the only one with a strange gift as his mother was with the ability to see angels lastly the second season even showcased two comedy episodes 'jose chung 's doomsday defense ' and 'somehow satan got behind me ' these hours of television are completely different from the average millennium '' episode to say the least but they 're still worth a look nonetheless i could continue rambling on and on about the greatness of season two but you 'll really have to buy the dvd set and form your own opinions the dvd set does come with some bonus features but the only one of worth is the season two documentary turning of the tide '' the rest of the bonus materials are at best ||| 1
one of the most maligned movies of 2004 is not that bad in a fine example of how critics and hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it oliver stone delivers an epic take on the life of alexander the great not up to par with the great hollywood epics but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe the incredible life of alexander the great is epic movie material if i 've ever seen any his rise to ruler of the world by his mid twenties is chronicled here with noticeable gaps in the timeline his personal life is just as fascinating as his public one his decidedly odd family life as depicted by stone anyway and his lovers both male and female are just as integral to the story as his military victories perhaps the ultimate momma 's boy just wanted to be loved alexander is a workable and sometimes fascinating historical epic it certainly does n't deserve the drubbing it got in the press wonderful cinematography and a fascinating subject are undermined by uneven performances and some poor storytelling decisions but there 's a lot to like i 'll take my history this way instead of as an over sentimentalized bit of claptrap like the patriot or pearl harbor any day forget the buzz and check it out rent it if like me you find much to enjoy there are plenty of copies on any used dvd rack give it a chance and make the decision for yourself my bet is you 'll find a lot to appreciate ||| 1

this movie is going to bring you down that 's a fact but it 's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves a classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man it 's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the u boat service ||| 1

the movie one of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90 's and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind and despite the whining from some usually hardline christian corners it 's not at all what it is is simply great imaginative and clever film making and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from mimi rogers ably supported by the likes of david duchovny will patton and patrick bauchau i 'm not going to go into it too deeply simply because it 's one of those films that should be seen and experienced with as little up front knowledge as possible please note that i 'm not attacking christians or christianity above just a small but as usual vocal closed minded minority that always gets up in arms about any film that dares tackle any such subject with any degree of honesty instead of going down the traditional biblical fawning path people who will instantly hate a film like this just on principle '' and then proclaim to all that they should avoid such trash '' you know exactly the kind of people i 'm talking about they 're a minority they just happen to be a very vocal and closed minded one and none of that has anything to do with their christianity as much as it has to do with their absolute closed mindedness and their fear of anything that dares stray from a certain comfortable path the dvd the good news this film is finally on dvd and with a pretty decent audio commetary to boot the bad news the movie has been badly misframed which is something that becomes obvious in a couple of key scenes especially i 'm not sure whether this was done as a form of censorship as the misframing of one scene does effectively nullify a sequence of any real nudity that it once had or whether it was just a botched transfer but it is clearly misframed regardless as i saw this film twice on it 's theatrical run and the framing is different now than it was then plus the misframing is quite obvious anyway and on the audio commentary you can even hear remarks about the film pertaining to parts of the print that are no longer visible due to said misframing so clearly they were watching the film in it 's proper framing unfortunately this does n't appear to be available anywhere else on dvd so if you want the film on dvd right now this is your only option just be aware going in and hope for a better release somewhere down the track apart from the framing issue the sound and audio quality are perfectly fine and the only other notable extra is the film 's trailer the bottom line a really good bold interesting film on a disappointing and variable quality dvd mr j ||| 1
there are many reviews here and i believe in their own way they all are right about this film to some degree my main recommendation is to be sure to watch it more than once if you do it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place daniel once again makes this film you feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the wrong woman '' pfeiffer after being engaged to the right woman '' ryder he is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film due to circumstances beyond his control he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman there is a palpable underlying eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by and pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair after i had watched this film one time primarily due to i had decided to give it away i left it alone for about 2 weeks and then watched it again since then i have watched it several times and i enjoy it more and more with each viewing my only real complaint i hate the blond hair they gave pfeiffer it 's just all wrong for her nevertheless she is so beautiful take the time to watch this at least two times if you do i think you 'll find it 's a keeper ||| 1
after the original herbert west jeffery combs and dan cain bruce abbot have returned from medical miltary duty in south america as they return back home as they have perfected their formula to continue experimentint but herbert however gets an idea to collect body parts especially the heart of cain 's old girlfriend meg '' to create the perfect woman however carl hill david gale has been back to life by accident as he still has powers to control zombies and want revenge for what west did to him not as great as the 1985 cult horror comedy masterpiece '' but really enjoyable ! the acting is kind of average but there 's nice splatter in this movie including a variety of odd critters like a finger creature with a human eye attached done by screaming mad george david allen puppet master q the winged serpant and young sherlock holmes like the original movie this has dark humor to propell along with gruesomeness all in all is that it 's not a bad but still worth watching this dvd is pratically bareboned with a alright transfer with no trailer ! but that 's ok if you enjoyed the original then you 'll probably like this one as well ||| 1
this show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal from the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i 've been a huge fan of the series i was so sad to hear it 'd been cancelled but i was n't surprised it was one of the shows i loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air now that the dvds are out i can relive these 13 fleeting moments in tv that are to me some of the funniest things i 've ever seen apart from the hilarious oddball performances from michael michael and david the series was packed with guest stars including edward norton paul rudd and a whole lot more really anyone that is a fan of comedy ala strangers with candy will find this funny it has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts favorite episodes include campaign paper route coffee shop novel meeting girls and vegetables the extras on the dvd are really top notch including commentary tracks for every episode a lengthy and interesting history of stella '' and much more the commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other giving some insight into the creation process while remaining pretty well aware their show met with ratings they take it all in stride and are n't too proud to poke fun at themselves i think if this show had been on comedy central around the time strangers with candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons it 's a shame definitely worth getting turning off your phone and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season and when i say plow that 's a pun ! ||| 1
excellent series the court room scene is hilarious i am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti americanism of this series i refer to the portrayal of the american guest as well as in upstairs downstairs in both series as in other british tv dramas americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic what about the henry wharton type aristocrats who toured england in the century hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them when will series 2 be released ||| 1
if you 're a fan of vampires werewolves action or gothic suspense this is probably a movie you 'd be interested in checking out while it 's not a groundbreaking film it 's a highly entertaining one and one that for me is something i can rewatch several times per year the filming is very attractive everything is dark yet not so dark you ca n't see what 's going on the movie has a gothic look to it from the sets to the costumes to the lighting please do n't mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle the music mostly heavy rock fits in well with the movie and the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch the movie uses several techniques made popular by the matrix '' but who cares it works perfectly within this movie the only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor there 's not a single joke in the entire thing ! everything is so serious and dark that unless you 're in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down that 's how heavy it is as for the set the added scenes provide more insight and the special features are a treat especially the documentary fang fiction '' which talks about vampires and werewolves it was very intriguing if you 're a fan of this movie and you own the dvd already i would recommend selling it and buying this version it 's worth the money ||| 1
this is the best animal movie i have ever a child 's point of view this has been our daughter 's favorite movie for the last one year or so she 's 3 now and after watching it almost every day sometimes several times a day she still enjoys it as much ! we 're surprised that even we are not tired of it the animals are fun to watch the story is interesting and the music is great we 've bought several other animal movies for our daughter and this surpasses all of them the production is superb the animals did a great job and it all seems so real a for everyone who has small kids ||| 1
as i understand it police squad '' was one of the most requested titles for release on dvd it 's taken a while for it to happen but it finally has ! it 's great to be able to replace my vhs tape that i recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a police squad '' marathon having now watched the dvd i now know that for almost 20 years i 've been watching heavily edited versions of the show but not anymore ! other reviewers have described the episodes so i wo n't waste time doing that suffice it to say the show was ahead of its time as it really did n't become popular until it was made into the first naked gun movie 6 years later and had two subsequent hit sequels but i was one of the few who knew in 1982 that it was a clsassic i always wondered why the show never worked on tv but leslie nielsen probably explains it best in his interview that is included on the dvd he says that you actually had to pay attention and most tv is meant to be watched almost passively while doing something else and i think he 's right so it 's great to have these shows the extras are just as the interview with nielsen is too short and i do n't think the commentaries give much to the episodes especially the one commented on by robert wuhl of arliss '' fame who was a writer for the show wuhl must say a dozen times i do n't remember this '' might have helped bob if you took 25 minutes to watch it before watching it for the commentary but i wo n't trim the rating it 's the shows i wanted and have now received ||| 1
the full frame version is just that the unmatted full frame of the filmed image the widescreen version is simply the full frame matted with black bars to fit a wide theater screen this is how it was originally shown in theaters in two spots the dvd lies about the full frame version saying that it 's a pan scan trimming of the widescreen picture 1 the frame menu screen which comes up when the disc boots up and also when you select video setup '' from the main menu this screen shows a screen capture of a film frame that appears at in the movie the capture was taken from the widescreen matted version of the film and the full frame '' image displayed is simply a cropped version of the widescreen image 2 the text the following film has been modified from its original version it has been formatted to fit this screen '' which appears before the full frame version of the movie is played mgm got themselves into trouble for this very same lie on their dvd packaging ||| 1
season 1 wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit incredible acting for a tv series and classic plots all around a great opening season for a classic show season 2 great story lines very different plots thickening of the chemistry between remington and laura with lots of moments the addition of mildred krebs in season 2 was the best move that the show producers made season 3 tops the first two seasons it 's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting the most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great classic show laura stephanie and remington pierce are really just starting to get into the groove of their relationship and mildred doris is just starting to blossom as an actual gumshoe '' it is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons the good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them i would highly recommend purchasing seasons because i 've seen them already as well as the final set of discs seasons 4 5 even though i have not yet watched them i 'm trying to drag it out and make the show last longer ! one major not with the show itself but with the dvd discs is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs stopping completly skipping to the end or back to the beginning skipping chapters etc one disc will not even play in our computer which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax it 's too bad that they do n't take more care transfering great shows like this to quality dvd 's for years of enjoyment the same disc did n't have as much trouble playing in our actual dvd player once we were back in the states but still skipped from time to time overall show rating 5 stars overall disc rating 3 stars ||| 1
dark atmospheric telling of the tale very decent ! it is a simply told ancient tale the scenery is gorgeous there 's a good atmosphere of the barbaric time it 's a good movie a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end the movie conjures up thoughts of gerard butler as aragorn and ingvar eggert as theodin in lotr ||| 1
i loved this movie for those who gave it one star i guess didnt see how well it was done in the american version all it sarah michelle gellar 's face the japanese version was much better considering it was original and made more sense it has alot of characters in it but not so much that u will get lost in all of them since they usually die or just dont appear until later in the has some twists which are american leaves out soo sooo much in the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people in the japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves asian horror and likes a good plot and movie ! ! go see it ! ! and enjoy ||| 1
this film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it the plot is not very intriguing and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life so it lacks this sense of reality a dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer which is exactly the point of this movie however this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute elijah wood is stunning only due to his efforts can the film get some believability caulkin is perfect in this role too portraying the bad boy i have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor maybe only comparing to elijah but hey he is widely consirered as one of the most talanted actors of his generation and the most talanted holywood child star ever so no wonder you can not compete with him anyway this film is certainly worth watching as a family entertainment and is absolutely a must for elijah wood fans ! ||| 1
in all fairness this film is advertized on the package as a docudrama '' and not as a drama the problem is that it is n't clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its anniversary as a documentary about the reenactment this is a fine collection of footage interspersed with some thankfully brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides actually i thought the actor portraying longstreet did a fine job the others were less convincing as a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle as a reenactor i found it interesting watching the various units on the field despite the occassional glimpse of earplugs and sunglasses the equipment and uniforms appear reasonably authentic of course given the generous build of most of the reenactors in this film the title should have been three days of density '' instead i kid my fellow reenactors unfortunately most people who have the money to spend on reenacting also have too much money to spend on good food and drink myself included so if you want to really learn about the battle read harry pfanz 's trilogy or stephen sears ' book if you want to see what civil war reenacting on a grand scale can be like this is a fine introduction ||| 1
watching once and again '' is one of the most painful television shows to watch let along watch again this is not because it is a bad television show but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date i would like to be able to identify with rick but my personal situation is more like that of jake and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults i keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them watching once and again the complete second season '' on dvd the character i found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on abc was that of zoe manning there is a moment when she reads her parents lily and jake the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister grace but also ending up with less years where the family scribbling rivalry '' anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again if you have been spared that particular experience then i really do not know why you would want what these people go through if the first season of once and again '' is about lily manning and rick sammler falling in love then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and to a new level of acceptance there is actually more abut lily and her new job scribbling rivalry '' and rick working on a for miles drentell edifice wrecked '' than there is about them being with each other while lily and rick are happy for the most part everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again feast or famine '' the major irony is that the dyad i am most interested in is karen and jessie especially knowing what is going to happen to karen in the third season and what evan rachel wood has done since this show ended although i am equally impressed by julie whalen as a young actress as well so i tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing albeit for different reasons but with more of an appreciation of how jessie is her mother 's daughter which is not always a good thing best of enemies '' especially since jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating food for thought '' having miles drentel is a mixed blessing because while watching david clennon is always a pleasure when he becomes a wedge between rick and david it is like watching michael and elliot on thirtysomething '' all over again but it does inspire a true moment of vision for rick ozymandias 2.0 '' and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having miles around is to bring rick down to the point that all he can offer lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot this becomes important because it means rick and lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe let alone live but dramatically the whole bit of karen and her law firm trying to stop miles and rick from building their project is more interesting edifice wrecked '' especially when it seems rick might end up going to prison wo n't someone please help george bailey tonight '' when the psychiatrist that jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as rick and karen get at each other it seems so obvious this really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun the other end of the telescope '' but bails on tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby forgive us out trespasses '' judy comes up with the great idea of booklovers '' despite lily 's negativity but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out will gluck eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music i ca n't stand up for falling down '' but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue note why rick and karen wasted time letting eli apply to the university of illinois at is beyond me because i have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this december i have to tell you that unless eli is going on a basketball scholarship he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation so my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into eli 's parents or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation my only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that lily is really way too judgmental at least when she does not immediately accept rick 's proposal another painfully true moment for me she does not leave him hanging for long and i liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring the fact that season two ends with the wedding the second time around '' might seem like the end of the story but only if you make the mistake of thinking once and again '' was simply about lily getting remarried it really is about trying to make two families one which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final and incomplete season to come out on dvd ||| 1
this was a blast from the past for my husband and we purchased this for our 6 and 7 year olds and they really like it it fits right where they are in school and they laugh while they are learning often when we are doing homework i 'll say that 's what they said on the electric company '' or remember what the electric company said this letters sound like '' and they do it 's been a joy to see something from my childhood work for them it 's great to play in the morning while they are getting ready for school plus i have to admit seeing morgan freeman and bill cosby in this is quite hilarious mistakes and all ! ||| 1
using the summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed at least to me like a recipe for disaster but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by bill nighy the girl in the cafe is an unexpected gem do n't miss it ||| 1
this is a very enjoyable film about the music and spirit of one of our greatest rock musicians i love neil young 's music and i love this film ||| 1
i went into this dvd with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it maybe enjoy '' is n't the right word it is intense it is political and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics and it jumps around from subplot to subplot in fact i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks but i found it very plausible and that is what a good movie should give a plausible thesis and play it out it succeeds here it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence sure it makes the gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them but that usually makes for a good starting point since most large organizations usually succumb to fear greed anyway i once heard a history professor say it is n't about the struggle of good vs evil it is always about the struggle of good vs good sides always think they are right and god is on their side '' watch it you will come out the other side thinking ||| 1
this was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all it was a very sad day when the election was stolen from gore but this movie gave me a new realization that being in office would have held this man back his talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious this is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes he gives a website for more ideas and info if you think this might be too boring for your taste give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish thank you gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen ||| 1
i thought this movie was pretty good i 've seen a lot of nicholas cage movies the rock con air etc so maybe i am biased towards him i 've watched this movie 3 times and it does n't wear thin too quick like some movies ||| 1
i enjoyed ice age and this movie is good as well thankfully all of the cast from the original ice age returned and the comedy as well and besides the characters the story is another original idea and a great stand alone movie by itself and thankfully not a rehasing of an old one the ice age is coming to an end and our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for higher ground before their valley gets flooded manny along the way begins to question his own mortality and the fact that he is the last mammoth '' or is he well that what everybody thinks until they run across a family of opossums do n't see how opossums and mammoths tie together just watch the movie queen latifah was a good addition to the cast great film one for the collection ||| 1

wonderful terry gilliam is the orson welles of our time lambasted by critics for his excesses admired by others for his genius i 'm with the genius crowd brothers grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie i 've seen in a long while gilliam 's style is baroque and by a director who knows the definition visually this can be quite stunning as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene sort of like a durer woodcut as imagined by hieronymus bosch and the brothers grimm is perfect ground for gilliam 's magic a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas it 's 1812 the age of napoleon not a good time for the imagination nevertheless jake will grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear since it 's also an age of anxiety and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night the bumbling grimms are played quite effectively by matt damon who pulls off the accent nicely and heath ledger a head scratching success their evil counterparts end products from the age of reason are a french general played by jonathan pryce and his wacky henchman played by the always wonderful peter stormare little girls are disappearing in a small town and something needs to be done about it and the grimms are caught in the middle you will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales as the grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery to reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises check it out ||| 1
monk '' is quite an interesting show it is about this character named adrian monk played by tony shalhoub wings '' who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias he is also incredibly intelligent he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly provided that he has all the right clues the most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words which for some of the most intense cases will really shock the audience i 've solved the case '' however for some reason the best part always seems to be when he says here 's what happened '' when it comes to the scenes involving murder cases it must be known that the antagonists of some episodes can get very very brutal they will do things like whack people against the head with crowbars slice up their bodies with chainsaws smash their hands with car doors and sometimes they will even try drowning them and like the antagonists of macgyver '' they are not afraid to use guns if necessary the acting is phenomenal especially by tony shalhoub and ted levine capt stottelmeyer the photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene in each episode finally this dvd is practically perfect in picture and sound quality it has extras like featurettes and you have the option of listening to it in three different languages english spanish and french i found it all interesting in conclusion this tv show has it all good background music great dialogue interesting stories good acting and interesting cinematography the kab score 8.9 super ||| 1
i did not see john carpenter 's original version of assault on precinct 13 '' but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake i was paying attention so i knew what the set up was both inside and out of the precinct as we went along but being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in james demonaco 's script i made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters i was sure would survive all the bullets and i was which is a polite way of saying i was it is new year 's eve in richet 's film and it has started to snow heavily precinct 13 officially closes at the stroke of midnight and filling up the last boxes are sergeant jake roenick ethan hawke who has been hiding behind a desk ever since an undercover gig went horribly bad and he was wounded while his two partners were killed grizzled veteran jasper o'shea brian dennehy who is always talking about retirement and secretary iris ferry drea de matteo who is always talking about sex with bad boys jake would rather talk about sex than his feelings about what happened before with alex sabian mario bello the department shrink who happens to stop by on a snowy new year 's eve to take another crack at jake 's psyche then a detroit police transport bus shows up with a quartet of prisoners unable to get to the prison because of the storm and a highway accident there is beck john leguizamo who will not shut up anna alisha hinds a girl with a who proclaims her innocence smiley ja rule a counterfeiter and marion bishop laurence fishburne the most notorious criminal in the city who has just been arrested for murdering an undercover cop under suspicious circumstances so when a couple of guys with guns break into the precinct and everybody is yelling these are bishop 's men coming to get get we do not buy it after all as soon as bishop saw them he hid behind a wall things are just beginning to get interesting assault on precinct 13 '' is an action film where the human element is really more interesting once jake figures out that to survive the night he needs everybody to help out which means not only the prisoners but the women everybody gets a gun in this one but you know full well that not everybody can be trusted with one furthermore jake is fully aware that bishop is the smartest and deadliest person there but this movie is all about making the best of a bad situation that keeps getting worse the death of one character really puts the way this is going to play out into question and i liked the note on which the film actually ends once we finally get down to the inevitable confrontation between the two main characters not great but certainly an enjoyable action picture with a minimum amount of stupidity on the part of the characters once you accept the idea the die is cast and it is all or nothing for the bad guys that is a pretty good recommendation for this genre ||| 1
maybe better than the original i liked that they focused on wonka 's childhood throughout the film that was something that really added to the storyline they really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal too i guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original was n't anywhere to be seen in this one but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it oh and the children seemed especially bratty this time which made it better when those bad things happened to them a friend pointed out to me that this version has a lot more musical numbers good call i do n't know if the ending was better than the original but it was certainly a very good interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake i do n't want to reveal what happens at the end so let 's just say that when the factory tour is over and charlie leaves there 's still a decent chunk of storyline left i was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of living in a world of chocolate '' element was n't really there which is definitely a bad thing i mean come on we all want a world of chocolate ! i just feel there should have been more things included in the film overall it 's probably not better than the original but it 's not worse either you really need to own both ||| 1
having seen stella 's live show in hollywood i had a sneaking suspicion that i was going to love their comedy central show and i was not disappointed these guys have mastered the art of and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end i guess i 'm not surprised it did n't last this kind of humor is n't for everyone but come on we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include mind of mencia and blue collar comedy both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer these guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years and i hope to see them in another show or movie soon until then i 'll be enjoying stella on dvd ||| 1
that is really what said when they took this the funniest show ever on off the air in less than six shows my friends in high school and i watchedcthis show every time it came on it was a parrody of all the cop shows from the 60 's and 70 's and was falling down funny later the group who gave us airplane would retool their baby into the naked gun '' movies and make a mint at the boxoffice each show could be watched many times just to catch the jokes you missed i 'm so happy that they have all six shows on dvd now and i can get rid of the old cut up copy that i had on vhs and remember smoke '' yes i know but what happened ||| 1

stagecoach '' is significant along with destry rides again '' for redefining the western for adult '' audiences director john ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences for sure the film does contain a number of western archetypes the gambler the prostitute with a heart of gold etc but they transcend the stereotypes stagecoach '' is also significant as the film that broke john wayne to mainstream audiences wayne 's entrance as the ringo kid is the stuff of legends there is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated claire trevor as the social pariah dallas and thomas mitchell as doc boone for which he won an oscar the film 's status as being historically significant is not debatable as first class entertainment it is timeless ||| 1
i watched this movie and once it finished i decided i had to log on to amazon and buy it up this film is so well done from the characters the actors the dialogue and the stories a pure enjoyment to watch i hope everyuone sees it at least once ||| 1
this film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted occasionally the film lets itself down with it 's editing i sometimes feel disorientated thinking wait slow down will you '' having said that this film is well acted and really puts you in the netherlands of the century it may not be as hard hitting and exciting as turkish delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching ||| 1
i love good underrated movies they make you feel like you 're part of a priviledge club of connoisseurs i 'm not a movie buff but deep cover has all the elements you would expect of a classic great acting memorable lines interesting and logical plot and a decent ending laurence fishburne is at his best in his role of an undercover cop slowly crossing the line between pretending to be a drug dealer and pretending to be a cop jeff golblum is one of those actors you either love or hate and i loved him playing the dirty lawyer laundering drug money there 's a great chemistry between the two and the supporting cast which to me was one of the main weakness of new jack city the use of laurence fishburne 's character as the narrator works wonder and somewhere between the slow dark wailings of the movie theme the nightime shots of downtown la and laurence fishburn 's poetic lines the movie grabs you into a world an urban jungle crowded with nightime vultures heartless killers and hopeless junkies deep cover is somewhere between fables and magical realism a place where reality exceeds fiction a great movie the dvd is so so almost no extras and the picture quality is good without being great ||| 1
where do i start jack nicolson is a magnificant actor he can play anybody and his performance in this film was top notch i recomend anyone that claims to be a fan of his to check this film out i guarantee you will be satisfied ||| 1
2002 the first film 2 2004 the second film introduction in 2002 the first of the hit theatres it 's not likely that the film 's director sam raimi had any idea just how successful his incarnation of the classic superhero would be it drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres and the dvd releases did the same the sequel appropriately enough was even more hyped and did even better and now both films have been combined into a single set ! read on for my review of the films storyline essentially this set includes both of the films the first of the two films explains how peter parker got bitten by a radioactive spider and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into in the first film the villain is former head of oscorp norman osborn who has been transformed into the green goblin by a chemical he was testing the second film continues two years after the first left off and features facing off against doc ock a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body this time around juggling the duties of being with work and school have made peter parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle opinions both of these films rule seeing the first film turned me into a fan practically overnight the acting and storyline are both excellent particuarly willem dafoe 's portrayal of norman green goblin everything the first film did well the second one does even better i was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them but sam raimi does it here these are great films and the fact that they 're together in one package only sweetens the deal dvd these are the standard dvd releases of the film meaning each one has a bonus disc of material there are a ton of bonus features including commentary cast and crew interviews and assorted other extras too the second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books and the plotlines of them ! that 's my favorite extra on either of the discs the other features are also excellent and if you like the films you 'll agree they 're worthwhile overall i ca n't begin to express my satisfaction with these films the cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece and i think you 'll agree superhero movies do n't get any better being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet these are movies regardless of who you are even if you 're not a big fan of the franchise you may be pleasantly surprised ||| 1
i saw this movie for the first time when i was 5. i 'm still watching it at 65. they will never be another movie to surpass this one ||| 1
the movie was terrific and the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars was because there was quite a bit of spanish in the film and the subtites from spanish to english did n't seem to work on my copy english subtitles appeared for engliish and spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke spanish ! strange fortunately i know some spanish so i could sort of pick it up but i do n't know why the sub titles did n't work anyway bogie was very good and the story was too three men set out to find gold and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey besides all that were the usual bandits and indians and so forth but it kept you watching and that 's what really counts wo n't tell you if they got any gold ! ||| 1

the legend of zelda complete animated series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children 's cartoon should be right there with teenage mutant ninja turtles '' street sharks '' and recess '' the legend of zelda was and still is such an exceptional video game series for all ages and the tv show followed in its footsteps it combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy and some jokes that still today make me laugh lookin ' good princess ! 'specially from this angle ! '' as children we see link yell that to zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences but later that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee and wonder how we ever missed it before but the series is most enjoyable for those of us who faithfully stuck to the actual video game series the implimentation of original sound effects into the cartoon is an added bonus that draws us back for more and waiting to see which classic zelda enemy will cause link and zelda trouble next is just that much more fun especially if you can name them but by far the most fun thing about this show is waiting and praying for the day when link can coax a kiss out of the lovely princess and they 've come so close it almost made me angry when they got interrupted link tries so hard and makes such an idiot out of himself trying that you 'd think he deserves a little action once in a while but every time no matter how he tries he either messes up or is interrupted by ganon 's attempts to steal the triforce all in all if you grew up with te super mario super show and you 're a nintendo fan you 'll appreciate this show as much as you love to watch it ||| 1
this is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor i really enjoyed watching it i think it has great replay value as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness i found it more reminiscent of the old 60 's films like 'monte carlo or bust ' or 'those magnificent men ' jackie chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the foil to 'fillius fogg ' played with brilliant english reserve humor by 'steve coogan ' there 's no comparison to the original the film does n't even try to copy rather it takes a silly story with silly character 's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family movies you 'll see because this is n't a typical 'martial arts ' vehicle for 'jackie chan ' i found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline check out for instance the in the which goes to show why 'jackie chan ' is probably the best star in the world right now there 's much that 's in his performance all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts the are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices most notably 'it 's a mad mad mad mad world ' what i think is the best comedy ever this is by no means a comparison anyway 'arnold swarzenneger ' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a turkish prince no less possibly the poorest arabian impression ever which is of course why it works so well and 'rob schneider ' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice miss 'cecile de france ' is a beautiful comedy foil manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent i hope to see more from her you might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but i found a lot of it to be nicely restrained this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set check out the extras all in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing ||| 1
the main character lebowski is a bum of a person living in los angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by john goodman and steve buscemi suddenly lebowski 's life is changed when he is mistaken for another lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters the plot evolves as many other coen movies raising arizona comes to mind as we are introduced to colorful characters and the plot gets outrageous yet somehow still seems real my favorite component of this film is the character played by john goodman a polish veteran who converted to judaism after marrying his he has a plan to help lebowski extricate himself from the mess and he does n't bowl on shabbos he also his 's pomeranian when she goes out of town if you liked raising arizona you 'll want to watch this movie over and over again ||| 1

made some of the most loved films of all time and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making of all time these fellows bought you the cult favourite blood simple the hillarious raising arizona the decietful millers crossing the crazy barton fink the hudsuckers proxy and the blood drenched fargo and now this one of the finest films they 've done the big lebowski jeff bridges is jeffery lebowski or in this case the dude john goodman plays the vietnam veteran walter steve buscemi is not in it too often but he plays the loveable donnie let 's just go through the character sketches only the dude 's bowling pals characters the big lebowski 's main character is the dude he lives in la he listens to creedance clearwater revival his favourite drink is a white russian and he loves bowling the film is set in as we 've established before los angeles the dude is an average joe slacker who dresses in as what you could say 'the hippie who likes to surf clothing ' sandals shorts crummy old shirts jersey jackets jackets that are jerseys he never wears socks with his shoes even in bowling shoes and occasionly glasses let 's also not forget his long hair that makes the dude 's image so legandary the dude 's bowling buddies are walter sobchak and donny walter is a vitnam veteran and refers everything to nam ' he mostly wears shorts a shirt with a sleeveless jacket hiking shoes socks obviously and always and i mean always wears his aviator sun glasses he also has sort of an army man buzz cut with a beard around his mouth donny is a great bowler whenever we see him bowl he gets a strike except for once later on do n't want to spoil anything that 's all we bassicly know about him except that he usually when bowling wears long pants a bowling shirt tucked in and a haircut where is hair is n't too long or too short he 's a nice guy and is usually told to shut up by walter because of his late involvement in conversations with the dude and walter the plot the movie kicks off with a man narrating he has a texan accent and talks about a man named jeffery lebowski who also goes by the name 'the dude ' and is the supposed storyteller of the dude 's story but does n't narrate until later on as he narrates we see the dude in a grocery store in his sandals and the previous statements i made of the clothes he wears he 's looking at milk and tests one of them to see if it 's sour he later arrives home with his purchased milk but is surprised by two thugs they dunk his head in the toilet and are telling him to give them the money that bunny owes them they later realise that it 's not the jeffery lebowski they 're after they 've soiled the dude 's rug and they eventually leave but the dude wants to get to the man who they were supposed to get this is the other jeffery lebowski i was talking about and is the millionaire lebowski he 's bassicly the title 's name the big lebowski '' the dude pitches up at the millionaire 's mansion and attempts to get a free carpet in exchange for what the thugs were supposed to do to the big lebowski 's carpet he eventually get 's what he wants but is then later called by jeffery lebowski to drop off money to kidnappers who kidnapped his trophy wife bunny to cut this short the film is about the dude trying to get bunny back to jeffery lebowski and how he has to deal with other problems that jeffery lebowski has because people come looking after him because of the same name he shares with the millionaire lebowski the drop off of the kidnapping leads to all of his other problems walter is told about the ransom money by the dude and decides that the dude and himself should keep the money instead because walter thinks that bunny kidnapped herself walter gives the kidnappers a bag full of dirty laundry that he had so they keep the money in the car when they go bowling as they come out his car is gone so they have to get the money back without jeffery lebowski knowing the film is hilarious but that does n't mean that it 's just a normal movie it 's stunnig the dialogue is sharp and witty although there 's alot of swearing that does n't mean the humour is just fowl mouthed it 's hillarious some of the lines go down in history as some of the funniest one liners ever the coen 's writing here is as good as ever with excelently written and thought out characters jeff bridges and john goodman are absolutely hilarious they 're definately the funniest characters in this movie jesus is also funny and make you wish the film would never end the other things that are worth watching the film for are the acid trip sequences and the absolutely incredible vintage rock soundtrack this is a comedy lover 's dream come true if you love the coens and excellent snappy humour then this is a must have for you even you do n't know the coens too well or even comedy then here 's a film too start with just buy this now or soon or whenever you have a split second of a chance to buy it i ca n't tell you what the special features are on this disc because i have the region 2 edition this one most probably has the same trailer my one has so if it 's the same as the region 2 features then it 's got absolutely no good special features worth writing about ||| 1
i was a teenager in the 80 's so i love all of the old 80 's teen movies but some kind of wonderful makes my top three the performances were believable the actors became the characters not the other way around eric stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks literally who wants to pursue art instead of business mary stuart masterson is his best friend a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him lea thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty and her boyfriend craig scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend and the only off note keith eric stoltz is interested in amanda lea thompson and takes the opportunity to ask her out when she breaks up with her boyfriend to spite the boyfriend she says yes watts mary stuart masterson predicts trouble and their friendship is tested my favorite line from the movie is when keith defends amanda claiming you ca n't judge a book by its cover '' watts cynically replies yeah but you can tell how much it 's gon na cost '' finally watts agrees to help keith prepare for the date including helping him practice kissing '' and it 's a doozy of a kiss throw in john ashton as keith 's father maddie corman as his meddlesome sister and elias koteas as the scary guy keith befriends in detention and you have a wonderful '' movie ||| 1
based on historical events which are still poorly undertsood this movie depicts werner heisenberg and niels bohr the titans of quantum mechanics in its halcyon days during the and caught in an encounter which is a loose human analogy to heisenberg 's famous uncertainty principle which demonstrates mathematically that you can not know both the exact speed and position of a single electron drawing from the tony play by michael frayn who also wrote noises off the movie revolves around the dialogue between these two men sometimes together with bohr 's wife who meet in copenhagen in 1942 when heisenberg the german who has been placed within the scientific research progam of the nazis in their quest to build a nuclear bomb visits his mentor and colleague bohr the dane who is living through nazi occupation of his native land there are deep unresolved questions about the motives of heisenberg which the characters try to resolve in a series of talks and walks through the same park where the two physicists previoulsy stolled to debate the ideas which came to form the foundation of quantum physics set against a piano score which resonates with the inner sense of uncertainty and suspicion in the dialogue the movie achieves some the things that the big stage does not allow including flashbacks and scenes ranging back and forth between the park and bohr 's home note i enjoyed the movie as much as the play in an era where cinematic palates seem titillated mostly by fast action thrillers this movie is another example of how well constructed dialogue makes for gripping cinematic drama when it goes hand in hand with superb casting and performance ||| 1
i enjoyed the first season and got it eagerly awaiting season 2. see it for sale overseas in the uk but not here tough waiting so long sigh i can do other formats besides north america but it 's a pain c'mon guys i 'd rather spend the money here ||| 1
the grapes of wrath is a great movie perhaps one of the best i have ever seen however having read the book i notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out by taking out these crucial yet quiet scenes the movie has a faster pace than the book in the movie grandpa died suddenly the only explanation for his death was that he had a stroke in the book the preacher casy explained to the family members that the old man could not leave his land his home and his way of life casy explained that grandpa was spiritually dead when he left his house and it did not take long for his body to also die this shows the great sacrifice that the joads must make in order to survive in the movie it just seems that they pack up leave and arrive without any moral dilemmas grandpa dies in another family 's tent not just on a blanket by the road this is important because in the book it symbolizes the way people have to help one another in times of need in the scenes in california the pace slows down a bit so i can feel the details of the book surface in the movie with the events leading up to casy 's death crisp and clear i could understand his death as brutal murder and tom 's speech about him carrying on casy 's work beautifully taken from the book i really loved these scenes because unlike most of the movie these scenes do remain true to the book and because of that they are full of detail and you can see the hand of steinbeck at work despite all of these forgotten scenes the grapes of wrath is one of the best movies of all time ||| 1
why does title always seem to be ommitted from any bond collection release connery in a remake of thunderball is this not a relesae by the same production company it is a mgm release so why does n't it ever get included any light that can be shed would be greatly ||| 1
there simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than frank gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work he has both his passionate lovers and haters i am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle i really love some of his work while i find some of his work to be quite off putting the person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of gehry 's work art critic claude jencks the person who popularized the term postmodern '' jencks for whose deceased wife gehry designed a memorial building states bluntly that gehry has made some ugly buildings i think with gehry more than most architects one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition whatever else one may say about gehry he is n't like other architects one reviewer below called this a puff piece '' but that is n't really correct it is more correct to call it a conversation with a friend gehry asked his close friend the mainstream director sydney pollack to make a documentary of his work the result is a fine portrait of gehry 's career pollack certainly does not criticize his work but interestingly he does not over praise it either they do call attention to the fact that many simply do n't like his work and the film contains numerous excerpts from one of gehry 's more vociferous and respected critics hal foster but the point of the film is not to provide an objective and critical overview of frank gehry 's work the point is to get to know frank gehry and some of his ideas about architecture in this the film succeeds marvelously if one watches a number of documentaries about architects one thing that is striking is how many of them are enormously likable individuals for every irascible frank lloyd wright there are ten you 'd love to sit down and have a beer with much like pei frank gehry comes across as an immensely likable guy in this film perhaps away from his friend 's camera he is an implacable tyrant but those qualities if they exist are not apparent here instead he comes across as a genuinely nice guy in fact a couple of the individuals interviewed stress that as laid back as gehry is he really does have an ego i do n't think i 've ever heard a person in the creative field have anyone insist that appearance aside they really do have an ego in the vast majority of cases that is all too apparent i found it interesting to see the shots of gehry and either of his design partners working with him on designs if you are accustomed to think of architecture as akin to drafting watching gehry work is a bit of a shock he does n't design so much as sculpt he and his partners look like a couple of extremely mature kindergartners with scissors and paper as they cut bend shape snip and play with variations on the model they are struggling with there is apparently little or no concern with the particular materials to be used he seems rather to struggle with the kind of overall shape with the assumption that with today 's materials any kind of design can be turned into a reality the film really brings out how gehry 's own conception of architecture is much closer to sculpture than to engineering as a resident of chicago a city noted for his importance to twentieth century architecture it has been amazing to realize how little of his work has been done here in fact apart from his controversial what else work in millennium park i 'm not aware of anything else he has done here as a result i have less direct experience with gehry 's work than many other leading architects i must confess that much of what i see appears to be fascinating i would for instance absolutely love to see his bilbao museum but there is one aspect to gehry 's work that i really applaud its emphasis on individualism one criticism of much architecture has been its essential conservativism much of it espouses nonegalitarian and conformist values one sees exceptions such as louis sullivan 's refusal to put box seats in his chicago auditorium design if one looks at a gehry design it is hard to imagine it ever becoming the style of choice of a repressionistic totalitarian regime it is too individualistic too anarchic for that even such a free spirit as louis kahn still designed the capitol of bangladesh but it is simply impossible to imagine frank gehry designing a capitol i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i came away from it with a greater liking for frank gehry as a person than i had anticipated and perhaps i will in the future be more inclined to appreciate his designs he may not be the greatest of our architects but he certainly is one of our more likable free spirits ||| 1

warner has been doing a magnificent job of using the latest picture resolution process to restore polish up their best movies and again they do not disappoint ! warner home video truly hits a home run and does the incredible with this boxed set of five of the greatest musicals of all time ! the set is well presented with excellent digital transfer wonderful sound and a bevy of sublime extras the band wagon which itself is a two dvd special edition stars fred astaire as an older entertainer trying to be successful again in show business things do not go well he does n't like the director there are n't fancy dance scenes that he prefers to perform and he has to dance with a ballerina ! the show is unpopular and fred 's character tony hunter saves the day using his superior technique and the extras are wonderful ! liza minnelli whose dad vincente minnelli did an excellent job as director of the picture and michael feinstein provide an engaging commentary there are also two documentaries get aboard ! the band wagon '' about the making of the movie and an older expose entitled the men who made the movies vincente minnelli '' you wo n't regret are excellent and very informative ! smile there 's also the outtake musical number of two faced women very good ! for astaire fans there 's an astaire trailer collection and even a musical short of jack buchanan with the glee quartet i was particularly pleased with the fine commentary liza minnelli and michael feinstein give here the other two disc special edition is of the mgm classic easter parade wow ! this has always been one of my very favorite musicals the acting and the chemistry between astaire playing the professional dancer and judy garland playing hannah brown his at first unlikely dance eventually romantic nothing short of excellent and captivating ! ann miller turns in a great performance as the dancer who leaves fred 's character to try to get even further ahead in her career the digital quality of the video and the sound are both excellent there 's a documentary of the making of this movie and a particular favorite of mine is the american masters documentary profile judy garland by myself '' put out only with the essential effort of my friend john fricke the american masters documentary won more than just one emmy making this a particularly valuable extra ! john won one of the emmys for this he is the leading garland biographer who wrote several books on judy john worked so hard on this profile ! john 's fine commentary along with ava astaire fred astaire 's daughter proves to be an excellent resource for reliable information about this film and judy you also get the outtake musical number mr monotony '' there 's a judy garland trailer collection and some promotions for the original film are provided wow ! a fine two disc set in and of itself bells are ringing is judy holliday 's last performance she plays a worker at a telephone answering service who gets overly involved with her client 's personal lives jean stapleton a favorite actress of mine from all in the family as edith is in this picture as well this picture was nominated for an oscar for best scoring of a musical picture and the song just in time '' is certainly one good reason why ! outtake musical numbers include is it a crime '' and my guiding star '' the digital transfer is again excellent and the sound quality is excellent this is definitely a classic musical brigadoon boasts a wonderful musical score by lerner and lowe the principle cast is only the best gene kelly van johnson and cyd charisse an adventurous american suddenly uncovers a magical scottish town which is only visible one day a century ! does he stay there and perhaps experience a fine true love or should he return to his life as it is quite the dilemma ! there are three musical outtakes you want to look at come to me bend to me '' from this day on '' and sword dance '' an audio outtake and a brand new digital transfer make this a fine addition to the box set as well as your dvd collection last but certainly not least is finian 's rainbow a wonderful fanciful musical this film stars fred astaire in his final full length performance as finian mclonergan somehow finian steals a pot of gold from og the leprechaun finian and his daughter sharon the lovely petula clark go to america as does og and use their powers to overcome a rather prejudiced senator not only are the musical numbers excellent the cinematography is superlative and the ending is a happy one ! there is an excellent commentary by director francis ford coppola and a cute feature on the film 's premiere all in all this is clearly one of the best boxed sets of supremely fine great musicals and it is very reasonably priced for me personally this set was an easy is already in my personal dvd collection ! i highly recommend this boxed set for fans of the great american musicals as well as all patrons of the arts this is also a solid introduction to some of the quality musicals produced on film to date equally important the hard work and effort everyone put into the seemingly countless extras is superlative ||| 1
the great dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director charlie chaplin the movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of world war 2 and at the rise of the nazi party the similarities between dictator adolf hitler and the comedic genius that is charlie chaplin is quite interesting both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year same month in the same week chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing hitler for this film he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film the great dictator has the ability to tug at your heart and make you laugh until you cry the music is gorgeous and the writing is superb though some scenes do drag a bit most of it flows smoothly perhaps the most famous scene in the movie is the final speech given by chaplin it is just him staring at the camera and nothing stops him from saying what he feels movie buffs have to see this film the great dictator is a beautiful presentation that showcases the cinema genius of charlie chaplin ||| 1
every film in this collection is a gem annie hall and manhattan are both top notch followed by bananas everything you wanted to know about sex sleeper heck even interiors was such a radical departure its worth seeing at least once or twice but to me the real diamonds in the rough of this set are stardust memories and love and death these two films are probably woody 's least talked about but really i think they are both fantastic films love and death is full of the witty one liners and pratfalls that were prevelant in his earlier funnier '' works but you can see in the dialogue of love and death that woody was maturing and stardust memories my favorite woody film this film says so much for anyone who fancies themselves an artist '' who is trying to figure out what they want to say and how to say it maybe my one beef is the lack of extras on these dvd 's but for the money you ca n't beat the price of this set ||| 1
these movies are beautiful and intense one of those you must watch and enjo ||| 1
if you 're looking for a silly movie with no content this is not a collection for you the series is a great insight to a range of human emotions and finding your true self i recommend it to anybody who loves good movies just beware this set has english subtitles so if you do n't like that you can think twice before commiting to a purchase ||| 1
i like it a whole lot but pretty good ! i liked the older elmo movies better than this one ||| 1

i 'm not one to go in length about films on amazon but i 'll write a short little bit for this amazing film i first saw this 10 years ago when i was in my teens and have never forgotten it it really touched something inside of me much like a great piece of art would affect you after seeing it up close for the first time ||| 1
hal hartley never fails to entertain never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level simple men is no exception the seemingly simple plot two brothers in search of their missing dad provides so much room for character growth that i wish there were an entire series of films centered around them with a view of the world as there 's no such thing as adventure there 's no such thing as romance there 's only trouble and desire '' actually from a fritz lang movie of the 1920 's there 's plenty going on to both prove and disprove hartley 's ambivalent theories simple men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious elena lwensohn in one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50 's dance to sonic youth 's kool thing '' then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number many dismiss this film and hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point what is amazing about hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that once seen reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane simple men is pure cinematic delight hooray for hartley ||| 1
not being familiar with yoga i chose this dvd because of rodney yee 's reputation and the low cost what i found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed and yet energized after the first session there are no bells or whistles just a great workout i 've purchases two other titles in the series power yoga strength and power yoga stamina and i switch off each workout some of the moves are more difficult than others but it gives you something to work up to if i could n't do a stretch i would go as far as i could and hold it it was a great feeling when i was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly i was unable to do aside from these video 's the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain i do know this for a fact ||| 1

when daryl deever william hurt tells tv reporter tony sokolow sigourney weaver he knows more than he actually does about a murder in the building where he works as a janitor he gets more than he bargained for deever is a good guy smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms he 's sort of engaged to his best friend 's sister but he 's had a crush on sokolow for two years when the man in the building gets his throat slit sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her so he tells her he may know something she goes after the story and he goes after her sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated capable man known as joseph christopher plummer who is good friends with sokolow 's parents it becomes clear that her wealthy parents their rich friends and joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for jews to escape from the soviet union and to journey to israel and it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement too before long the man 's associates learn of deever 's gambit with sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing more lethally the real murderer learns of what deever said to sokolow and believes deever might actually know something he goes after deever this is a tight well constructed murder mystery with two components first is the romance which builds between the characters played by hurt and weaver these two people are attractive and smart hurt in particular comes across as guileless but he 's no one 's patsy the two are very likable second the situation which develops poses some ethical questions grades of gray come into play it would n't be accurate to say that the murderer is simply another bad guy the movie also features some actors besides hurt and weaver there 's christopher plummer who as usual brings so much assurance and nuance to his role james woods as the best friend always a little off balance pamela reed as woods ' sister her mutual declaration of with hurt is very funny and appealing steven hill and morgan freeman as the two cops assigned to the case kenneth mcmillan as hurt 's father angry and vulnerable and irene worth and albert paulsen as weaver 's parents people who love her but especially the mother always put responsibilities and obligations into the love they all are very good i like this movie a lot the dvd picture looks fine there are no extras to speak of ||| 1
most people have a hard time adjusting to foreign films because reading subtitles and trying to watch the film is difficult that 's why i love melville 's le samourai not much speaking throughout the film equals minimal subtitles this film does n't require many lines of speech the main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect while trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him my first melville film and i loved it if you like this one you should also see le cercle rouge and especially bob le flambeur ||| 1
there is n't one wasted second in this film not one ! ! ! you 'll be sucked in and surprised within the first two minutes and there 's very little dialogue so you need not worry about too much subtitle reading you can tell there 's a lot of influence from american film noir in this film but le samourai '' takes it to a level of perfection i wish some of the folks that throw their good money towards bad modern action flicks would take the time to watch le samourai '' they just might discover a thing or two about how it could really be done brilliant ||| 1
spoilers when star trek 's production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold the cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode the result one of the most important and brilliant treks ever done ! everyone knows the basic plot by now spock kidnaps his crippled former captain and hijacks the enterprise and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all the federation he eventually is en route and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the enterprise 's visit to talos iv 13 years prior this is the episode which cements spock 's character forever the supposedly emotionless vulcan who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans leonard nimoy 's performance is one of his best as spock initially seeming as though spock had gone crazy almost kidnapping pike using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under 'secret orders ' all sorts of indications something must be wrong with spock until after the talosian 's plan is revealed where it is found they have been manipulating events all along and spock returns to his stoic self leaving the briefing room with pike for the last time his head bowed shoulders slumped shatner 's understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles i say 'unfair ' frankly it is perfect for the events all during these events kirk acts rather stunned at all these events his friend and officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship he almost dies going after him in a shutle then he is releived of command for all of this ! by the time the talosians supposedly abandon spock and forces the trial board to take a vote even kirk is convinced spock should be put the able to smile when the talosian shows him the 'rejuvenated ' pike happy again at last all of these performances are directed with care by marc daniels the veteran tv director who was at the helm of the 'envelope ' they make an deliberate point of cutting to the more mature unemotional spock during the famous 'laughing ' scene and you can almost see a flicker of 'was i that emotional ' cross his face ! the makeup used on sean kenney the 'substitute ' captain pike jeffery hunter was unavailable might be some of the best ever done for any trek it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage you are totally convinced this is an older horribly maimed jeffrey hunter ! some small parts of the cage are cut some shots of pike 's fellow ' some very sexist lines about 'women on the bridge ' and the obligatory 'aliens running through the computer ' scene none of these are very important to the plot of either the pilot or the envelope and just to add some trivia part ii of the menagerie was the highest rated episode of star trek ever in prime time ! actor malachi throne had been the original voice of the talosian keeper in the pilot since he was cast as commodore mendez voice artist vic perrin was dubbed in as the keeper as per the director 's guild marc daniels was credited as director for part i while the director of the cage robert mr pilot butler was given the screen credit for part ii the menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish ! ||| 1

what a truly stunning film this type of film has been long overdue in the movie industry more of these should see the light ||| 1
this film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters however its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul although i have recommended this film to several people i caution them that it can be pretty disturbing i thought about it for weeks after i saw it the first time and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again definitely not a light hearted '' evening of entertainment ||| 1
i own many of the 50 packs of movies and i must say i like this set very of these movies are from the 30 's and 40 's the hayday of movie mysterys the transfers are ok but not great and some of the movie have sterotype 's of all kinds just keep in mind when they were made and if they bother you do n't watch a nice set and a great way to build your movie collectio ||| 1
introduction 3 games to glory iii is a video compilation of the 2004 new england patriots playoffs including their super bowl victory over the philadelphia eagles in super bowl xxxix this super bowl victory was the patriots third in four years marking them as the team of for new england patriots fans it 's a chance to relive the glory of super bowl victories and three championships in four years england patriots fans probably would not particularly enjoy this video main features 3 games to glory iii provides extensive highlights of both new england patriots ' playoff wins and super bowl victory after the 2004 season these playoffs found new england once again schooling the indianapolis colts in yet another year where peyton manning and the vaunted colts offensive choke under playoff pressure the high flying colts offense was throttled by the superior schemes and tough play of the patriots in a afc divisional playoff win at gillette stadium in foxborough massachusetts this is followed by new england 's dramatic defeat of the pittsburgh steelers in the afc championship game at heinz field in pittsburgh the patriots entered this game as decided underdogs to the steelers after being throttled by pittsburgh earlier in the season finally you get to enjoy the extensive highlights of new england 's impressive win over the nfc champion philadelphia eagles this is yet another game where new england 's superior execution and stamina in the later stages of the game brought them ultimate glory the super bowl was played in jacksonville florida on february 6 2005. the highlights of each game are very extensive and seem to cover nearly every play they are also mostly well done but frankly the highlights often fail to capture the real drama of the game of course no highlight reel can match the excitement and drama of a live contest but there are times when key turning points of the game really just become another quick hit in the video there are a few disappointments in this video though and it 's not quite as well done as the preceding 3 games to glory ii covering the patriots playoff run and super bowl victory after the 2003 season first there is not as much drama and preparation presented in these videos compared to last year secondly there are not as many close up on the field shots that bring the game right into your living room it 's much more distant and not as close up as previous editions in this series despite these drawbacks it 's still great to relive a great season through these videos bonus features the bonus features on this edition of 3 games to glory are not nearly as good as the ones on 3 games to glory ii the bonus features are nice they just did n't live up the standard in the previous edition following is a brief rundown of what you 'll get on the dvd there are some bill belichick '' breakdowns of key plays for each game but there are very few of them and really leaves the viewer wanting more there 's also a points after sounds of the game '' which shows bowl press conference features but again it 's really short and leaves you wanting more the patriot 's all access '' which appears along with each of the playoff and super bowl wins shows locker room scenes and practices team meetings and other shots of players as they prepare for games these are pretty well done short features that add a great deal to the video the all access '' section for the super bowl of course included plane trip post game party and the parade i find these a bit boring frankly but i guess it 's nice to see the players up close on their daily routines the super bowl highlights are shown twice once with the regular commentary and once with commentary from rosevelt colvin lb ted johnson lb and matt light t matt light is a funny guy and this was more entertaining than the one last year i thought the best bonus feature was one on disc two called views from the past '' with interviews with three great players from previous decades gino cappelletti of the 1960 's michael haynes of the 1970 's and andre tippett of the 1980 's and 1990 's this conversation was mostly about comparing this current patriots ' team with teams of the past and how the game has changed over the decades finally the video has the 2005 playoff roster super bowl stats and 2005 game by game results just like you can get in any book it just shows it printed on the screen overall while all these bonus features are nice 3 games to glory iii is not nearly as good as 3 games to glory ii it did not include an extensive behind the scenes segment on the super bowl which i found fascinating on the previous edition nor did it have highlights for each game of the regular season like the previous edition i found the lack of these too items very disappointing as i thought they were outstanding editions to last year 's disc nevertheless the bonus features overall are nice just nice as nice as last time bottom line all new england fans should enjoy reliving a third super bowl win through this highlights package it 's mostly well done and certainly brings back great memories of a great season those who are not patriots fans i am sure would find the video quite boring disclaimer i am a die hard new england patriots fan and am totally biased in this review ||| 1
least its in my top 5 'm not the biggest chaplin of a keaton and dang if this movie dose n't do me in never fail to fall into hysterics over the feeding chair '' the gibberish several other i always get teary eyed over the plight of charlie and his little love movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next ! do n't be botherd by the hype about this being a social a commie film or whatever ! still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order ! ! i have this wonderful new 2 disc version from the chaplin collection box to pull out every christmas holiday with city i 'm want to check out the little cuban documentary on the second disc about the traveling projectionists who take the movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first tears in these peoples eyes as they you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film ||| 1
it have a plenty range of glould 's legacy personally i hate the contemporary music honestly i bought it because it have one interpretation of the magestic partita in e minor it have a rear romatic influence and definitly it do n't have the same perfection with the greatest baroque influence that glenn leave us in the one recorded in 1957. nonetheless you will see the great personality of glenn and its lively interpretation ||| 1
if you can get through david 's boot camp video with moderate effort this video may be a bit too easy for you that said this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser david does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form he is very encouraging throughout the workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used two dumbbells needed there are a few innovative moves thrown in as well since the difficulty level of any workout video is relative i 'll give a quick background of myself i run times a week for a total of i also lift weights times a week incorporating plyometrics and compound movements i 've personally found david 's boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using dumbbells and think this video is great for days i have less energy regardless of fitness level you are sure to enjoy this workout if you need to make it more intense use heavier weights the biggest thing to remember about david 's style in my opinion is to really on every repetition on the muscle being worked and on isometrics contracting the muscle without movement eg pushing against a brick wall is isometric hope this helps ||| 1
i was reading some reviews of the quiet man '' earlier this year and a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children grandchildren and i imagine great grandchildren in that league of the timeless you have to put a story of love redemtion compassion revenge retribution foregiveness and tranquility in an epic truly larger than life if we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago then certainly william wyler 's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view for me seeing it again and again i am always startled by heston 's skills as an actor often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence here the antagonist is stephen boyd judah 's best friend from childhood now addicted to the narcotic of power the two will clash this is the time of christ 's ministry christ is seen as a rabble rouser and rome an international giant the world had never seen seeks to thwart that message by girding up jerusalem so they send the now goal oriented and vicious messala to the home of heston is also supported ably by jack hawkins a brilliant actor in his prime as the roman counsel quintus arrius judah sentenced to virtual death on the roman galleys survives a battle with the macedonians to only save quintus arius i say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene the arrival of quintus arrius in rome a hero with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman judah william wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as jack hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before ceasar there must be 100 steps ! and the camera back away to see hawkins in his magenta robe draped over the pure white stairs climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire in spartacus '' also a fine movie a few years later the script tells you about the size of the roman empire here in this one scene wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word at the same time judah remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs looks around and in that one expression on heston 's face of awe and the size and the power of century rome he amplifies the scene of hawkins climbing the staircase a great great move well worth your time if you have never seen it well worth your time again if you have 5 stars larry scantlebur ||| 1
this is an outstanding dvd i highly recommend it if you have seen riverdance live you can relive the great moments if you have n't seen riverdance live you are in for a real treat with this dvd from the comfort of your own home ||| 1

for all true dream theater fans this is a must have dvd ! the only drawback to score '' that i found was that they did n't play never enough '' but that should n't prevent you from purchasing score '' i have watched the dvd over 10 times already and it has n't gotten old for ||| 1
for those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired all i can say is that you wo n't be disappointed this series is one of my all time favorite tv shows when i discovered it was on dvd i snapped it up right away the picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version i originally saw this is the first tv series i have ordered on dvd and i was afraid the picture quality would be vhs boy was i wrong this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd i have ever purchased if you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series ||| 1
my kids just love this movie barbie in the 12 dancing princesses it is a very clean movie it is not scary except for the mean duchess but she really is n't scary just mean it teaches about honesty and family and how they care about each other which is really good for children to see plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch ||| 1
before we first rented one of the barbie videos for my daughter i was expecting them to be trite and however i have been pleasantly surprised yes they do have a lot of commercial and a high saccarine count but the quality of the barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented including 12 dancing princesses '' was significantly higher than i had expected they have not just kept my children engrossed for hours including my son as well as my daughter but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music on more than one occasion i have been listening to a cd of a classic such as beethoven 's pastoral symphony or the queen of the night 's aria from mozart 's magic flute and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music and correctly remembered which barbie film had used it magic of pegasus '' and mermaidia '' respectively the soundtrack to twelve dancing princesses '' is mostly adapted from some of mendelsohn 's best work including a midsummer night 's dream '' and the scottish and italian symphonies it also includes a lullaby sung to the king by the 12 princesses which was based on a century anthem by byrd the recording of which was sung beautifully by melissa lyons and the women 's occidental glee club the story is loosely based on the children 's story barbie '' plays princess genevieve '' the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed king seven young women plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6 like the original the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night however in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the king their father who loves them very much but his cousin duchess rowena who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor at first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was as with many of the barbie films comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters in this case princess genevieve has a pet cat and the evil duchess rowena has an equally evil pet monkey brutus the hero who in this version is the royal cobbler derek has a pet parrot who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated indian accent that 's indian from the subcontinent not native american those people who enjoy criticising what the barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at if you or more importantly your kids are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness then this film and the barbie videos generally may not be for them and the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility i 'm not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is that is a concern with this film but on the plus side it is beautifully made it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour 's rest after doing so alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you wo n't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring and best of all the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it 's own ||| 1

a french art film that i rented while on vacation despite rave reviews all over the packaging this story of two moody teenage girls growing apart as sexuality enters their lives seemed pretty slow and predictable even a bit tedious jet lag set in and we gave up of the way through the film and took it back the next day in all fairness this is probably a fine film if you 're in the mood for serious art but i found it a bit dreary ||| 1
this is a really scary movie i 've always put on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever but this movie surpasses that movie i did n't expect much seeing the title of the movie which does n't sound scary at all but was i wrong dead wrong if you are a horror fan you got to see this movie the terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck asian horror movies do n't rely on gore but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops contemporary american horror movies do n't scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks asian horror movies like this one which is korean is not an original idea but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better other asian titles i recommend are dark water and the red shoes ||| 1
a fun musical comedy the trouble with girls is n't the usual elvis presley film but it 's completely charming with it 's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast presley plays walter hale manager of the traveling chautauqua '' circa 1927 who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show hale finds himself falling in love with charlene marlyn mason organiser of the children 's activities whilst trying to help local single mother nita bix sheree north when she murders her nasty married boyfriend dabney coleman presley 's numbers include swing down sweet chariot '' and clean up your own backyard '' it 's certainly a lot better than some of the other elvis films from the same period and seeing elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat marlyn mason probably one of presley 's most formidable is stunning and her rendition of sign of the zodiac '' is a knockout nicole jaffe as the amorous hotel clerk vincent price eccentric speaker mr morality '' john carradine as a colourful shakespearian actor joyce van patten disgruntled former channel swimmer maude and edward andrews as hale 's beleaguered assistant are also fine fans of classic tv shows should keep an eye out for anissa jones family affair '' and susan olsen the brady bunch '' ||| 1

fargo '' is a very good film the cohen brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film the film stars jerry lundegaard william macy as a car salesman in dire need of money when he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom things go from bad to worse i could n't help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers the father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom and decides to act on his own jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess moreover he has a saavy police chief mcdormand on the case the film is a definite as many of the cohen brother 's films are this one is a bit more disturbing than usual however hot on the case is a policewoman marge gunderson frances mcdormand she is witty and intelligent and knows something is not right steve buscemi stars as one of the kidnappers and his partner has a few loose marbles the film is a delightful at times funny film that is highly recommended moreover there are many colorful and funny character actors in the film which only enhance the films appeal there are also some disturbing scenes however the film is well worth the watch and purchase highly recommended stars 4.5 ||| 1
i thought the film was great it has a interesting storyline it also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on i do n't understand why people will rate this movie so low is it cuz it does n't have a established in it that it is n't some mainstream unoriginal film which even the most moronic of morons can grasp listen do n't rate this movie low if it does n't seem good to you because it requires thinking unlike the mainstream films in the theaters you stay to your pablum mainstream films and leave those people who work hard on indie films alone for the people who complained the girls were dressed too little i 've seen many more hollywood films where women wear nothing but string bikinis basically these girls were dressed for a majority of the film for the person who said ashley was plump '' you must really like your women to be anorexic ||| 1
i did this workout for the very first time today and i do n't think i 've felt ever felt this good about myself this dvd works it 's not high impact aerobics but i do n't think i 've ever sweat that much in one workout before and i totally disagree with whoever said the breaks every twenty minutes makes you sleepy i 'm not in very good shape so i need those breaks to be able to do the entire workout i did n't think i 'd like this dvd because it is one of the longer ones ana and ravi put out i am really really looking forward to getting the other two fat free dvds to add to my collection ||| 1
i think this is a great film many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it 's running time 128 minutes insisting it 's too slow almost all of clint 's films the ones he 's directed run long the running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours the longest being bird at 2 hours 40 minutes sure the film is n't pc but it was made in 1975 when you did n't have to be pc but there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film these are nervewracking and incredibly authentic clint did all his own stunts in these sequences and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences and they are very intense to watch because you know the actors are really up there no cgi in those days this is one of the reasons they work so well cgi looks fake anyway it makes movies seem like cartoons people know it is n't real cgi reliance should be reduced in hollywood as it takes the tension out of action scenes check this film out it 's worth all of its 128 minutes ||| 1
recently realizing that jackie chan and jet li are about done with movie making for the most part i always wondered if there was anyone who could take over chan and li are one of a kind and the best out there fortunately tony jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own the first thing i like about tony jaa is he is an expert in muay thai fighting something new and original for the good guy in a movie the next thing i like is that he fights like jet li and does stunts like jackie chan though once again he adds his own originality quite often ong bak is pure action excitement do n't expect a deep story and do expect horrible english dubbing that is just down right annoying you can still switch to subtitles with thai spoken if desired if these 2 things do n't matter to you this movie just plains rocks its a bit slow here and there but overall it is filled with all the action you could want illegal club fights an incredible club brawl fight tons of stunts and chases a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars a ring fight and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts lasting for a good 10 minutes i also liked the background music for the movie lots of smooth hip hop beats i 'm pleased to say that with newcomer tony jaa to the world of martial arts films the loss of chan and li someday soon wo n't be as bad ong bak is brilliant action and originality the only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing which chan and li movies do much better ||| 1
a friend of mine told me about this movie and i went to the local video store and rented it crazy ! ! ! i thought that the cgi and wire work was so smooth that it almost looked real however after watching the special features of him doing the stunts from the movie live ! ! jackie who bruce what jet whatchamacallit he is the martial arts star for the new generation for those that see the decline of martial arts movies this kid gives us hope ||| 1
a hilarious movie made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you 'd find in the object of it 's spoofing top gun '' the film is loaded with abrahams 's usual puns slapstick and quick wordplay there 's always something going on in the background making for fun repeat viewings the overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience besides that it 's educational too ! you 'll never again wonder what a chafing dish is ||| 1
the product is but why arewe penalised for late delivery in the form of warfage ! ! ! ! ! shurly this is wrong ||| 1
this dvd was better than i could have asked for it uses footage from the tv show this week in baseball twib and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of america 's pastime it goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including tim hudson ryan dempster select phillies players many others as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as tommy lasorda and yogi berra if you love twib 's how 'bout that '' section of the show you will adore this dvd as far as i can tell every major league team is shown though some have the spotlight on them more than others this is a must have for any baseball fan it 's by far one of the best mlb dvds released in a long time ||| 1
this is a sad little gem of a movie i really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love the story had as much to do with issues of identity community and fidelity in my opinion there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved especially when considering the quality of the performances the slight quiver in weisz 's voice was right on target as was perez 's accent the rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable considering the type of story and the setting i ca n't help but think that a would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film i emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character ||| 1
i have watched the first disk of the tick and i laughed my ass off ! ! i am working on getting a copy of it in order to send it to comedy central and requst that they air the first season on their channel i think that fox screwed up by cancelling this show and that comedy central should pick it up it is by far the best show i have seen in awhile and deserves to be resurrected ! ! thank you ||| 1
i 'm the kind of guy who takes out large clumps of grass with every swing no matter what club i use it 's so bad that my so called '' friends would n't even go to the range with me anymore because i embarrassed them too much i was the butt of all the jokes at the office too i already had a closet full of vhs tapes and a few dvds i 've spend hundreds on my local golf pro '' and i 've been reading magazines for years but i just never could figure out the what where and whys of my game a friend recommended this set so i got one and it 's been great i could easily understand and follow alone with the tips so well that i must have watched all the tips in one weekend and after only a few rounds i could finally start to understand what 's going on with each drive approach and putt i hit and that 's helped me improve enough that my friends are playing with me again in my opinion anyone would find these dvds helpful even my local golf pro '' would benefit from this collection however i 'm not sure i 'll give away my new edge to all my friends '' at least until i can cut a few more strokes and they have to play catch up ||| 1
martin short joins the cast in this volume securing this show 's enduring genius and originality the cast brilliant as always never fail to deliver i grew up watching this show and what a thrill to have it on dvd i feel like they have finally come home ! ! ! woo hoo ! ! ||| 1

visually aurally this is a feast ! great musicianship excellent lighting colour camera angles etc etc if you know like pat know the piece you wo n't be really disappointed but the reason it 's not for me is a combination of 2 things relatively insignificant in themselves but together worth knocking off a star first there 's no intro the first note is struck with the title screen still showing no pictures of the band standing taking the crowd 's ovation the credits start rolling straight after the last note i always find it nice to get a sense of the atmosphere location occasion before and after the music starts playing second those familiar with the piece will be aware of the extraordinary interplay closing out part two well i 'm not sure if this is in the playing or sound on the night or the dvd mixing but as the sound builds the trumpet dynamic gets a bit lost all you really hear as an individual voice is the guitar synth great of course but could 've been even better ! this said for a pat product still means a must buy '' ! ||| 1
'the bunker ' is one of three films that deal with hitler 's final days as the soviets encircle berlin and put an end to the third reich in 1945 'the bunker ' is both one of the best and one of the worst of the three the others being 1973 's 'hitler the last ten days ' and 2005 's 'downfall ' at the same time the triumph of 'the bunker ' is anthony hopkins tour de force performance as hitler at times so exact it is as if you are watching a newsreel the element that makes the film almost painful to watch is that almost a of it is dedicated to the whitewashing of convicted nazi war criminal albert speer one thing that makes 'the bunker ' different from the others is the occasional use of flashbacks and although brief they do allow hopkins to portray hitler in different venues and in a relaxed mode casually chating and enjoying the company of friends when times were fat in the bunker itself hopkins turns hitler purple in a full throttle rage as he yells about the need to destroy the scourge and pestilence of jewish marxism ! '' 'hitler the last ten days ' does a bit better than the rest in portraying the supporting cast of characters in the drama but one stands out in 'the bunker ' and that is michael lonsdale as martin borman hitler 's personal secretary and gatekeeper a man of considerable power who plays his cards close to the vest and is always scheming to stay one step ahead of his rivals despite its flaws 'the bunker ' earns a high rating as the hopkins performance simply can not be missed ||| 1
this is a fantastic video i use it regularly for teaching it gives a wonderful sophisticated view of chuck close as an individual and an artist as well as a glimpse of the other artist 's work who are interviewed in the video it is filmed in a very immediate and personal style there is nothing stiff boring or disconnected about it common faults of many art videos anyone who has experienced a similar tragedy in their family will find the discussion of chuck 's event '' very moving and not at all sappy ||| 1
bergman first introduced us to johan and marianne in his 1974 masterpiece scenes from a marriage one of the cinema 's most exacting dissections of our failure to connect bergman and the splendid scandanavian actors erland josephson and liv ullmann took us through johan and marianne 's marriage divorce and reconciliation in the end they live apart but still make room for the bond between them three decades later bergman josephson and ullmann have given us saraband a gift marianne decides that even though she has n't seen johan since the it 's time to make contact again johan has inherited money from an aunt and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake she literally wakes him with a kiss but soon enough marianne 's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in johan 's family henrik johan 's son is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter karin both of them still mourn anna henrik 's wife and karin 's mother who died two years before henrik a music teacher is preparing karin an accomplished cellist for her conservatory entrance exams the elderly johan remains but charismatic not unlike bergman 's own father and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him henrik wants his father 's affection and acceptance even though johan refuses to give it ostensibly due to some slight by henrik when he was 19 years old in a painful scene henrik goes to johan to ask for money to help karin and in his 61 year old face we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his father for karin her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father karin struggles to figure out what she owes henrik what she owes to the memory of her mother and what she owes to herself she lets marianne see some but not all of the turmoil she 's going through for marianne her attraction to johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him she 's always wanted something from him but since she ca n't define what it is she 'll probably never get it the struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by marianne 's opening and closing monologues karin makes her choices henrik reacts marianne throws herself once more against johan 's emotional aloofness as he 's done throughout his brilliant career bergman brings it alive through artful dialog perfect dramatic timing and riveting cinematic composition the characters are not always likable but they are never less than engrossing the criterion 's dvd includes a of bergman making saraband we watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking kid around with the crew poke and prod his actors into position it 's a treat to watch him work one wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from julia dufvenius the fine young actress who plays karin one also wonders why bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he 'd announced he was through bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection apparently he wants to say one last thing about it which seems to be this after all the tears and shouting all the posturing and cruelty all the reaching out and pulling back this is what remains marriages of true minds the photo of anna used in the film is a picture of bergman 's great love his deceased wife ingrid the fraught ties of fathers and sons memories of old loves what you give and get from children and the devolution of the flesh none of it is easy the master tells us but all of it is necessary in the end it 's all you have what 's truly sad is that bergman sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey claims that he 's done he did for film what shakespeare did for theater took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving he will certainly be missed and he ca n't be replaced but do n't see saraband for nostalgic reasons it 's a moving insightful film that deserves a place in the director 's canon saraband stands on its own but it 's a deeper experience if you watch scenes from a marriage first ||| 1
the enduring legacy around truffaut 's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from novel and in showing that elusive rapport oskar werner henri serre and especially jeanne moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the french new wave fortunately the criterion collection dvd set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times the story focuses on the friendship between two writers an austrian named jules and a frenchman named jim kindred spirits who enjoy a decadent lifestyle in paris inspired by a statue of a woman 's face with a most enigmatic smile they agree that they are destined to fall in love with a woman with the same smile enter catherine as seductively capricious a as ever there was in cinema and the two men are instantly enamored jules is intent on marrying her even though it 's clear from the outset that she is not one who could commit for the long term the war intercedes and the two friends are fighting on opposite sides after the war catherine married to jules and raising their young daughter is emotionally dissatisfied and embarks on an affair with jim with jules ' blessing things are idyllic for a while but jim proves too much the alpha male to defer to catherine 's whims and the resulting imbalance leads to increasingly dramatic consequences in just his third film truffaut 's trademark style emerges with fast cuts between scenes and naturalistic camera movements courtesy of raoul coutard 's fluid cinematography moreover george delerue 's animated music score and michel subor 's voiceover add to the evocative memory atmosphere at times the storyline feels a bit disjointed but the fulsome performances more than compensate werner fully captures the internal struggle within jules in attempting to reconcile his love for catherine with her impossible demands on him serre has the comparatively more objective role but convincingly shows his character surrendering to the tangled situation after her impressive turn as an obsessed adulterer in louie malle 's elevator to the gallows '' moreau solidifies her vaunted reputation here conveying catherine 's petulance and unyielding passion in a vividly mercurial fashion the dvd extras are abundant starting with two commentary tracks the first one a more factual account of the production was recorded in 1992 with truffaut collaborator suzanne schiffman editor claudine bouche jean gruault and scholar annette insdorf the second produced in 2000 is far better as it has moreau sharing her personal recollections of the filming with truffaut biographer serge toubiana disc one also includes a brief 1966 interview with truffaut discussing and a 1985 featurette the key to jules and jim '' which contains interviews with the author 's friends as they discuss the inspirations for the characters disc two takes a broader look at truffaut with five separate interviews with the director over the span of fifteen years as well as insightful interviews with coutard and jean gruault ||| 1
i 'll tell ya if i read one more review written by someone born after 1980 dissing bakshi i think i 'm going to start kicking rump and taking names do people diss disney hardly until they became such a movie mill that they are computer generating what used to be created by hand with a loving touch look at cool world '' as the antitoonworld of roger rabbit '' the characters are psychedelic psychotic retro and bent there is a great deal of expected sexuality and lewdness pushing the edge of the as far as it can go lots of puns and inside jokes it takes an adult to appreciate something warner cartoons were masters at granted they do n't always hit the mark here and there 's more chemistry when the doodles are on than when the noids take over but i dare anyone to watch that scene with holli cooing let 's make love '' to a sweating mel torme wannabe while she 's having trouble keeping her noidness intact and not feel the simulataneous urge to salivate and giggle the transformation of noids to doodles when the wand is removed is humorous a lounge lizard literally becomes one a cowboy becomes a horse a female lead a blank eyed orphan annie the end cap where byrne 's character becomes a dim witted but sincere superhero is happily reminiscent of captain sternn from heavy metal '' yes the acting is practically phoned in yes the plot is odd but get over it folks it 's adult animation and it 's entertaining i watch it again and again and i always laugh ||| 1
trapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept they did it in saw ii house on haunted hill and then there were none and i 'm sure quite a few others but that plot seems to always work it does for me house of 9 is no exception it does n't follow a storyline that 's predictable even though the plot is not unknown there are surprises suspense thrills and tense moments believe me you wo n't predict the ending i was very satisfied with the movement of this film it 's an interesting watch ||| 1
samuel jackson and kevin spacey turn two distinct yet strong performances jackson is always great to watch for his intensity and this role suits that to a tee spacey continues to impress with a solid and believable performance this film and its cast are dated by today 's standards but the two main actors and the good story more than make up for it highly worthwile ||| 1
2 is better than the original i feel i should get that out of the way first since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one however i feel 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade it should naturally be better that 's what this sequel feels like a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there it 's a good film but it 's not really the way i thought a sequel should be effects are even better than the first and the tentacles of doc ock make for some truly spectacular battles including a centerpiece on a runaway train tobey maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of peter parker and has good chemistry with kirsten dunst as mary jane alfred molina has more to work with as doc ock than dafoe did as the goblin and humanizes what was once a wacky villain james franco continues to develop harry osborn well and the supporting cast like jk simmons and rosemary harris fill out the acting but the script needs work it uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot that of the hero calling it quits it 's never convincing and the film drags as we wait for peter to realize things we 've known all along character relationships though do n't seem to have progressed since the first movie we 're still treading the jane love triangle just with a different third wheel harry still has his friendship with peter there are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one for a story supposedly set 3 years later it might as well have been 3 days we get a dvd with good extras and presentation i enjoy 2 on its own and it 's nice to have it in my dvd library but as a sequel it 's not fresh enough for me hopefully next year 's 3 will fix that ||| 1

the tale starts out with a historical reference to chaucer for a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected and then you see the michael powell and emeric pressburger eagle that transitions us form times to present day 1944 england time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog we find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to canterbury army sergt bob johnson sergeant john sweet on his way to canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of kent he is accused of having his stripes on upside down british sgt peter gibbs dennis price is temporarily stationed at kent while staging for overseas he was and theater organ player before the war alison smith sheila sim a london store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a girl ' she seems to have an uncanny knowledge of kent and the pilgrims ' road to canterbury the night they got off the train at kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious glue man '' then befriended by the local magistrate thomas colpeper jp thomas colpeper jp colpeper is interested in the history of the pilgrims ' road from kent to canterbury until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you is the focus on a local mystery the interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves be sure to get the criterion version with the second dvd the main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian ian christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star ||| 1
this documentary is very concise and very straight forward it does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir it features interviews with some very credible sources all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic i really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together this documentary makes a great point and i 'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics ||| 1
one of the best movies i have seen ! ! ! the subject itself forces you to look at your own limitations on anything that is out of your 'normal ' boundaries after watching this movie you have a better insight on how limited most of us are and how this causes a lot more harm than we think it does in terms of film quality it is also one of the best i have seen the actors are tremendous the characters are so accurately portrayed that you actually feel the pain of each one of them of course ludovic 's innocence is rendered beautifully but the changes that the mother goes through are very emotionally charged maybe because i am a mother myself she seems at first to be the most understanding of all when it comes to her son 's differences then goes through a confusion stage and then tries really hard to understand him but when her family 's whole life setting house husband 's job social life goes havoc she closes down emotionally on her own son which is extremely painful to watch after one final emotionally violent confrontation with ludovic she realizes that she 's loosing him and finally sees him the way it should be her beautiful child nothing more nothing less it is also filmed in a very colorful manner especially during ludovic 's escapes into dreamland which accentuate the notion of ludovic 's innocence the neighborhood setting seems to be a bit of a caricature of american suburbia green front lawns barbecue parties with an european flavor adults dancing at neighborhood parties in any case the movie seems to make a clear statement that intolerance seems to be most prominent in white surburban populations which many could find this to be a bit of a stereotype in any case i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants something more out of movie than what is presented in mainstream movies ||| 1
monty python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever they made a tv show monty python 's flying circus and several hilarious movies and now for something completely different their first movie which is a collection of their best skits from their tv show this movie is hilarious it includes the lumberjack song the dead parrot sketch the dirty fork and the world funniest joke monty python and the holy grail their best movie it 's about arthur and his knights looking for the holy grail this movie will make you laugh insanely funny moments include the killer rabbit the knights who say ni and the black knight the adventures of baron munchausen this movie is not a monty python film but was made by terry gilliam and eric idle both of whom are former pythons a must have for any monty python fan this set deserves the five stars and more i recommend this to any monty python fan british comedy fan or comedy fan in general too bad it did n't inlude the meaning of life or life of brian ||| 1

i spent ten years working various scenes at the trinity church hellhouse yes it is a bit campy and yes it is often over the top but i can say that the people are well intentioned just a bit off target i attended trinity church from birth until i was 22 years old i do not attend their anymore because of the attitude that is prevalant in this documentary i stopped doing hellhouse when they added the decision room my last year i just felt it was an scare tactic i now feel that way about the entire operation the worst feeling i get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves i know because i was once one of them i have found that a growing number of former trinity youth group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons i listed above this movie will open your eyes to the way teens are herded like cattle in fundamentalist christian churches ||| 1
this is a movie you 'll want to watch over again a number of times for a number of reasons for one you 'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first perhaps the second and third too and even beyond as the legend goes with the exception of a few brief breathers director howard hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film 's sleek 92 minutes with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once i agree with the amazon review you 'll also want to give the movie at least one look devoted exclusively to cary grant 's performance as news chief walter burns one can only marvel at his incendiary reactions to each situational development the big scoop involves the gallows sentence of a meek little anarchist '' john qualen alleged to have killed a black cop and while ferociously tracking the story burns chats up and tries to reclaim his ace reporter hildy johnson the movie is based on hecht and macarthur 's broadway hit the front page an early version had been produced already for the silver screen but hawks decided his inspired idea of switching hildy 's gender to that of a woman justified another remake he was right of the various stage and film renditions his girl friday is regarded as the most powerful and effective use of the source material handed this basic premise scriptwriter charles lederer added one last layer of complexity hildy johnson is not just any woman but walter burns 's as the action begins she is bidding the chaotic cynical reporter 's life farewell having decided to settle down and marry an insurance man named bruce baldwin ralph bellamy perfect as the earnest foil to grant on hearing this burns hatches his plot if he can pull off the entire stunt he will beat the competition to a story on local corruption by getting hildy involved again and helping her realize the hawksian principle that you are what you do '' he will also regain a writer of rare talent these two goals alone would be enough to keep his motivation interesting but of course the chance to win back his brings a sexy tension to the frantic lunatic action the one thing you have to do is reserve a viewing strictly for watching rosalind russell as hildy in the part that literally no one wanted jean arthur claudette colbert irene dunne and carole lombard all turned it down russell succeeds in making his girl friday her movie among her colleagues in the press room played by a sterling ensemble of character actors she 's got the wit to sound right at home with the boys at the same time she stands out not just in her bold pinstriped outfits but with her unflagging dedication to the raw grind of the professional news man '' when necessary she dashes from telephone to telephone one raging conversation to the next yet in the movie 's moment of high pathos she manages to be absoltuely riveting while barely raising her voice above a whisper finally of course her kinetic scenes with grant are what earn this movie its reputation as one of the fastest funniest zingers ever produced my sole warning fork over the dough for columbia 's authorized release the 's and there are several on the market are pretty shabby in terms of image and sound quality with so much in your future do what it takes to get the best version ||| 1
i do n't usually like romance films but 2046 is brilliant ! a mind trip and sensual candy ! if you have a short attention span you will not appreciate this work of art but if the first half draws you in the second half will blow your mind ! wong kar wai sets up analogies between the relationships of each character by comparing characters in this way we are given infinite perspectives on the characters and their emotions this is genius ! this is art ! full of colorful symbolism ||| 1
i have ever to say for this acting great story and great n't hesitate go get will be one of the gems in your movie collection and please guys when you come to movies like this masterpiece do n't give them a 3 star beacuse it did n't have many extras or something like movie is that counts ||| 1

there were loads of swords sorcery films coming out in the 80 's most of them low budget garbage but this was actually one of the better films it had a lot wrong with it but it had enough good to make it enjoyable richard lynch is cromwell who plots against the throne takes power as the young prince talon lee horsley eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant pretty standard stuff but it 's exectuted well the opening is stolen directly from robert howard 's conan story the hour of the dragon '' as cromwell and his conspirators including a witch find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful ancient sorcerer in the conan story the sorcerer 's name was zaltotun in this movie the name is xusia mere coincidence i think not but xusia is played well be the towering richard moll of night court fame he 's suitably imposing and evil as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life unfortunately xusia does n't get enough screen time lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here too horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by errol flynn in robin hood than by conan he 's a reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne he is eventually captured and cromwell has him nailed to a cross although it 's an x '' cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism again this is a scene lifted from a conan story a witch shall be born '' when conan was nailed to a cross only conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while talon actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately now i 'm no doctor but i 'm guessing that someone who had a 4 '' nail driven through their palms is not going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but ok it 's fantasy so i 'll buy it still despite some shortcomings this is an enjoyable little diversion the ending credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized ||| 1
the technical quality of the dvd is excellent my interest in the movie is the result of seeing a photo on a friend 's wall of charlie chaplin and an actor the actor hugh sasson was the uncle of my friend 's mother he appears early in the movie as the person who has his pocket picked the photo is the shot in front of the hot dog stand when the victim sees the tramp paying for a hot dog out of his wallet we set the photo on the tv and stepped through this scene on the dvd one frame at a time it gave us all goose bumps as somehow the extreme slow motion made them seem alive in real time additionally the story of the production difficulties found on disk 2 are fascinating ||| 1

mighty quinn '' features a young sexy denzel washington xavier quinn as a smart detective who did a stint with the fbi and returns home as police chief on a carribbean island there 's a shadowy plot involving bills a guerilla movement and guns but the movie focuses more on quinn 's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder and quinn 's own discomfort from having made good '' but ending up caught between two worlds white and black he 's also caught between the islanders ' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation this film is full of sexy island women colorful reggae music and real world dilemmas of race and identity no matter that we could n't quite figure out if the plot hung together a winner ||| 1

if you are at all interested in synthesizers their impact on the music world and how the moog synthesizer changed history this is a 'must have ' i just wish i had bought my copy and had bob autograph it before he passed away i did go to his memorial service a little late i admit but this dvd gives so much insight into the realm of the synth there 's a fair amount of footage from the anniversary event moogfest '' at bb king 's in nyc in may of 2004. i attended that show and was just one table from the stage right in front of keith emerson and his there is also some segments of bob and rick wakeman back stage it was rick wakeman 's birthday good stuff i would buy it if i were you i am me and i did buy it and i 'm not sorry ! ||| 1
i first saw dragonslayer '' when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981. it was the first vhs movie i ever purchased it 's very well made an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about it still holds up caitlin clarke 's performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job i wrote her when the film came out telling her as much and received a thank you letter i learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004 dragonslayer '' has action humor humanity political irony and if none of those matter to you it 's just plain fun ||| 1
good movie with a unique storyline special effects were very good for the time of filming ||| 1
other people 's money is a wonderful movie full of smart dialogue good music and a terrific danny devito performance devito is his usual funny and self while gregory peck is a patriarch very good stuff there the weakest performance is from penelope ann miller who is n't really convincing as the corporate attorney but the material is so good that it saves the movie this is a 5 star film however it loses a star because of the last scene which feels a bit tacked on otherwise a smart and funny film from the director of moonstruck ||| 1
i bought a balance ball kit from another location but wanted a more complete workout than the sampler that came with the kit i like the workout a lot and i think it will be a good strengthening and toning tool i like that there is a separate relaxation workout for stress relief and i like that the workout cycles through the different body parts ||| 1
the uncut version of the anime is much better than what is aired on tv though there are still some diferences between the japanese version and what is in the uncut version i would n't recomend the special edition unless you are a hard core naruto fan the bonus items that come with it are mainly geared toward younger viewers and not much towards adult viewrs ||| 1
the great thing about the naruto series is it has an involved ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously the episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen it has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams my small gripes are that for some reason naruto has the catch phrase of believe it ! and it gets dropped into places that it does n't make any sense but it 's a small problem also the extras you get are really fun and high quality this is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike ||| 1

i wake up screaming '' was the first film noir made at century fox its greatest distinction is its visual style whose lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after world war ii cinematographer edward cronjager created a striking early example of noir '' lighting john alton appropriately called mystery lighting '' in this film made in 1941 before the united states entered the war the story is based on the novel of the same name by stephen fisher adapted for the screen by dwight taylor who moved the action to new york gave it a flashback structure and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in hollywood that combines multiple genres mystery romance musical the singing scene was cut comedy suspense and psychological drama but the suspense does dominate when model and aspiring actress vicky lynn carole landis is murdered the police are quick to blame frankie christopher victor mature a fight promoter who met vicky when she was a waitress introduced her to all the right people and managed her ascent to glamour girl she left him for hollywood vicky 's sister jill betty grable disapproved of her career choice but does n't want to believe frankie responsible for her death the assistant district attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator elisha cook at the lynns ' apartment building is the killer but sadistic police detective ed cornell laird cregar wo n't let up on frankie constantly harassing and threatening him leaving frankie little choice but to find the killer himself i wake up screaming '' opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape that got my attention then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station frankie christopher is harshly lit with one lamp surrounded by police officers in the shadows gorgeous dramatic lighting the faces of some characters even frankie are sometimes completely blacked out i do n't know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it 's deliberate but it 's daring everywhere we go in the station house there are bars and shadows the implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming the police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic this really surprised me in such an early film but it 's fabulous this was betty grable 's first role she 's all sweetness and goodness but she is also practical and brave in the mold of a film noir unfortunately every time she appears on screen we hear somewhere over the rainbow '' which eventually drove me a little nuts victor mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist but the performance comes from laird cregar as the very creepy obsessed police detective cornell he 's truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains the dialogue is n't except for a few lines delivered by vicky but i wake up screaming '' is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering hollywood 's visual vocabulary the dvd century fox 2006 a few scenes show some white specks and lines but this print is generally good sound is good bonus features a deleted scene called daddy '' 4 min in which betty grable sings this does n't fit the tone of the movie well so it was best left out hot spot '' text is a brief account of the film 's title change from i wake up screaming '' to hot spot '' and back again we can watch the opening credits for the film with the hot spot '' title 1 min there are 3 still galleries '' a poster gallery 3 posters a production stills gallery of photos 8 and a unit photography gallery of publicity stills 38 photos it 's interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself there is a theatrical trailer 2 min film noir historian eddie muller delivers a good nearly constant audio commentary he compares the screenplay to steven fisher 's novel provides background information for many of the creative crew and actors discusses the noir visual style and the juxtaposition of light and dark thematic elements in the film muller speaks a lot about the people involved in the film as always subtitles for the film are available in english and spanish ||| 1
feature alice wu 's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling unforced humor and a trio of winning performances with a conflicted protagonist at its core the film shares the same territory as ol parker 's imagine me and you '' and ian iqbal rashid 's overly cute a touch of pink '' wu however manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes the plot focuses on wil short for wilhelmina an obviously talented surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional chinese family living across the east river in flushing referred to just as ma '' in the story her mother is a widowed beautician who only speaks mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her wil 's eyes nevertheless are set squarely on a comely ballerina named vivian who happens to be the daughter of wil 's supervising surgeon at the hospital meantime ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home ma moves in with wil and the inevitable consequences ensue there are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads as wil michelle krusiec is a terrific find evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times lynn chen is saucy and inviting as vivian though i wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable culminating in the inevitable scene despite the beauty of her younger joan chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning yet she is able to convey the necessary brittle distanced manner as ma making her character 's process more rewarding the ending is on the pat side especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a riff on the graduate '' but it does n't compromise the charm of the piece special mention should go to harlan bosmajian 's cinematography which captures the saturated colors found in the community the 2005 dvd contains wu 's thoughtful commentary on a separate track as well as several deleted scenes a standard featurette and a rather dull sundance video diary ||| 1
scenes from a marriage is a swedish film by ingmar bergman to me this is one of the best films ever it not only captures a great story but it is done so well what makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel act and generally take care of issues this is n't one of those american films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them in here as he is telling his wife about this other lover she is without emotions just staring off with no real reactions whatsoever a way most would respond this is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is it is later that she finds outs that perhaps the marriage is n't so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce there the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage he later says he 's been with a woman for a while now and shortly there after leaves her after a year of so they get together to sign the divorce papers which turns out rough at the end after some time they get together again and in some way fall in love once again even though both are married to other people there the movies ends great film ! hard to watch some american films now because most just seem horrible and in ways corny i 'm glad i got to see a great film like this ||| 1

threshold starring carla gugino special guest catherine bell episode 11 outbreak i loved this show i liked it when it was on cbs and i like it even more now that i got the dvd 's with the unaired shows to at least try to bring it to some sense of a conclusion carla gugino was very good as usual playing a strong woman named molley anne caffrey a contingency analayst who 's job it is to come up with worst case scenarios for any natural or disaters earthquake hurricanes wwiii epidemics worldwide finacial depression you get the picture the one she is called upon for is for a scenario named threshold '' hence the name of the show threshold is the contengency plan for alien invasion her job is now to put the plan in motion to quickly assemble a team made up of a physian a an areonautics engineer and navy seal whose job it is to implement the orders she gives out usually via military force or other covert means and to protect the red team '' and asscess the threat and plan how to stop the threat the actors who played the other members on molly 's team were all good and i believed and cared for them all but this review is about carla and catherine so i will get to the point carla owned the show she carried it off just like she did in karen sisco '' she told a great story and added importance to a very well done show i really do believe she is one of the best and underrated actresses in the business today and she was just stunningly beautiful every time she was on camera you could not help but to focus on her the camera loved her the beauty made you look her way but the acting the way she carried herself made you stay focused on her catherine bell was on the episode outbreak '' this episode was about about how molly and her team discovered that one of the ways the aliens could spread and infect people was through the food supply now they already knew this a few episodes before but they thought they took care of it but they were wrong molley needed to know exactly how they spread it to what foods and how long did it take effect on people who ate it so she basically drafted catherine bell and made her apart of the team whether she wanted to or not catherine bell played daphene larsons an expert on botony and biology who figured out that some foods were more likely to get it and that it was mainly tomatos and food like it that they need to worry about i 'm afraid catherine did not get much to work with here and she was only on it for that epsiode and only mentioned it the rest i was told that had the show been picked up and went the next year she would have been a full blown cast member but catherine like carla was stunningly beautiful however she does not have the same presence as carla does when she on camera she did a good job but she had next to nothing to work with and there was no essence within her or her character 's personality that took over when you got over her looks as opposed to carla when she was on carla was on her game and stayed on it it was her show catherine did the best she could with what little she had she was not on her game but it was n't her show carla and catherine had really no interaction together the only one they kinda had was when molly was briefing daphene on threshold and the story thus far and that was done with daphine sitting in a chair looking confused and while molly stood in front of her and explained it all and it was all done using cross fade and fade edits i appreciated the effects nice touch but i would have liked to see some real dialogue there i 'm pretty sure had there been an episode 14 they would have done something together like i do n't know kick some alien butt together or kissed in conclusion i loved the show then tension kept me going and seemed real it was n't neardy and though it was scfi i really did'nt get that feeling there was more to the story it was intellegently done and i wanted more but they cancelled it the last epsiode did however give it some closeuer so you do n't feel too cheated buying one season of the show it left you having enough questions as to where you wanted to see more but could still come up with your own conclusions they ended it like they could add more to the story at a later date in a form of a movie or another show but if they never do then i guess it is still okay the show was supposed to last three years going in accordance to molly 's scernario 1. threshold we have spotted and accessed the threat 2. foothold they have established themselves on earth we have notified the public and began to stop them by any means necessary probably what season 2 would have been called 3. stranglehold if it get to this point it either means we have stopped them and sent them home or they have won and anhilated us season three title i suppose she never came up with a stage i guess it would be pointless ||| 1
cbs 's threshold held the promise of a good thriller however regardless of it 's interesting story premise good acting and well supported production team it like nbc 's surface '' and abc 's invasion '' was cancelled although i considered it the weakest of the three mentioned it alone was told before production ended it was not being hence it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why i rated it 4 vice 3 stars was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb possibly but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube 's reality '' shows and less than funny comedies was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting maybe but carla gugino molly charles dutton blaylock brent spiner fenway rob benedict lucas peter dinklage ramsey and brian holt cavennaugh did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters sadly they did n't have the opportunity to finish the job was it cancelled because it did n't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes arguably but the team did offer some great visuals interesting plotlines and nightmare scenarios so why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer does n't appreciate a good story takes time to develop the alias 24 law order csi smallville numbers is it worth buying or renting yes though a cancelled series it has that one thing most of it 's one season wonders do n't have an adequate conclusion that does n't leave you wondering how a is to be resolved ||| 1
do n't be fooled by stupid commercials that make this movie look inappropriate or like soap operas this movie is awsome and not at all about the guys chasing the girls inappropriate behavior or anything it 's definitely worth seeing and watching again great movie ||| 1

i 've been encouraged by pat metheny 's music since 1980 that 's a long time to follow one guy 's music track but through it all he has always grown and done more than you would expect his trio record set the standard in the early days with bright size life jaco and bob moses and his pmg work has been unusual and different and refreshing one reviewer mentions cheesy tunes '' in what sense in the sense that they do n't conform to a rigid set of jazz sounds that we 've come to expect bass x y and great jazz musicians are innovators and what pmg has done consistently through its life and continues to do is to create it 's own genre of music unto itself completely unique are you going to find 14 other groups sounding like this no way not even one i know cheesy music when i hear it and there are plenty of mainstream jazz artists that are guilty of it in addition to the usual suspects most jazz musicians will be remembered as that guy or gal that sounded kind of like miles or kind of like coltrane or brecker or whatever the great ones are the ones others are compared to and pat metheny falls in that category if you are to creative music and want to enjoy great musicians at the top of their game creating art together as a team listening well and bringing fresh new ideas to life then buy or rent this dvd if you want to hear what one kid from missouri who was by age 15 determined to play with gary burton and he did was able to do with the guitar by just doggedly pursuing it year after year creating fresh new material taking the beauty of the guitar to new levels each and every year then listen to this dvd and be a part of his history because pat is one of the true geniuses of our age his relationship with lyle mays persists to this day what a story of loyalty working together though a lifetime and pat is able to draw more talent out of his musicians than most bandleaders a lot of jazz artists have used richard bona over the years as a talented fretless bass player but pat metheny gave him a stage to share the whole range of his talent he does a solo with himself and some percussion and a delay pedal that is amazing he harmonizes with himself and creates a tapestry of sound cuong vu did something similar on this dvd with his trumpet the drummer and bass player antonio sanchez and steve rodby are just on it this is a great band if you get a chance to hear their austin city limits performance i think it is slightly better in the sense of how raw it is this performance is more polished and of course a lot more time was taken in the mastering of this both live performances are worth checking out ||| 1
i first watched this incredible group of musicians i believe on austin city limits and was totally taken in by the magic these guys perform along with very very good camera work which complimented their every move pat 's fascials are captured intensly as well as all of the musicians the performance is flawless and you will find yourself feeling as if you are here '' bravo ! ! bobby gee florida ||| 1
i 've been doing pilates for several months along my daily yoga practice and it 's been an incredible and effective addition to my program ! at this point i have collected about 17 pilates programs along my 90 yoga programs and there are certain teachers that have shone above the rest for me moira stott is one of those special teachers that has a way of communicating so clearly and putting together such sound practices that i always look forward to spending time with her programs i had purchased the four dvd pack basics '' fit and firm '' secret to flat abs '' and sculpt and tone '' and just this morning did fit and firm '' for the first time for someone brand new to pilates i highly recommend the basics '' dvd it 's the single best beginners i 've worked with since starting pilates as always moira starts with detailed explanations and warm ups and with the help of a student who demonstrates beautifully leads you through a wonderful well paced pilates practice this practice basically follows the intermediate pilates series with some additional advanced poses added in as well it 's about 45 minutes long but flows so beautifully that the time really flies by some people find moria stott to be dry or boring but i find her to be a pleasure to practice with perhaps because i 'm from a yoga background daily for the past nine years i 'm used to teachers who are less rah rah '' i also do n't like blaring music when i 'm practicing yoga or pilates so moira 's approach fits me well if you like teachers who have a more hyper in your face '' personality then this may not be a good fit for you but if you want a teacher who knows her stuff and who will guide you in a way that is sound and effective then moira stott is someone you will truly appreciate on so many levels other teachers whose teaching style i really enjoy are hilary burnett her intermediate program is incredible and jennifer kries i also like ana caban and michelle dozois for variety in my practice highly recommended ! ||| 1

definitely a great movie rules of engagement brings to the screen two stories as they unfold simultaneously that of a military investigation into whether an officer in the marines was in violation of the code of conduct during an incident in yemen and the inner struggle of the lawyer as he tries to come to terms with his past and the ghosts that have been haunting him ever since vietnam the film combines drama action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind needless to say tommy lee jones samuel jackson and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! the plot the setting the dialogues the special effects and the music are all wonderful ! in short it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection if you have n't already done so ! ! strongly recommended along with black hawk down a few good men and courage under fire ||| 1
unlike marshall fine who wrote the amazon review i do n't find the subplot in this movie hard to swallow at all ! sadly politically i believe many of our fine military personnel have been sacrificed through the years for political agenda and i am not just talking about recently i am sure there are flaws in the movie but i was n't watching the movie for flaws truthfully military movies are not my favorite genre having said that i found myself up very late one night and happened upon '' this fine movie i was mesmerized tommy lee jones and samuel jackson were brilliant but it was the short segment with the former officer in the north vietnamese army that riveted my attention more than any other scene just brilliant ! i ca n't say more or i will spoil it for anyone who has not seen it needless to say i give it 5 stars because it is a movie that made me think one i will talk about in years to come that 's a barometer for my ! ||| 1
i 'd seen this film before in a lesser unrestored edition and was n't that impressed sure there 's some moments worth a chuckle or two but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull hardly the unintentional laugh riot it 's reputed to be thanks to mike nelson 's biting commentary however now the film really is funny damn funny which is why i demand we pass legislation the sooner the better requiring mike nelson commentaries on every major dvd release from here on out he may be hollywood 's last best hope the only man who can save excrement like mission impossible 3 and lady in the water from heading straight to the bargain racks okay maybe i 'm overrating mike 's abilities just a bit nothing short of an old miracle could scrape the stink off of lady in the water but if lucas gave him a crack at episodes i think we 'd be looking at pure marketing gold c'mon lucas you know you ca n't resist any excuse to yet another dvd version of your little sextology give the man a call ||| 1
ok folks this is by far one of the best dvds i 've bought in quite awhile you get so much for so little first you get the original black and white movie reefer madness is like the three stooges black and white just adds to its charm but to see it in color is quite a hoot the smoke is purple and pink the suits and dresses are loud and the color scheme for mae 's apartment is just mind boggling what more could you ask for well you get more anyway when i discovered that mike nelson from fame actually had narrating duty i just had to buy reefer madness again he 's hilarious sure it would have been great for his two robot buddies to join in but who knows maybe someday mike was right on the ball and i laughed out loud quite a few times i never noticed before how much time the dope dealer spent making meals and eating well if that was n't enough we also get a short 15 minute film starring grandpa ganja he 's a marijuana expert who 's been smoking pot for over 30 years he quotes weed from the bible convincingly explains how moses was a major dopehead and also the disciples not only do we get an indepth history on marijuana he demonstrates how to roll a joint smoke a bong and other helpful hints on how to administer medical thc the old man is hilarious on helpful hints as to buying and growing your marijuana when they showed the real old dude throwing marijuana seeds over his fence and then harvesting pot in his neighbor 's yard i lost it low brow pot humor true but in any case i laughed my butt off if you already have a black and white copy of reefer madness it 's worth buying again to have this edition it 's well worth it ||| 1
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it has it all suspense good acting good story line and without much violence the plot is interesting it keeps you guessing and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat great job hollywood to all involved with this film especially jodi foster ||| 1
cary grant audrey hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes james coburn and a killer '' soundtrack by henry mancini deserve much better treatment than they get in this dvd with absolutely no special features this comic murder mystery shows off its stars to their finest in spite of a less than admirable film transfer it 's all thanks to the great performances tongue in cheek direction and witty screenplay hopefully a better quality and enhanced dvd version will replace this one in your film library nonetheless charade '' remains a charming and timeless classic ||| 1
up until now basic instinct '' has always been that little movie in pop culture in which sharon stone uncrosses her legs and exposes her vagina for an instant after watching this movie that is exactly what i 'll remember it for this movie is pop culture staple it 's stupid and impossible to predict as soon as you think you 've got it you do n't only to discover you do as we we see with the ending the movie what critics refer to as a bad movie '' and it is however people will forget gandhi '' the best picture winner of 1980 something before they forget this movie if you label your dvd collection this would definitley be in the guilty pleasure '' section where you would also find movies like wild things '' and cruel intentions '' it 's a movie that has big stars a big budget and a stupid story but this all works perfectly oscar winner michael douglas best actor wall street plays detective nick curran an and smoker who 's investigating the murder of a former rock star the person believed to have commited the murder is catherine tramell stone a novelist who 's novel has detailed the killing exactly as nick discovers more about the case he finds simalar incidences involving catherine and at the same time he begins an affair with her probably not the best thing to do when you 're pretty damn sure she 's killing people with ice picks the movie is packed with cliches and occasional bad dialouge that is only annoying sometimes oddly enough douglas and stone are perfect in their roles stone catches the feroscity sexuality and glamour of catherine perfectly and douglas plays the vulnerable yet tough cop perfectly as well i ca n't see another actor in any of these roles which is one of the highest compliments i think an actor can recieve while it looks like douglas made the smart decision by not returning for the sequel i look forward to seeing stone playing catherine tramell again in the movie so film buffs who actually know what a best boy grip is probably wo n't like this movie but entertainment seekers will surely like it and hell if you do n't even care if it 's a good movie the sex scenes are great in reality however very entertaining ||| 1
i have a little brother who is 7 and severely disabled he 's on a 9 month old level not much catches his eye but one day when he was throwing a tantrum i put it on nick jr and noticed he stopped crying when he heard the sound of the singing backyardigans he could n't stop looking at the colorful show is a lifesaver ! it kept him entertained for the whole i 'd heard about the show from a friend who has a 1 yr old who loves the show and she told me to try it out i took her advice and my brother loved it ! and as soon as i saw it on vhs i bought loves the snow fort '' but his favorite is the yeti '' he laughs the whole time the penguin sings the yeti stomp '' i also bought him it great to be a ghost '' dvd for recommend this for any little children it works like a charm ||| 1
this is the masterpiece of atheist spanish film director an unrelentless devastating unmerciful criticism of religion yes it can be viewed as a social satire a political vehicle etc that 's what makes it a great film that you can view it from different perspectives to me the most valuable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see as in a wide canvass the soul and mind of this great atheist man it is revealing that took to the task of proving '' religion wrong and absurd with so intense passion and would even desperation because no one is more desperate than he who searches and ca n't find but as unamuno would say to explain the angst of the author it comes from seeking to believe with the reason and not with the life the film depicts spain 's social condition pretty accurately in those years unamuno explains this aspect though he wrote decades before 's work as follows in france and spain there are multitudes who have proceeded from rejecting popery to absolute atheism because 'the fact is that false and absurd doctrines when exposed have a natural tendency to beget scepticism in those who received them without reflection none are so likely to believe too little as those who have begun by believing too much ' '' another important aspect of the film is the way he depicts the poor helplessly incorrigible lacking as much in money as in human virtues and extremely ugly and repealing it is very curious how did not even allow any little space for sentimentality or candidness i mean there is no hero or anything even close to it it 's a terrible portrait of the human soul i would say pessimistic but i do n't think would agree he would probably prefer sincere or realistic the symbolism is so evident that any private school kid could figure it out so forcibly paired are the scenes with their objects of criticism and trying to make it so evident and not as difficult as other of his surrealistic films evidences his intensity of feeling his anger his hatred of all that despises religion and not only catholicism just happened to be but universal religion going back to the the poor in the film being a communist sympathizer it is ironic that he does n't show even a little mercy with his poor i think the rich young man is a more admirable figure than any of his other characters the female protagonist the nun who gives up her vows being used only as a tool can not be expected to represent all nuns or all religious persons would be a case that in real life might happen isolatedly should not be used to prove a general rule it is dishonest but there is a correlation between his view of the economically poor and the christian view '' for the poor you have with you always but me you do not have always '' john is n't there something of the same nature so how can one conception of the poor lead christians to love them nevertheless knowing that they will always be around and the furious to despise them maybe not to condemn them because surely society or the rich '' would take the blame well that question is for everybody to meditate on i wish people like would give christ a chance unamuno another great spaniard says note the greater part of our atheists and you will see that they are atheists from a kind of rage rage at not being able to believe that there is a god they are the personal enemies of god '' but how can you be an enemy of someone who does not exist however this is a great and splendid work of art but now ending with a quote from rousseau where is the philosopher who would not willingly deceive mankind for his own glory with believers he is an atheist with atheists he would be a believer the essential thing is to think differently from others '' nevertheless it moves ! ||| 1

this dvd shows shania 's potential as a serious musician with alison krauss and union station as her back up here she is simply riveting too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like up ! '' instead of making enduring popular country classics like the woman in me '' and come on over '' maybe she 's living too well nowadays to make soulful music get this dvd if you want to hear shania doing something good 4 stars is for the short length of this dvd we need at least 2 hours of this awesome music not the 50 minutes which is on this dvd that 's only enough time to drink 5 beers ||| 1
you ca n't really call yourself a pauly shore fan unless you love and it 's hard not to love this movie granted it is prone to a bit of cheesiness but this is what we both love and respect about pauly shore becca is a fresh from the farm in south dakota now in california at college and on her own for the first time she misses her family and her jock boyfriend back home and feels like she does n't fit in but crawl pauly shore in perfect pauly form her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be when the holidays roll around crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for thanksgiving but becca insists he join her and her family in south dakota crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that 's not enough to make things silly becca 's boyfriend tries to propose to her but becca does n't want to get married yet and crawl announces to the family that he 's already proposed to becca now absolute silliness takes over and it 's just so much fun from here on out if you need something fun and funny to watch give a try one of my favorites in my collection of silly comedies you 'll love it ||| 1
naysayers have proclaimed this neglected gem as depressing and but perhaps they are just scared of seeing a movie starlet get truly real '' and show us the ugly truths about celebrity asia 's film would make a good double bill with dogville to make audiences realize the commonality between star worship and cannibalism argento pulls no punches she splatters herself all over each frame even introducing the film in a video prelude she should be recognized as a hero instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a exhibitionist but i bet if a man made this film these selfsame critics would line up to praise it obviously many feminists of both sexes are still secretly terrified and intimidated when a women dares to actually show her real '' self they are all the more angry because their reactions remind them they are not as ready to hear the truly liberated '' female voice as they might like to think i say asia has created something truly new with scarlet diva it 's ahead of its time and will one day be recognized as the forerunner of a brave new kind of chick flick ||| 1

ok this series is n't exactly like the final fantasy games but the elements are there for instance you have chocobo 's you have cactuar 's you have the summoning of guardian forces which by the way look really cool you have character 's which have too much power for their own good and a journey this journey is that of ai and yu 's search for their parents where they are accompanied by lisa pacifist a woman who possesses the cool power of kigen arts during their journey they see and do many wonderous things in wonderland i wont say anymore i dont want to spoil too much of the plot i have this product rated as stars but actually i think there it should be stars i really enjoyed this series but i dock it points because the time length adv gives the series to be is inadequate they say it is total 625 minutes where actually each episode is 45 sec thus 22.75 min 25 568.75 minutes long total length of series anywho if you like final fantasy i suggest watch this series ||| 1
i rented terror train 1980 with a friend of mine about ten years ago and i remember after we watched it we were both like is that it '' not recalling what our criticisms of the film were at the time but i decided to give it another chance and you know what i liked it i really did i 'll grant you it 's not an outstanding feature but the effort is there resulting in an overall solid film directed by roger spottiswoode the pursuit of cooper turner hooch tomorrow never dies the movie stars jamie lee curtis the fog trading places a fish called wanda who a couple years earlier had appeared in a little horror feature you may have heard of called halloween 1978 also appearing is ben johnson hang 'em high red dawn hart bochner breaking away supergirl die hard derek mckinnon breaking all the rules sandee currie terminal choice timothy webber the hotel new hampshire and david copperfield who was at one time engaged to supermodel claudia schiffer but called it off as their relationship interfered with his work earning himself a place in the the f ' hall of fame as the movie opens it 's new year 's eve and the boys at the sigma phi omega house are having a party after a prank directed at one of the spaz fraternity pledges goes horribly wrong we fast forward three years and see another new year 's eve bash in the offing this time a costume affair taking place on an excursion train hosted by doc bochner and mo webber two of the fraternity brothers responsible for the prank that occurred three years ago also in attendance is alana curtis mo 's girlfriend who was also involved in the prank but not to the extent to being fully aware of what exactly doc and mo had planned resulting in some bad blood between her and doc who was essentially the ringleader and a real to boot anyway turns out the nerdlinger who was the victim of the gag is now a dangerous homicidal psychopath has decided this a good opportunity to exact his revenge by sneaking on board the train and murdering all those who wrong him back in the day actually it was a pretty good move because not only is most everyone disguised in costumes but they 're also stoned drunk and easy pickings also the trip is an all night deal with no place to stop so once the fun begins it wo n't end until it ends eventually those on board learn there 's a killer among them after the corpses start piling up but he could be disguised as anyone so who 's to be trusted oh yeah a magician played by david copperfield is also on board for the purpose of entertaining the rubes performing his illusions never call them tricks as that really ticks him off like i said i liked this canadian produced movie at least the time around i 'm not sure what changed other than the fact i 'm older but i think i have a bit more appreciation for the effort put into developing the characters within the film i believe this helped especially in terms of jamie lee curtis ' character as we saw she had real empathy for the kid who got tricked not so long ago apparently she tried to visit him after he ended up in the hospital along with strong disliking for the person whom she saw responsible for the prank that being doc a self centered manipulative type mostly for his cruelty but also because of the way he used her in his scheme the result of all this was an effort to make us feel for curtis ' character in that maybe she did n't deserve the same fate as the rest and it work for me at least the movie does fall within the ' realm but gore hounds will most likely be disappointed as there 's actually very little bloodletting violence spottiswoode in his directorial debut instead seems to be focusing on the suspenseful build up rather than on the visceral material normally present within the genre i thought there was some very decent scares throughout the film i did n't jump out of my seat or anything but the movie did keep my attention the goofy bits for me was how well the killer was able to keep his identity hidden even after those on the train realized who was the one responsible for the killings the story does throw around a red herring or two but at one point before his identity on the train is revealed you should be able to discern which passenger he is there was a definite sense of claustrophobia as most of the film takes place on train that has only three or four cars but then this also made the difficulty for those trying to find the killer seem all that much more well dumb one element that did n't really help was the amount of time spent watching david copperfield perform his magic his character who seemed quite smarmy to me did figure into the plot but it just felt like his lengthy performances were included to help pad out a decent running time i do n't mind magic but i would have preferred there not to have been as much as there was since this was supposed to be a horror film it was kind of funny though given how seriously he takes his craft to see him stuck on an excursion train having to impress a bunch of drunken college kids i did like the bit after the main conductor played ben johnson discovered the first body and attributes the death as being caused by kid messed up on dope ' as far as curtis her presence here did help a lot and probably resulted in quite a few seats being filled at the time of the movie 's release given her prominence of queen ' in the late she had all of three films out in 1980 this one along with the fog and prom night overall i found this to be a fairly engaging film one that rises slightly above that of your slasher feature the picture quality presented in anamorphic widescreen looks decent enough and the audio available in both dolby digital mono and stereo comes across well there 's really not much in the way of extras other than a theatrical trailer for the film and subtitles available in both english and spanish ||| 1
up until last years match point crimes and misdemeanors was considered woody allen 's last great film i 've only seen 3 woody allen films not counting match point that came out after c m and before mp but i 'd have to agree crimes misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with allen 's greatest work films like the purple rose of cairo and annie hall it 's a perfect blend of drama and comedy in fact match point was kind of a retread of this film the drama without the comedy this movie stars martin landau 'ed wood ' as judah rosenthal an i do n't remember the term for one who 's been having an affair with a woman named dolores anjelica huston 'buffalo 66 ' problem is he 's tried to break it off but dolores is n't having it she 's instead threatened to expose his infidelity to his wife he 's barely intercepted the letters he looks to a patient a rabbi sam waterston 'the killing fields ' for help but it 's not working when he turns to his mobster brother jack jerry orbach 'law order ' for help jack suggests murder judah reluctantly gives in meanwhile a filmmaker named cliff stern allen is tapped by his lester alan alda 'mahattan murder mystery ' to make a documentary special on him cliff hates lester but is n't getting work anywhere else while working on it cliff meets halley reed mia farrow 'rosemary 's baby ' whom he falls for despite being married in typical woody allen style the film is fueled mostly by conversations between the main characters i liked his ploy of showing clips of old movies as a character was watching them that kind of went over what was occurring in his own movie the movie is separated into comedy and drama kind of like allen 's melinda and melinda '' the drama part is the judah plot the comedy is the cliff plot although both of them drift into the other category occasionally they both finally come together at the end the movie simultaneously reminded me of match point and manhattan the former for obvious reasons the latter because the endings are similar in what happens to allen 's character anyway the acting is great of course as is the dialogue as always there 's a lot of great i have n't been inside a woman since i visited the statue of liberty '' and some physical bits of humor as well if you 're a fan of woody allen you 'll definitely love it grade ||| 1
this is such a fun movie to watch it is so goofy and ridicualous and you never get tired of watching it encino man and pauly shore is one of the reasons why the early ruled there are so many cool scenes in this like when stoney takes link to and they cruise the aisles looking for some grindeage to munch on and when they go to the mountian and ride the viper in reverse and the drivers ed scene when link thinks it is rad mobile and he puts it up on two wheels and they end up at the bar with all the mexicans you see that girl muchacho dont look at her ! '' the prom scene was cool to it had infectious grooves in it they are a real band but that song was made for the movie the singer and bass player are in suicidal tendencies and the bass player plays for metallica now but anyways yeah this movie is totally radical daves room is really cool to i wish my room was that rad the school looks cool too i wish my high school was like that i notice that whenever i watch something like this that was filmed in the early everything seemed real bright and cheerful am i crazy or has anyone else noticed this pauly shores punch lines and phrases never get old they age like a fine wine ||| 1
i 've also reviewed the first two volumes but i honestly believe that volume three is the best i plan on getting them all and have the entire series for the first time in my life but if i had to pick a single best volume it would be this one from russia with love has the most solid cold war story of all the films and everyone is firing on all pistons connery is bond in this one making the character his own and robert shaw and lotte lenya as the villians are among the best on her majesty 's secret service is george lazenby 's only film and it remains a controversial entry in the series myself i loved it diana rigg is awesome the photography and editing are great and the story feels like it has more meat on its bones than any other film these first two films probably come closest to the ian fleming novels live and let die is moore 's first appearance as bond it has a hit paul mccartney wings song and a jane seymour along with a very charismatic villian in yaphet kotto the boat chase is still thrilling and sheriff pepper is still hilarious goldeneye is brosnan 's first appearance as bond and remains his best film wonderful use of russian locales particularly the graveyard '' of communist statues and the deadliest bond girl since pussy galore for your eyes only was an attempt to get back to better stories after the overblown epics of the seventies so as far as i 'm concerned there is n't a bad one in the lot like i said i plan on getting them all but this one looks like the best enjoy ||| 1

i knew that i wanted this movie but i had forgotten much of the plot it is a pleasure to view this one and recall that movies could be humorous without being decadent that adventure could be portrayed without endless special effects or digital animation or dissonant music '' and that the more leisurely pace was relaxing SMILE suffice to say that both my wife and i found it very enjoyable ! the extra clips were fascinating background on making of the movie one should not miss reviewing them the effort spent on the aircraft alone added a considerable touch of reality ||| 1
stagecoach '' is significant along with destry rides again '' for redefining the western for adult '' audiences director john ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences for sure the film does contain a number of western archetypes the gambler the prostitute with a heart of gold etc but they transcend the stereotypes stagecoach '' is also significant as the film that broke john wayne to mainstream audiences wayne 's entrance as the ringo kid is the stuff of legends there is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated claire trevor as the social pariah dallas and thomas mitchell as doc boone for which he won an oscar the film 's status as being historically significant is not debatable as first class entertainment it is timeless ||| 1
what do you get when you have rock the devil 's son and adam sandler playing the devil 's son you get little is the strangest movie adam sandler has possibly ever played in you have two of the devil 's sons who want to be the devil themselves and you have nicky the nice as can be devil does n't think any of his children are good enough to take his place yet until he tells them nicky could care less but his two brothers are and leaving it impossible for souls to enter or except for must leave his do gooder life and head to earth and save his father and all the humans in a left hell he now has only himself and a little dog companion beefy nicky has to learn to live a humans life and capture his two twisted brothers in a mystical those two and the fact that he ca n't release the evil '' nicky finds himself dazed and movie had some really cool side characters like two music is awsome with some good old and the comedy is actually say the jokes are kinda lame in this film i could n't find a reason to critique this movie extras are great featuring an in depth look at metal bands and rock in general a must rent ||| 1
this is a fun art house '' movie fun because the script is tight and the acting top notch and you know from the start you are in the hands of a good director just the kind of thing you want from a night at an art house not a message movie like many such films but instead film making and three cheers for that campbell scott plays the smooth player who tutors his nephew nick jesse eisenberg on how to get laid the action takes place mostly in one night of bar and party hopping this script is so good that any bar lizard could learn from the lines and strategy used by scott 's character scott 's character is an accomplished and dedicated player who never sees the wrong in his ways and that is the delicious and honest part of the film one review talked about the player venting his anger at women but my take was that he stayed in control the entire movie venting naturally and within limits when he was thrown over by his like him or hate him the player is a pro from beginning to end the viewer has to decide whether he likes or dislikes women in the final analysis what matters is how well campbell scott 's character plays the game and he is a rodger dodger in an age of politically correct repression how refreshing ! five stars out of five ||| 1

the postman always rings twice is the epitome of how sublime the film noir genre can be the story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome into murdering her much older husband based on the novel by james cain and boasting the stylish performances of lana turner and john garfield this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic over half a century later we are still singing it 's praises from lana turner 's memorable entrance as cora smith clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills the drifter frank chambers garfield is so completely infatuated that murder can be as easy as picking up a lipstick case cecil kellaway karl malden and hume cronyn the new dvd from warners includes a fantastic documentary about john garfield plus and trailers technical details aspect ratio fullscreen disc snapper case audio english mono french mono german mono spanish mono subtitles english french german spanish portugese dutch danish icelandic croatian slovenian hungarian swedish czech greek polish romanian arabic english hearing impaired german hearing impaired ||| 1
you ca n't wipe murder off our hands well perhaps you can especially if you 're like the two main protagonists in the postman always rings twice an absolutely marvelous movie of dark despair and foggy murky paranoia based on the novel by james cain the movie is all about the terrible consequences that can result from unchecked desire and obsession the sexy john garfield stars as frank chambers a tough enigmatic drifter from san francisco who arrives in the small california town of twin oaks frank 's a pretty rough and tumble sort of guy he 's a little lazy and a bit of a con artist but he 's decent enough and soon he gets offered a job in a diner run by nick smith cecil kellaway nick is very eager to employ frank but frank initially hesitates that is until he meets nick 's much younger wife cora smith a gorgeous lana turner cora is a blonde bombshell a real knockout first appearing in front of frank in skimpy shorts she 's even photographed from the legs up cora is a teasingly sexy femme fatale rolling her lipstick towards him in a hesitant dance of seduction perhaps a promise of what is to come the sexual attraction is almost immediate and as the tension steadily builds they begin a clandestine affair taking moonlit swims together while the affable nick remains totally unsuspecting of what 's going on soon cora confesses to frank that she does n't love her husband and she that married nick to give her a sense of security desperately in love the two decide to run away together by hitching but cora decides she does n't want to start life again with nothing and returns to the diner by this time frank ca n't get cora out of his head and with both of them feeling ever more trapped they decide to arrange an accident for her unsuspecting husband but their plan does n't quite work the situation becomes even worse when the local da leon ames catches onto them and their evil schemes the plot takes many twists and turns as cora and frank try to outmaneuver the law nick and also a pair of unscrupulous lawyers who are intent to see the sultry couple and sell out on each other despite the imposition of strict censorship laws the postman always rings twice bubbles over with passion even though much of the sensuality is suggested and because the censors would n't allow any sex or violence the filmmakers had to imply what was going on so the film projects an undercurrent of barely disguised passions sexuality and murder the censorship restrictions also make the performances of garfield and turner that much stronger relying on sharp dialogue and facial expressions the actors manage to weave a gorgeous sensual dance together both lighting up the screen and creating two of the most smolderingly complex characters ever seen in film the postman always rings twice is a classical noir tale of love that just goes disastrously wrong lust deceit lies and betrayal inevitably result because the two lovers just ca n't let go of each other and are trapped by their desires cora is dreadfully insecure and wants something in life that has always eluded her and frank is too caught up in his feelings for cora to see reason he 's just too to see how warped his judgment has become the postman always rings twice was remade in 1981 with jessica lange and jack nicholson in the lead roles i 've never seen it but hearsay suggests that although it is much steamier minus the restrictive censorship laws this version is still far superior even after all these years with its edgy character development it 's stylish photography and with turner and garfield as the leads it is indeed a terrific film and remains a verifiable masterpiece of hollywood film noir mike leonard july 05 ||| 1
i was reluctant to watch almost famous '' because i figured it would be chock full of hype but for some reason i decided to finally sit down and watch this story and i 'm glad i did i thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music music journalism fandom and groupies most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized and i appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective i especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully '' they do n't even know what it is to be a fan you know to truly love some silly little piece of music or some band so much that it hurts '' although i am not and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination i am an avid music aficionado i thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of fandom perfectly i liked the way cameron crowe humanized the groupies sure some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars and they do have feelings just like anyone else and i thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of penny lane '' i can remember when back in the groupies were little celebrities '' themselves so sersonally i do n't think that people should label them as tramps or judge them too harshly besides who knows maybe someone you know or may be related to may have a sweet little secret '' they 've been keeping along these years it was the after all some of those rockers got around and some apparently ordinary girls did too fact some of those gals just did what many of us wished we could do and they were for the most part honest about it at any rate the music used in the movie is just awesome ! it sure was fun to hear go all the way '' by the raspberries as well as tiny dancer '' by elton john how could you not sing along to that classic now that i 've been reading the reviews about the bootleg '' director 's cut i 'm going to have to watch that one too ||| 1
best men surprised me very much i was n't expecting such a delightful if a little bit depressing movie directed by tamra davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor this movie is one of those you smile most of the time and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot luke wilson plays jesse a convict getting out of prison after a theft and who is getting married to his sweetheart hope drew barrymore along for the ride are his best friends dean cain as a former green beret who is gay mitchell whitfield as the lawyer saul who was wilson 's lawyer andy dick as the nerdy teddy who is in a bad marriage and sean patrick flannery who plays billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks billy does n't tell his buddies that he 's planning on robbing a bank before the wedding but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff fred ward who also happens to be billy 's father ! soon the inevitably nasty fbi comes in headed by the sadistic and cold agent played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable raymond barry dead man walking the chamber the movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale this dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest brad dourif gives one of his best performances since cuckoo 's nest '' as the mentally challenged vietnam vet fred ward dean cain sean patrick flannery and mitchell whitfield are also excellent it 's the best work i 've seen cain do the movie entertained me immensely and i would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy ! or is it a comic drama cheers ||| 1

no he does n't angel heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective harry angel and lou cyphere obviously the devil well not obvious to me at first ha ! the only bad part about this movie is the fuss people made over it the voodoo dance scenes were apparently fairly in keeping with tradition voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a devil '' character since there is no devil figure in voodoo however the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices it just happens to be how the devil got involved with johnney the missing crooner mickey rourke is stellar in this is enchanting deniro is flawless worth owning ! ||| 1
this was much much better than i expected it to be a real tear jerker if i was to let myself cry this movie would 've been it not the joy luck club '' andy garcia surely deserved an oscar nomination he was simply great i was not a big fan of his but here he clearly impressed me of course he was also terrific in the godfather part 3 '' meg ryan was effective but still a little too cutsey with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films but the two daughters were outstanding especially the older one played by tina majorino who appears to be about 7 or 8. also the look of the film set in san francisco is good especially the interiors of their house garcia really seems to care about ryan this movie is about love and how it does n't always carry the day with alcoholics i also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things they 've been married and had a kid you do n't learn til much later that he is not the older kid 's dad and we see her drink a lot they do n't start with how they fell in love or even attempt to explain why she 's an alcoholic smart ||| 1

i 'm not going to try to get all the characters names right in yi yi and there are a lot of characters an extended family and various lovers and children taiwan is a modern impressive city a place rarely seen on american television or film i might be looking at manhattan rather than taipei the computer engineer 's family the wife with spiritual emptiness the teen daughter involved in her first serious sexual activity the grandmother on life support and the old son teased to exhaustion by little girls they live in a condominium over a raised superhighway then there 's the so superstitious that he marries his pregnant wife only on a chinese lucky day his old girlfriend shows up at the wedding to raise hell she returns at the babies chinese confirmation for more of the same a fight breaks out kicking little men and screechy women our engineer had walked away from a young love and while wife is with the monks he renews the relationship on a business trip to tokyo he is in love so is she but i ca n't tell you what happens without giving away this poignant part of the plot engineer 's daughter is having a rather unusual fling as well i 've left out a ton of information as this film was close to three hours long but watch the beautiful cinematography of edward yang and his brilliant pacing one thinks it is real life ||| 1

when i am watching a 1984 movie i am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns some may call it predictible but myself i feel that the story flowed and made sense too many times have i seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere tom sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop gene simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his kiss type persona and plays the evil genius well i for one enjoyed this movie alot and unlike blade runner did n't find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line if you are looking for a believeable near future story pick this up ||| 1
house of strangers is a cautionary film about the dangers of hatred being passed onto the next generation almost as if hatred were an old and unwelcome pair of shoes edward is gino moretti a banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral in his over the top performance as an italian who might have been vito coreleone had the don chosen to go straight robinson is a totally egomaniac who comes off more as a smug biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations it is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there it is only max richard conte who can see if only belatedly the vision of his father and even max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers max can not do this alone he requires the understanding first of maria debra paget then later helen susan hayward both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within gino moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons '' who do you think i built this bank for '' generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father the difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may in similar situations have emerged what goes around truly comes around and house of strangers continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche ||| 1
before anything else i agree with those who say that keaton 's shorts are all good but i strongly disagree with those who say that they are better than his better features what usually happens with comedy is that people sit down before the screen and just say ok make me laugh keaton 's features are funny they are also and more important beautifully shot superbly acted and perfectly structured is something only the best can put all together there are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20 's keaton 's characters move in the real world with real things and that 's part of what makes them lasting and unique in your shelves keaton should n't share his place with the marx brothers but with orson welles who called the general the best movie ever made about the civil war and martin scorsese who said he watched over and over the final fight in battling butter by the way is not supposed to make you laugh but to surprise you with it 's realism now this are the complete contents of this dvd set aside from it you should check out the buster keaton collection which includes the cameraman spite marriage and free and easy and then you are done well you could also read the only book he wrote wonderful world of slapstick june update industrial strength keaton '' dvd just came out the set includes rare industrial films promotional films commercials tv appearances and outtakes the saphead 1920 includes the shorts one week 1920 and the high sign 1920 the three ages year 1923 including the goat 1921 and my wife 's relation 1922 our hospitality sherlock year the navigator year 1924 includes shorts the boat 1921 and the love nest 1923 go west year 1925 includes the scarecrow 1920 and the paleface 1921 seven chances year 1925 shorts neighbors 1920 the balloonatic 1923 battling butler year 1926 includes the haunted house 1921 and frozen north 1922 the general year 1926 shorts the playhouse 1921 and cops 1922 college year 1927 includes the electric house 1922 hard luck in this version the ending is missing but the complete version is found in the disc called keaton plus 1921 and the blacksmith 1922 steamboat bill year 1928 shorts convict 13 1920 and daydreams 1922 keaton plus year color home movies complete short hard luck two shorts from the 30 's commercials tv shows and appearances but best of all orson welles talking about keaton and the general ||| 1
i love agressive ski videos that just kick and storm just rips no stupid bikini skiing or inner tube follies that i can remember just great skiing superbly shot with an awesome soundtrack my neighbors can hear me when i play this they think i have a screw loose ||| 1
as a moderate skiier and a filmmaker myself this hits it home for me warren miller films are always shown locally and there 's hardly anything imaginable that could make me miss his new movie every year not being a heavy metal fan historically the music tends to be distracting alas this past year 's edition storm '' had just the right amount of pizazz and flare to make it my favorite yet there are moments nearly every year that i take home with me but storm was filled with the most amazing skiing some of the most unique locations and might add the most exhilarating editing i 've seen in quite a while ! kudos to you folks ! if you can appreciate the splendor of mountain island skiing that harldy anyone on earth has even seen let alone skiied then this dvd will certainly expediate your plans for skiing this coming season you might not go to south georgia island but there 's plenty of skiing nearby just roadtrip and split a cabin ||| 1
this recommendation is for the uncut version of leon the professional a well crafted tightly edited excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll an action film that can be appreciated by those who generally do n't care for the genre the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it if you 're looking for something worthwhile to watch check this one out ||| 1
luc besson 's the professional '' raises the stakes of besson 's playful theme by making the heroine a played by a then unknown natalie portman in the making of the professional '' besson says if i imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter i kill the guy in five seconds i kill him and i think it 's in me i 'm a beast ! '' on this part we ca n't forget that a part of us the genetic things inside are much much older than the ten commandments '' he certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie the blood running from mathilda 's nose or stansfield 's unforgettable everyone ! '' are just a couple of examples the music and the sound are good and are used in a masterly fashion you can hear fat man 's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when stansfield turns to look at mathilda 's father leon however does not work only on this primary level it also has an intelligent story it may seem to be almost a but do n't be fooled just like his character besson is serious this movie has a message without love we are dead even if we do n't see it only true love give meaning to our lives everything else reminds me a big yogurt warm and rancid '' as mathilda says in the original script which is available on the net under the name leon version 1. is this true in real life '' i do n't know but this movie can make you wonder then of course there 's the sensuality it 's hypocritical to deny it the camera interacts with mathilda in a mesmerizing fashion it 's not sick and it 's not degrading its art subtle and beautiful leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven it 's a movie that really should not be missed unless you are concerned with its amorality and do n't be leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact ||| 1
love shelly long movies and bette midler too this is very enjoyable and funny was thrilled to have found a copy on amazon ||| 1

royal wedding has been a favorite in the fred astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago astaire and jane powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film and astaire 's dance on the ceiling you 're all the world to me '' is classic the score by burton lane of finian 's rainbow fame and alan jay lerner future lyricist of my fair lady is unbeatable i need not comment further on the film 's merits it speaks for itself the film is now in the public domain and unfortunately nearly all vhs and dvd releases of such films are deplorable at best that is not so in this case the dvd i 'm commenting on here is from goodtimes dvd edition and i must say that the transfer looks pretty darn good for a pd film the picture is clear for the most part and although there are some minor color shifts and artifacts present they do not distract colors are fairly bold and are well defined the soundtrack is pretty clear and sounds fine there are no extras i have a very old copy of the vhs tape from home video and also a vhs dub i did off turner classic movies two years ago and honestly this dvd looks better than both it is about as good as we can expect for a pd film that has not been restored from original elements goodtimes is often better than most in their releases of pd films it could be a lot worse warner home video which controls release rights to the rest of the old mgm library has not given us a studio dvd release of royal wedding as yet and as far as i know none is in the works if you want royal wedding on dvd i absolutely recommend this goodtimes dvd release it is probably the best one you 'll find is at a very good price and comes in very nice packaging recommended ||| 1

there 's only one word to describe this movie suhweeeeeeeet ! despite the dozens of imitators bloodsport was the first and best of its kind from the classic training sequence where young frank dux masters the martial arts and receives the katana he coveted as a boy to the motley group of tournament fighters with their goofy fighting techniques to the repeated chanting of ! ! ! '' on the pounding soundtrack there 's hardly a moment that wo n't have you pumped and calling for more the only parts that do n't quite work are the chase scenes and a young forest whittaker who seems not to have completely understood what sort of production he was appearing in but they do n't detract from the main attraction beatdowns and plenty of 'em this is a quintessential guys ' movie and if you have n't seen it you owe it to yourself to check it out ||| 1
this 1988 gore film i ca n't call it anything else since it 's not a horror film in the classic sense features an ensemble of treat williams most notably from the substitute '' series of movies and comedian joe piscopo known for his years on saturday night live and comedy impersonating the likes of frank sinatra and david letterman among others the two play cops williams is roger and joe is his partner doug the back of the vhs gives a detailed description of the film plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie lindsay frost plays the stereotypical innocent '' woman caught up in everything that 's going on around her but the corpse of the situation deals with roger getting shot and coming back to life he must solve a case within so many hours or he 'll turn into ashes and as the hours progress naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally darren mcgavin plays the part of an evil doctor vincent price plays in a scene or two and he 's revealed to be the mastermind behind the resurrection room at the dante lab he plays a guy named loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead the movie is gory and and it succeeds in being a good parody of the lethal weapon 'buddy cop ' films even though it probably was n't intended to be the first time around but that 's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for films but those who like that kind of film will love this one it 's not so gore and so stomach turning it ca n't be seen several times like many of the texas chainsaw films are but dead heat '' is gory compared to other action films of this era starring charles bronson clint eastwood or mel gibson i give it 4 stars for the story cast and acting minus 1 star for the gore factor ||| 1
i thought this dvd set was halarious ! i was hoping it would n't be the case where i saw it before and remembered it to be funnier than it really was but that was not the case it truely was one of the funniest seasons of a comedy show i 've ever seen ! i wonder if the cast has some sort of deal with sprite though because you see so many current and former cast members from this show in those commercials for sprite anyone care to comment on this my favorite skits are probably the movie satires and the one with michael jackson doing an infomercial is halarious ! i also like the rap video with ice cube in prison doing a song about acting etc just phenomenally halarious ! mc white said check it out ! ! ||| 1
i 'm a big fan of roseanne so it was no surprise to me that the halloween edition would n't be great tina ||| 1
this show was excellent in every aspect i was captivated from the opening number and stayed glued to my tv until the closing credits it was so fun to see the entire osmond clan decked out in their holiday finest having such a wholesome and lighthearted good time i especially enjoyed seeing debbie donny 's wife sing a duet with donny and the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well there was even a guest appearance by the osmond grandparents i would recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned christmas special there is a mixture of traditional christmas songs some uptempo numbers and even some spiritual songs included a particularly poignant segment included little brother jimmy singing a song out in the snow i 'd never seen the two older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show one of the best christmas specials i 've seen in a long time it made me wish that i was part of their family after watching this i 'm more convinced than ever that i am the fat osmond who mother osmond abandoned in the hospital only to be adopted by some nice folks here in the pacific northwest ||| 1
my daughter is 17 months old and next to rock and roll this is probably her least favorite of the sesame street movies and we have a lot of them if your child is like mine and likes the characters she sees a lot of on sesame street elmo ernie cookie grover etc they might not be as interested in this one although elmo is the cohost of the awards show with herry it is nice to see the monsters that do n't get a lot of play though herry monster is in about half of the songs it is worth it if you do n't have any videos with monster in the mirror also on rock and roll fuzzy and blue on sesame street anniversary or c is for cookie on several of the dvds ||| 1
one of the best films i have seen captures the lack of humanity and humanity of this world simaltaneously humanises conflict has the ability to make you laugh and cry draws attention to the plight of children and humanises the children of the middle east i would recommend this film to everyone with a conscience as essential viewing having said that it did plunge me into depression so perhaps i should urge caution ||| 1
i really enjoy this workout with the dvd i can do over the workout phase without having to rewind like with the vhs i originally wore out about 3 of her vhs workouts from rewinding and using again that makes it twice as much as you would just rewinding them once ||| 1

the master '' at acting like a conceited prat ! a master '' at complicating a simple situation with snotty santimonious drivel while making fun of people who he deems are intellectually inferior to his royal self by twisting their ideas and words around to suit his assault on them he seems somewhat taken with alan price who was there to ' or maybe alan had nothing else better to do because he had just been fired from the animals price did get drunk and throw a glass out onto the street much to the annoyance of zimmerman he also opened a bottle of beer on a piano keyboard taking a chip out of the instrument showing total lack of respect for other people 's property i guess obnoxious prats stick together huh we see dylan take every opportunity to make fun of donovan and we also see dylan 's manager albert grossman trying to extort every last penny he can from british tv networks as he lies and plays them off one against the other in order to get himself and dylan a few extra pounds finally there are about 6 musical musical it is to laugh ! ! numbers from zimmy alone on stage with his guitar huffing'n'puffing into his harmonica and achieving little more musical sense out of his efforts than lou reed did on his metal machine music debacle yeah and do n't forget joan baez ! better still forget joan baez ! ! well worth a look ||| 1

i need to preface this review with the comment that i am not a john wayne fan however the searchers '' is often said to be the duke 's best movie and it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and if anything his real talents were underused in his career still the searchers '' is a classic and deserves to be better known the anniversary edition is a must for any collector the restored print for the dvd is excellent just what you want to watch john ford 's gorgeous monument valley location shots the extras '' disk is also excellent there are three good documentaries all of which were made with thought and genuine concern a change from all those afterthought '' dvd extras one documentary features interviews with martin scorsese and another some great shots of the film production camp in monument valley in the early before it was on the tourist trail the documentaries would be of interest to serious film students and even amateur sociologists they illustrate the many serious social issues the searchers '' deals with and takes a serious and humane point of view on without preaching a lesson i suppose for today 's socially concerned '' film makers they really need to focus on the film making and the story first john ford did and the message is powerful and still relevant today ||| 1

what 's not to like about richard farnsworth he was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days an extremely likable old man '' hey few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old since he spent his younger days as a stuntman rather than as an actor so he was a very good choice to portray a likable thief bill miner the last of the stagecoach and train robbers the gentleman bandit '' i believe was his label this is a nice adventure with almost no bad language and the british columbia and washington state scenery is absolutely gorgeous it would look great on widescreen dvd what 's the holdup pun intended the only bad news of this tale is the usual filmmakers ' twisted message to root for a man who simply was a crook nothing else the film also especially to get the younger audience needs more action it will be too slow for them but i liked it if for no other reason that i can listen to farnsworth 's voice all night what a cool '' guy he was and it '' s always a pleasure to see him on screen ||| 1

few days ago i watched the documentary z channel a magnificent obsession '' 2004 about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100 000 lucky subscribers in la in while enjoying the clips from many foreign and independent movies that were the best part of documentary i was able to recognize the movie that i saw many years ago in moscow and still remember well i could not only recall the title i remember that the movie was dutch very erotic in the raw brutal twisted yet beautiful and passionate way watching z channel '' i was happy to instantly recognize turks fruit '' 1973 aka turkish delight '' made by paul verhoeven in 1973. i checked with netflix the movie was available i bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it my memory served me well verhoeven 's early film is as naturalistic earthy brutal erotic humorous poetic poignant and captivating as i remember it based on the novel by jan wolker turkish delight '' stars young hot very sexy and i mean it very sexy rutger hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor eric and even younger monique van de van as his wife olga yet as sensual as eric was the light of his life the fire of his loins '' the film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful holland 's film that was nominated for an academy award for best foreign language film and was proclaimed by jan wolker a 75 masterpiece '' there are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as verhoeven of his dutch period especially verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work fiery temperament and aggressive joe ezsterhaus who worked with verhoeven on two films said about him the guy is like his movies brilliant mercurial very daring perverse a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions '' the turkish delight '' is all that and i love it but i can understand how its graphic sexuality more than one disgusting and revolting scenes but they had to be in the movie and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers be prepared turkish delight '' is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch ||| 1
if there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people this would be it ! o'hara beautifully played by mia farrow does n't trust edwina the new beauty that 's come to town the two battle it out with edwina coming out the loser in the end or does she if i said any more i 'd be spoiling the story just watch this movie and enjoy things are never what they seem and i promise the ending will be worth staying for ||| 1

ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks it seems to have all the usual bits knight on a mysterious quest lovable thief and a loving couple under a vicious curse even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film due largely to the outstanding cast rutger hauer the knight of course michelle pfeiffer the other half of the cursed couple matthew broderick knave with a heart of gold and leo kern aging hermit in on the terrible secret saying much more would mean saying too much but it has the fairy tale ending you 'd hope for and expect good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs one thing about this movie or maybe the dvd transfer truly annoys me however someone messed with the colors like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters and has n't learned how garish they can be to whoever did it please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time outside of that it 's a safe entertaining movie enjoy ! wiredweir ||| 1
i first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend 's house and have loved isabeau and navarre ever since this movie has it all comedy drama and one amazing love story who 's heart did n't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise navarre 's devotion was utterly breathtaking a wonderful wonderful film ||| 1
since i was a child i have patiently anticipated the battle of evil versus evil it was discussed in school yards and in the lunch room at slumber parties and later when i started working as a clerk in a grocery store it was a never ending who would win in the battle of freddy and jason in my youth children spoke of some underground video tape that contained a battle between the two monsters but i do n't think that it ever existed and if it did i have never laid my eyes on such a relic but finally the horror movie to end all was released onto the big screen and later on to dvd it was everything i hoped for there was blood brief nudity and really bad jokes that is the unholy trinity of horror the plot was n't horrible it was actually pretty good for a fright flick freddy has n't graced the silver screen since 1994 when wes craven presented new nightmare '' and he kept his integrity intact in my opinion jason vorhees on the other hand made the space film jason x '' as his last trip to the theatres and if you have n't seen it yet do n't bother you did n't miss much i liked how the movie gave a back story to jason 's life at crystal lake and it showed that krueger is conniving and manipulative with getting jason to go along with his plan to kill on elm street once again obviously jason is a big dumb animal and does not need much convincing the cinematography and directing were excellent i thought the music was done well and most importantly the film stayed true to the original story line the only thing that upset me was after all these years waiting for this battle to come i was wrong about who would be victorious ||| 1
jason x as in friday the part 10 sheds light on a familiar though not too friendly face that of jason a miracle of science '' jason is to be transported from a facility to a research lab the transfer goes awry and he 's once again up to no good before being cryogenically suspended things become a bit complicated when in the year 2455 a spaceship arrives from earth ii ! and revives the masked lunatic the plot the setting the acting and the dialogues are all very good it 's just too bad the cutest girl gets whacked first in a nutshell jason x is a movie definitely worth watching as it will provide for an evening 's entertainment as long as you 're in that kind of a mood ||| 1

john lennon and his wife yoko ono were guests on the dick cavett show three times in 1971. their first apearance was taped on saturday september 11 1971 and was john 's first interview after the beatles had disbanded the subsequent interviews were taped on friday september 24 1971 and thursday may 11 1972. viewers beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among dick cavett and his guests john appeared to be in his element happily chatting with the famous talk show host it was a good thing john rightfully defends yoko during this interview and makes it quite plain that she did not break up the beatles she has been wrongfully blamed for something that was bound to happen naturally after all the individuals who made up the beatles needed to move individually grow develop their own individual styles the group could not last forever cavett gives john and yoko equal time he listens to them attentively takes them seriously and at no time criticizes anybody or speculates about anybody it is very easy to forget the interviews are taking place before a studio audience as viewers are easily lulled into the flow of the conversation yoko is very animated during this first interview she smokes chats easily with her host about her undergraduate days at sarah lawrence and shows a film she made john and cavett are actually funny sharing some humorous observations about clothing and coiffure be sure to get this dvd collection it is funny interesting serious thought provoking and memorable this is something for everybody and not just beatle fans yokophiles and lennonophiles the bonus dvd will certainly bring many smiles to many faces ||| 1
boy did this movie suck at the beginning ! and boy did it just get better and better from there on in even the oriental humor which is usually so awful was actually funny at times the action sequences while a little too often fanciful were very impressive even innovative chow is a talented guy having seen this i 'm interested to see what his earlier work is like if you like martial comedy you 'll love this ||| 1
certainly the best movie i 've ever seen kung fu hustle is loaded with effects and humor and stunning fight sequences to boot try and watch any regular martial arts movie afterward and all you can do is yawn even the great bruce lee is tired and in comparison to kung fu hustle the movie continues to top itself throughout with an escalation of fight scenes that peaks with the hero jumping higher than the clouds seeing buddha lightly stepping off a bird and plunging to earth to deliver a blow capable of knocking a hole in a building ! this aint just it 's with hilarious weirdness ||| 1
i know what you 're thinking if you 're anything at all like me when this movie was in the movie theaters and the previews were running rampantly i thought this looked like the stupidest piece of trash to ever grace the big screen but i 'll admit readily when i 'm wrong and here i absolutely was i 'm not saying little nicky is the world 's greatest film or even comedy but if you like adam sandler and silly comedies in general this is a movie that wo n't disappoint when you desperately need something mindless to turn your brain into mush after a horrendous week or even day at work a movie that opens with jon lovitz acting like a big horny bird in a tree certainly promises to be very entertaining and it is and we 're taken straight to hell with harvey keitel playing the devil himself very nicely a brief encounter with dan marino and the late rodney dangerfield to name a few we 're also treated to the heavens above with reese witherspoon and the guy who played adam sandler 's golf mentor in happy gilmore this movie has everything it takes to be insanely silly and entertaining and you 'll love what happens to hitler in this do n't take it too seriously if you do you miss the entire point of little nicky if this is your kind of movie add it to your collection you 'll watch it many many many times again enjoy ||| 1
it is the best movie i have ever seen it was so funny adam sandler is the best actor in the world which makes it even better i saw it at my friend 's house i would watch it again but i do n't have it little kids under 6 should not see this movie you will defiantly like this movie that is why you should buy this movie jason m ||| 1

annie hall '' is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time the film not only holds a place on the american film institute 's top 100 31 as well as the american film institute 's top 100 comedies 4 the film took home 4 academy awards including best picture and best director the film is also without a doubt one of the best ever made it really nails that awkwardness of romance i think few of us are like the neurotic woody allen and i do n't so much mean the way the characters act but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic woody allen plays alvy singer a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but ca n't really get a grip on love he 's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic which turns people off then his friend rob tony roberts introduces him to annie hall the wonderful diane keaton annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as alvy but the two click and begin a relationship that to say the least has it 's share of ups and downs now not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything but this film is also absolutely hilarious when i see a movie on afi 's top 100 comedies i tend to shy away from the films on that list not because they 're not good it 's just that they do n't really pick by what 's the funniest film ever example 'the 40 year old virgin ' was funnier than their number 1 pick some like it hot but anyway annie hall actually is very funny the dialogue is some the scenes have become classics allen sneezing on the cocaine in an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres it 's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is this is a great film a great a woody allen masterpiece grade a ||| 1

unfairly overlooked in the early 90 's for rideing at the tale end of the last wave of 80 's slasher films 'popcorn 1991 ' is a damn good little slasher flick with a somewhat dry but exceptable endind some decent acting a ludicrous story some good dark atmosphere decent kills plenty of cheese a pretty creepy villain the parody of a slasher film being set in a movie theatre is excellent wes craven the makers of 'scream ' owe alot to this little known gem for slurping up some inspiration ||| 1
what more can you ask for lou monte doing luna luna luna it 's here pope is vincent patrick 's best written work and his screenplay works with rourke and roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles the inside buzz is michael cimino sat in the directors chair but evidence to the contrary is offered the film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors instead pope is a raucous and likeable tale of nyc bottom feeders whose only place in trump tower would be behind a broom geraldine page gives an oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her best actress win for trip to bountiful she 's more enjoyable here ||| 1

i would n't write yet another review of war and peace if i did n't have something new to say about it namely war and peace and war by peter turchin near the end of turchin 's book about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires he quotes extensively from the parts of tolstoy 's war and peace tolstoy with his ratio analysis of various napoleon grand arme metrics to russian army metrics was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time pick up turchin 's deep book and afterwards read war and peace paying particular attention to turchin 's and tolstoy 's ideas you will never see historical dynamics the same again sincerely alex alaniz ps read the book the movie is n't so good and please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book beyond future shock about the perils and promise of advanced technology in a world still roiled with middle age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients ||| 1

i 've been a christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of rutherford 's handling of the character i loved joan hickson 's portrayal of miss marple and never thought anyone else could be '' miss marple for me therefore i expected to be disappointed with these new releases i am not disappointed i love this new version ! after i cautiously viewed the first episode i came to fully appreciate geraldine mcewan in the role she is subtle confident and highly adroit and i find her refreshing and wonderful the stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing some reviewers complained that the scripts do n't stick to the originals but this is not an issue for me here christie 's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they are n't always done the same way any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times i think it 's fun to be surprised by my old favorites ! hooray for geraldine mcewan ! i hope to see many more miss marple stories with her in the title role ||| 1
released during the just say no '' this film is a cautionary tale of drug abuse lenny is a guy just trying to stake his claim in the world to make a little money he soon impresses a big wheel who moves lenny and his wife to california where they are at first overwhelmed by the opulence but then become willing participants in it lenny continues to buy buy buy until it all crashes down when the money stops rolling in he is introduced to cocaine and the story then takes a dramatic turn as we watch lenny lose it all james woods is fabulous as lenny i 've seen this movie many times and now that i 'm writing about it i think it 's time to pop this one into the vcr for another viewing ||| 1
quite a bit of what i see on the few tv channels i let my kids watch depicts either behavior or is so vacuous i can not stand it this series has a plot good writing and good production values it has the added benefit that i can also stand to watch it i am hoping the second season maintains the quality of the first ||| 1
i 'm the biggest wuthering heights '' fan i know ask anyone who knows me and they 'll tell you i borderline annoying with the subject having money left over from my birthday i decided hey why not buy yet another wuthering heights dvd '' i was a little skeptical about how it would be seeing as all the adaptations i 've seen thus far have n't really taken the whole story into account of course to do so would be a hard task for a movie the story is complex and not a very sort of plot i was disappointed in the 1992 version with juliette binoche and ralph fiennes although it 's a good enough movie as long as it did n't have emily bronte 's wuthering heights as the title other versions were all right and although the 1939 version did n't showcase the second generation of the story i found it better than needless to say when i popped in the dvd i was hooked by the first five minutes sure the movie is n't exactly like the story i want you to show me a movie that is and as i said this story is complex for the movies some of the things that are are the fact that once again as in many of the movie adaptations nelly is old from the start also heathcliff and cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place such as when they visit the lintons most wuthering heights '' fanatics know that heathcliff and cathy never consemate their relationship however there 's many a kiss in the movie there are some other details of the movie that are different than the story but i a crazy wuthering heights '' and bronte admirer give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan ||| 1
it would n't surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie it 's rife for debate gary cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end we know he 'd never do it again sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because i have to '' and all that but only a fool would think that a place like hadleyville deserves protection can you imagine clint eastwood in cooper 's shoes at least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with hadleyville and its cowardly citizens but has everything to do with cooper and his code of honor is n't this the same gary cooper who played frederic henry in a farewell to arms based on hemingway 's novel a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and courage under fire '' a character who says in the novel that abstract words such as glory honor and courage were obscene '' how could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day never mind looking his wife in the eye again if he 'd skadaddled this existential hero had a choice to make a one and for him it meant only one thing it 's that kind of movie meaty and meaningful the experiment is interesting in these days of tv shows like 24 '' and the witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering too and let 's not forget the music either but basically it comes down to cooper reaching out and finding nobody there and then doing what he has to do anyway it 's a timeless idea and the movie is a classic ||| 1

i have to agree completely with the reviewer '' i read his review of play it again sam '' the scene where woody allen tries to be cool and composed when introduced to a lady and he instead of sounding anything like english only growls i recently found out about this movie because all i could think was of that scene that i did n't know where it came from i have to repeat that '' is right on the money that was the best comical scene ever ||| 1
based on the hyper known last farewell of bogart and bergman in casablanca will emerge a fabulous extraordinary and funny script that will allow allen to lean on bogart spirit to guide him about his personal hesitations and tribulations around the bride of his best friend surrealist and inventive tantalizing and evocative that counts with an excellent cast do not miss it for any reason ||| 1

the age of the hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the century then with the change of modern society in the 1960 's the western genre lost its allure and hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare thanks to ted turner and his love for american western film making the long lost western has been reborn in a big way tom selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of john wayne selleck is more than adequate for the part big in body and big in acting skill he takes the part of paul cable and turns his character into someone we can believe like and respect cable comes back from the civil war months before its official end he is tired of war and killing and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of arizona in trying to escape his wartime experiences cable runs into more trouble at home he finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning confederate soldier cable must not only fight to regain his farm but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage the story by elmore leonard is a solid one and very believable there are no dull or boring scenes the picture grabs you and holds you throughout selleck is terrific as paul cable fighting for his family his woman and his life selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of john wayne he is every man 's western hero selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease he is supported with a fine ensemble cast including suzy amis as his embittered gritty wife and haley joel osment of the sixth sense '' fame in a minor role as selleck 's son amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt amis ' portrayal as cable breaks the mould we see her with dirt and dust on her face with sweat dripping in lines across her face and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands or for that matter a rifle i personally welcome this portrayal of western women as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her petticoats david and keith cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm harry carey plays a small role as selleck 's as a collector of fine western films i intend to keep last stand at saber river '' as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great hollywood westerns it 's not an epic but it is fine and will please those craving for a fine western drama i recommend it james konedog '' koeni ||| 1
this movie i consider to be akin to 'vertigo ' by alfred hitchcock the pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of action pulling the story along it also mimics 'rear window ' in that the main character witnesses a murder in this case though he was set up to be the witness depalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire he slams the porn industry in some very funny ways you will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes what i liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end i do n't want to give away too much here but a clever use of 'hollywood hijinks ' and the line 'do n't believe everything you see ' fit with the story very well 'postcards from the edge ' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be in this film depalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be as in 'dressed to kill ' depalma relies on acting to carry the story and quite successfully too the scene begins when craig wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he 's been watching though a telescope the scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach i believe it 's about 20 minutes played out well with body language and facial expressions this scene could n't work any other way like 'vertigo ' this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat maybe too much detail not sure i found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to many movies attempt this slower approach or do it in a way that makes it work all in all definitely a must see keep in mind the action is a bit slow at times melanie griffith appears here and does a great job in her role as do the other actors filming camera angels and use of props all work well the plot is complex this is a must see for mystery fans ||| 1
though cancelled for 2 years this is the best show on tv in my opinion even in reruns ||| 1
we have all heard about placement ' especially in the james bond films did you know it goes all the way back to no and was very prominent in the scene where bond kicks and tosses quarrel and puss feller into a stack of corrugated cartons notice that those cartons are labeled stripe ' that 's right stripe ' beer from jamaica ! in this case placement ' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film in fact no is one of the best films of the series it is much closer to ian fleming 's prose than most of the other films thanks to sean connery 's performance richard maibaum 's scripting and terence young 's direction at the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here production designer ken adam 's sets attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional adorned by syd cain 's detailed art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in no the benchmark peter hunt 's intuitive and effective editing paced the film like no other at its time maurice binder 's brainchild opening barrel ' is an incredible piece of title design which is equaled only by the bond theme ' composed and by monty norman and john barry ted moore 's cinematography especially the shot of bikini clad ursula andress emerging from the sea is now a classic and also set a standard for future girls ' we are introduced to the organization known as in no what is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by joseph wiseman he is unlike future main villains of the series he is n't exactly what you may call a animal ' joseph wiseman 's eerie and surreptitious portrayal made no one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series in a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen blofeld in from russia with love and thunderball rounded out by the beloved m portrayed by bernard lee the lovely miss moneypenny played by lois maxwell john kitzmiller as quarrel and zena marshall as miss taro no ranks as one of the best ||| 1
this movie was more than i expected i was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects and especially the robots you are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end i did not expect it to be who it was the reason why i rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from smith i was not prepared for it especially since the movie is not rated for language other than that i highly recommend this movie ||| 1
kelly 's heroes '' is an odd yet quite enjoyable war movie this 1970 's comedic cinematic take on wwii mixes genres such as the suicide film the film and the army comedy in other words take a lot of the dirty dozen '' mix a bit of ocean 's 11 '' and add in some '' plus '' and you 'll have kelly 's heroes '' the film features a battered army infantry unit which has been on the front lines since landing at omaha beach all they have on there minds is a little r r that includes booze broads that is until pvt kelly clint eastwood interrogates with a bottle of brandy a captured german intelligence officer who tells him about a nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small french bank that is being vigorously guarded by three nazi 'tiger ' tanks i know in this day and age it might sound rather odd but this is one war movie that is not only suspenseful but is also a whole lot of fun ! is it an accurate portrayle of wwii probably not i doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the big one '' this 1970 release pretty much through its ' hilarious sharp script has more of a vietnam era mentality which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it 's attitudes about war unlike the john wayne style war films of the past these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes but they are just trying to make it through the war with their 's intact and maby make a little profit on the side the film features a large talented cast some of whom were already stars and others who later went on to become big names in both television and film this includes clint eastwood telly savalas donald sutherland don rickles caroll o'connor gavin macleod stuart margolin harry dean stanton and len lesser uncle leo from tv 's seinfeld '' how can you go wrong with a cast like that if your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs mixed in then i would highly recommend kelly 's heroes '' ||| 1
its hard to imagine that a war film can leave you with a big smile at the conclusion but here is one that will ! with non stop action drama and comedy kellys heroes has it all with a top notch cast and soundtrack to boot the original script of a bank heist behind enemy lines during is a classic and is brilliantly executed at all levels even though the film is based on a fictional plot it still has an authentic feel and is rated an all time classic highly recommended ||| 1
all monty python movies are a i think my generation has seen them all i hope the younger generation less than 40 watch at least one the humor is at many levels so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in this just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing like all good humor it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general as well as politics and religion without getting nasty ||| 1

this dvd is the best one ive ever seen snoop put out the concert footage and sound isnt the greatest but this dvd is so much more that i thought i was getting dont get me wrong the concert parts are so dope to hear my fav snoop classics and i was left with one question how did they get clearance from suge to put out his death row classics but this dvd shines as a replayable classic you would be so so suprised at what is on this see most people are happy getting a concert dvd like the up and smoke where snoop performs in one city you watch it after fast forwarding through all the opening acts like westside connec and you dont have to watch it again for years this is quite a different approach i was literally hurting from laughing so hard because this dvd gives you the bishop don juan it gives you backstage it gives you the norml conference you cant even take it all in if you watched it once ! i say if you like snoop if you like weed if you like biatches and hiznoes you got a winner with the puff puff pass ||| 1
most of this movie is terrible but who 's complaining the epically long begin the beguine '' is the climax of the movie it makes the whole mess worthwhile the last 11 minutes of this movie are great absolute perfection the sets the cinematography the costumes the orchestrations the extraordinary routine itself everything combines to make begin the beguine '' the most ravishing glamorous black white production number ever put on film it 's hollywood at its apogee the quintessence of silver screen glamor a few of the other numbers are fun the first do n't monkey with broadway '' is clever pleasant later on fred astaire 's lovely i 've got my eyes on you '' is also winning a charming routine that he dances to a delightful cheerful orchestration some other numbers are worth seeing as well but begin the beguine '' outshines everything else in this picture in between the numbers there 's a lot of dreary silliness afoot happily dvd technology makes it easy to skip over the dross go straight for the gold eleanor powell was a very odd actress she was rather pretty decidedly perky how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality she was also quite feminine why then does she speak out of the side of her mouth like a gangster she often sounds like a distaff edward robinson dat was swell johnny swell ! nyah ! '' but man oh man could she dance ! ||| 1
right after watching this my wife and i called our now 14 yo dancer in to see it she in turn had her dance buddies watch it the next time they were over the look of amazement on all of our faces as we watched some of the best there ever was worth the price of admission like the commercial says dvd player 200 dvd 15 watching your daughter work ten times harder on her ||| 1
oh wow i ca n't complain much about this although some things i did n't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed this was still very effective on me it may 've been better as a game or not i do n't know there were several times where this made me so emotional i wanted to cry for the characters the silent and melancholy kaze the hilarious and deranged cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins even for the short time you know them they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching i know some people may not be satisfied with this but i was i recommend it ||| 1
all time classic story no matter your economic circumstances with the right help anyone can succeed just do n't forget the people you left behind ! ||| 1
i had often heard about degrassi the next generation i went on to the show 's website often even though i did n't get the channel it shows on i knew as much about the show that everyone else did and i did n't even see the show so after a year or two of trying to figure out how to i could see the show i heard that they were making a dvd and i was so excited ! i ordered it on ebay a few months after it came out and it was fairly priced i watched all of it in a day and i was ecstatic this show is all about what it is really like being a teen nothing fake but not giving life lessons on everything like internet relationships the effects of using ecstasy presssure beer family rumors first dates and all sorts of things season one is especially perfect for prettens and early teenagers because it is based around a group of and graders of course through the seasons the characters face changes and more dramatic situations but somehow there is always a season for teens and preteens of every age to relate to and that 's what everybody likes about the show this dvd also includes auditions for most cast members which are fun to watch bloopers and deleted scenes which add more to the episode and a karaoke of the theme song which is also very fun with cast and characters biographies you can tell that the creators of the dvds put as much into them as possible and it pays off ||| 1
ronald reagan might have gotten the nickname of the gipper '' from this 1940 of legendary notre dame football coach knute rockne but it was veteran character actor pat o'brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead james cagney had lobbied hard for the role but when the actor signed a petition supporting the republican and government in the spanish civil war notre dame refused to okay him for the part this was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in south bend and if you do know that the other one was rudy '' you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one knute rockne all american '' which was added to the national film registry in 1997 is a fairly standard evincing the almost documentary style that was standard at the time we see how the young rockne played by johnny sheffield boy in the johnny weissmuller tarzan movies learned to love football revolutionized the game with the forward pass and coached his alma mater to glory with the four horsemen and george gipp the result is a long series of episodes from rockne 's life that have varying degrees of appeal such as when he picks up the idea for his backfield shift from watching chorus girls dance and experiments with the idea using his wife and their dinner guests lots of footage of actual notre dame games are worked into the film although i have no way of knowing if any of it is of the actual games being portrayed i would be curious to know o'brien 's performance seems a tad wooden but if you have ever seen actual film clips of rockne you know he is in the ballpark a lot of the charm of this film comes from the ethos of the original rockne an american legend who was probably the first famous victim of an airplane crash the result is not great but certainly compelling plus we all learn the correct pronunciation of his name as being reagan 's supporting role is deservedly memorable that same year he would get to play third banana george armstrong custer to errol flynn and olivia dehavilland in the santa fe trail '' and would provide his best performance in king 's row '' before military service in world war ii effectively derailed his acting momentum and ultimately set his life on a different path final note while there is little doubt that rockne invented the forward pass there is debate over one aspect of this film in his first scene as george gipp reagan is sitting around doing nothing when rockne orders him to go in at halfback to play against the varsity and run the ball gipp asks how far '' and proceeds to run it back all the way after crossing the goal line he bounces the ball off the endzone instead of laying it down for the touchdown '' an argument has been made that this was the first spike in the history of football at least it is the first recorded '' spike did the current tradition of choreographed celebrations all stem from what ronald reagan did in this 1940 film you decide if that is yet another part of the reagan legacy that is being reconsidered this week ||| 1

a for all kate rusby fans this concert video is a pure winner showcasing rusby and her band at their best before an adoring appreciative english audience several things are worth pointing out first what a delight to see how friendly and she is and what a fine performer authoritative yet not stuffy or standoffish in any way she presents these old trad ballads in a way that makes them seem like the most immediate and compelling of contemporary art and of course the music is simply stunning the band plays sweet but keeps things simple it 's warm and modern without muddling down in crossover pretensions it 's just simply lovely lovely acoustic music finally there 's the experience of seeing rusby sing is it possible such a perfect sound is coming out of that lass before you guess so now i 'll have to redouble my efforts to see her when she plays live at a venue near me i know it 'll be a night to remember ||| 1

known to all this is the story of dorothy gale and her journey to the magical land of oz she meets a scarecrow who needs a brain a tin man who wants a heart and a cowardly lion who desperately needs courage the most popular film of all time seen by over a billion people it 's timelessness is proof enough of its value certainly flawed when scrutinized and written about for 56 years but still most beloved in 1998 rereleased on the big screen magic and admittedly the most important film of my life as a child i was obsessed with the film and only a little less now ||| 1
the movie with the or guarantee ! crank your engines ! with a roar sputter and pop drivers wheel westward in wacky century autos for a new race ahead 20.000 miles a barroom brawl a sinking iceberg 2.357 pies in the face and incalculable laughts blake edwards turns a marvelous cast loose on a higway by some of the funniest screen gags ever jack lemmon and peter falk are nasty professor fate and his dim henchman max tony curtis is their nemsis the great leslie and nathalie wood is suffragatte reporter maggie dubois zestily scored by henry mancini and ravishing in a new digital transfer with revitalized digital audio from restored elements the great race is great fun ! as i mention super transfer and recommended highly ! ||| 1
lemon and curtis are a great team some like it hot '' and the great race '' in this movie we have great melodrama and the ageless story of boy meets girl natalie wood and she catches him the cast is enhanced by the superb acting of peter falk in one of his great comic roles the hapless maximillian always catching the short end of the stick by his perpetually boss the permanently crabby professor fate lemon curtis does what he does best looks dashing and debonoir in a role so familiar to him he could phone it in this dvd is a collector and one of my top ten favorites ||| 1
waiting was a pleasant surprise it 's certainly filled with crude humor but it manages to be funny anyhow my first job was in a restaurant much like shenaniganz and perhaps that 's why i found the movie so worth watching the game the employees play is over the top but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on if you 're a rude anus of a customer do n't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks wo n't mess with your food they will it pays to be polite and tip well especially if you are a regular chi mcbride 's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great and i thought luis guzman did a great job as raddimus all in all based on personal experience the movie was n't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical golden corral or ryan 's steak house sure the characters are over the top but they are based on people just like some i 've known if you 're offended by frontal male and female nudity or crass sex jokes you wo n't want to see this movie ||| 1
this film burns the screen with power sensitivity unbreakable bonds and emotional connections that will blow your mind jolie and burress shine in foxfire in a way that you 'll never forget every woman has been a girl and even if they store their feelings deep inside they have to wish they had spent a few months like these girls i know i do but even guys have to relate to the realistic rebellious and connected spirit these girls reflect every character is i wish i could change the ending of the movie but that ending is what keeps things real this movie is definitely a treasure ||| 1
foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world the inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the girl that brings the 4 others together legs played phenomenally by angelina jolie i must say this i really do n't care much for jolie and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her billy bob and their whole blood thing the top news story more recently her with brad pitt but i cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance if you are like me and do n't like her please do give her a chance in this film she 's astonishingly good and i kept having to remind myself it was angelina as a matter of fact the entire cast turns in memorable performances i think this is a great movie for women to watch but i do n't know if men will enjoy it quite as much i did see one male reviewer claiming he did n't find it to be just a chick flick but he might be the minority guy or gal if the story sounds intriguing to you and it really is then foxfire is definitely worth checking out i give it only 4 stars simply because the character of maddy wonderfully played by hedy burress has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with but that 's my only criticism at this price it 's a fabulous addition to your collection though believe it or not the low price right here on amazon has been beaten by it 's in the 5.50 bin this is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe definitely recommended ||| 1
probably the best place to start for bergman initiates three decent films although i think through a glass '' is in a different class to the other two features moreover they all form a useful overview of the progression of bergman 's art from circa 1960 to circa from the religious torment of 1961 's winter light '' through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of through a glass '' to the explicit focus on familial relationships of the silence '' the latter reminiscent of bergman 's 60 's output in short although there is nothing to match the astounding persona '' 1966 the films do give a great indication as to bergman 's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in euroean art house cinema of the early in general dvd excellent criterion transfers the documentary disc a swedish film about the production of winter light '' is excellent as well worth watching alone for bergman 's casual conversations on his religious torment he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread ||| 1

soldier of orange with commentary by director paul verhoeven is a for all history buffs wwii historians and lovers of war movies based on the life of erik haselhoff roelfzema it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of a small group of law students in leiden the netherlands verhoeven 's commentary is worth the price of the dvd as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray while asking some very thought provoking questions verhoeven and i are the same age and both of us lived in holland during the occupation his view of the conditions in holland and the responses of the dutch under occupation are very different i also think his references to das england spiel are inaccurate having said all that i still consider the dvd one of my most favorite productions including the film itself soldaat van oranje is my choice for best ever dutch film those interested in learning more about the real eric hazelhoff roelfzema should read soldaat van oranje omnibus '' which includes de verre tamboer the distant drummer '' and op jacht naar het leven in pursuit of life '' all by eric hazelhoff roelfzema ||| 1
yet another amazing film from paul verhoeven with so much depth and weight i ca n't even tell you stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do jeroen krabbe gives an excellent performance as does rutger hauer in the leading role everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films so many great scenes alex and eric 's tango towards the end april fools day '' vengeance on a bicycle the beach scene and many many more see this as soon as possible it would make a terrific double feature with the young lions ||| 1

in my opinion there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of martin short 's humor with the exception of clifford '' my then teen children and i spilt our sides laughing at short 's work when we first saw this film ! several times we laughed so hard at a scene we could n't go on until we replayed the scene several times over we were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter ! all three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored even if you are not a big fan of martin short you will enjoy clifford '' ||| 1

regarding the above title there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the dvd there seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the usa and the uk as they do very little to the film 's context still it 's a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore if that 's what you 're into and i 'd still give it a 9 out of 10 ||| 1

i can not recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie which is my favourite from the 1980 's by far the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in big business '' that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood 's golden age a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely does n't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in big business '' it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york 's business world the story begins in a flash back when wealthy new yorkers hunt and binky shelton are passing through rural backwater jupitor hollow when binky goes into labour at the same time locals garth and iona ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of sadie and rose but are also mixed up we move forward forty years to where sadie shelton is the corporate head of moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of holomade the local industry in jupitor hollow getting wind of their plans the militant jupitor hollow resident rose ratliff decides to go fight these pinstriped trouser snakes '' on their own territory and sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring jupitor hollow through a mix up they end up staying in the plaza hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as sinks in the living room '' and soaps in the shapes of swans '' ! complication piles on top of complication as sadie shelton 's ex husband michael barry primus ca n't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural sadie for his hard nosed wife and jay marshall michael gross ca n't for the life of him understand why rose ratliff is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure rose shelton all comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two sadie 's are really the city sheltons while the two rose 's are really the twins meant to be in jupitor hollow the fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when sadie shelton is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to sadie ratliff to put all her watching of her idol alexis carrington in dynasty '' to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing jupitor hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins on the classic 1960 's comedy series the patty duke show '' i dont think i 've ever seen bette midler in finer form than in big business '' her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails sadie shelton who 's all hostile takeovers '' to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin sadie ratliff who only wants to be able to say keep the change ! '' is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter her classic mirror sequence with her twin '' is a total riot and her statement that this whole thing has got ufo written all over it ! will have you breaking up with laughter equally lily tomlin as both country activist rose ratcliff i 'm gon na go kick some snooty new york ass ! and as rose shelton the awkward out of place city girl i hate shopping and i hate new york in june ! is also top rate her rejection of jay 's engagement ring as a supposed bribe '' and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a great big belly scraping pile of cow plop ! is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene i never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening i have of this movie of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at new york 's plaza hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk 's joe grifasi continual mixing up of sadie which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined and especially fabio alberici 's michele placido total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with one minute they are corporate killers the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone ! the hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women one from the country and the other from the city seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff it is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both bette midler and lily tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first classics like im gon na dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease ! '' oh my god it 's so cosmopolitan '' oh sure its full of crowds smog sex fiends and white slavers it 's a pistol i 've got about as much use for it new york as a toad has for spit pearls ! computer chips they 've got their ways ! and have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more it is a real pity that big business '' so far has marked the only time that bette midler and lily tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle this film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages i 've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as i am ! so i 'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you have n't already you wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends in bette midler and lily tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in big business '' enjoy ! ||| 1
while elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video that is not the only good thing about this one it features several shorts with cartoons and different characters my favorite part of the video and my daughter 's is the part featuring ernie and bert ernie decides he is going to be a doctor and needs bert 's help so he can practice doing the things doctors do bert just wants to know if he is healthy and after putting him through several tests ernie says that he does n't know if bert is healthy or not because he is n't a he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not ! the cartoons are funny and there is a never before seen elmo 's world at the end all about doctors too very cute ||| 1

an exercise in but done so well it 's forgivable set in london circa 1910 chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill one day as he stumbles home drunk he smells gas and rescues a young girl claire bloom from a suicide attempt he nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past including a great sketch with buster keaton in which he plays the fiddle and keaton the piano it was both their swan songs the movie is autobiographical and reeks of with a number of references to chaplin 's carrer in pictures alluded to but there 's intelligence too and not a little sentimentality what chaplin picture does n't contain this but chaplin is such a demanding master that there is n't a moment of sloughing off or cheapness chaplin did everything from writing the script to composing the music and all of it is touched with genius made in 1952 the movie amazingly was not seen in hollywood until 1972 ||| 1
many shows have their moments but this is the first show i 've ever laughed out loud multiple times in one episode the humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed i will say that you do need to be around my age i 'm 40 to get alot of the inside jokes but if you do their hilarious and if you do n't there 's still plenty to make you laugh i would highly recommend all three volumes that are out now ||| 1
just as a note that 's the japanese title there 's something about this movie that i 've always liked i 'm not sure what it is but being a pokemon fan of course i like it the movie have always been great and this one has something that i really like about it the movie starts out in the north pole with a scientist named lund his friend yuko and his son tory there is suddenly an explosion and tory is trampled by a frightened pack of walrein and as they say after that all heck broke looks a meteor is the reason for the explosion and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average pokemon deoxys a rare pokemon from another planet woah more than one niiice the strange creature carrying a rock with a gem inside is suddenly attacked by the large rayquaza a frequenter of the ozone layer so what the heck is he here for ah so rayquaza feels threatened by deoxys and so both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle with some pretty cool background music might i add so professor lund flees with his colleages and son four years later a young pokemon trainer named ash ketchum along with some friends enter the high tech city of la rousse and as fate would have it tory 's hometown and well i wo n't spoil it from there the plot is good and deoxys ' 'destructive ' intentions are less cruel than one would think do n't worry folks no angsty here also rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie his fights against deoxys are totally awesome the soundtrack is also great i really love the music played during the opening scenes of the movie and the fights between rayquaza and deoxys the animation is very spiffy shiny bright and new SMILE i have n't had the pleasure of watching the original japanese version of the movie but when i do i 'll tell you all about it 'kay well i guess that pretty much wraps things up oh yes tory 's afraid of pokemon due to the whole 'get attacked by a herd of walrein ' thing heh okay then sayanora faithful readers ! ||| 1

wrath of the dragon introduction the dragon ball z series is one of the finest animes out there as any fan of japanese animation will tell you the series has a love it or hate it '' reputation but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons young people love the series for the action and adventure while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time it 's no wonder the series is considered akira toriyama 's magnum opus and by far the best of the three dragon ball series when toei animation made dragon ball into an anime they did n't copy toriyama 's mangas verbatim they added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace toei even created movies based on the series ! there were thirteen movies two television specials and one while not usually canon to the storyline they are an undeniable part of the dragon ball z franchise that ca n't be ignored overview this is the thirteenth of the thirteen dragon ball z movies the story majin buu is beaten our heroes have won peace has returned yeah right just as everyone has settled down gohan and videl rescue an old suicidal man and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the dragon balls what they do n't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe the z fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe but are they strong enough review of story this is one of my favorite dragon ball z movies due in no small part to the unique storyline and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular granted i wish vegeta had a larger role but no big complaints there there is no other part of the dragon ball z series that has a storyline anything like this the interaction between trunks and tapion is excellent as well and the ending let 's just say it stands on a plane all its own you wo n't want to miss it official this is a rare example of a dragon ball z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline right after the defeat of buu this would fit into the actual series continuity it did n't exist in the original manga so i consider it unofficial but you be the judge review of dvd all of funimation 's dragon ball z dvds are pretty much the same as far as content goes there is no bonus content unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the dvd to be bonus material and honestly i could have lived without them some more recent dvds have character profiles though these are lacking and could have been written better why could n't get get interviews with cast and crew or something like that funimation has a lot of room to improve on the dvds the dubbed version lots of people tend to bash funimation 's dub of the dragon ball z series why it 's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid they can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes such as full metal alchemist but every time they 've tried dubbing toriyama 's classic they butcher it to hell the nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series stick with the uncut subbed track overall get it dragon ball z movies do n't get any better than this edition notes it was released in edited and uncut versions do i even have to say it get uncut and watch the subtitled japanese version ||| 1

i thought this was an excellent excellent film i saw it for the first time last night and i was struck by how well it was acted and filmed it was directed by jean renoir so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation but it was exceptionally good in response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors i would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized the prison rooms looked like hotel rooms and the treatment of the prisoners however one should realize how different world war one was from world war two or other more recent wars wwi had a few decent reasons for being fought but primarily it was about european countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings as seen in this film and all quiet on the western front '' and the poetry of cummings many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches they fought for the ideals of their respective countries but separated from the propaganda your enemy could be your neighbor in wwii there was an obvious evil genocide to fight against that needed to be defeated but wwi had mostly stereotypes to lend menace grand illusion '' like the rules of the game '' reflects the decline of the great aristocratic families of europe that was occuring during and after wwi ancient families that had controled dynasties for centuries were left without the power they had held the world moved on and left them in anachronism a reality which von rauffenstein and boieldieu foresee much of the film is focused on the universality of the human condition it does n't deny the differences between people but it shows how the connections between people can transcend some of these barriers when faced with the reality of war ||| 1
this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame i love a good movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted ||| 0
if you are looking for a good movie to buy for your child pass on this one this movie has so many drug references i ca n't even begin to explain trust me i just so happen to have taken acid before this is a movie that never should have been directed toward children if you want your child to be drug free when grows up do not buy this ||| 0
fun to watch but my 9 old daughter could not follow the moves neither could i for that matter we tried to learn the moves through breaking it down '' but there is just not enough repetition too complicated ||| 0
every review i 've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and i just do n't get it no one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it and by then you 're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next if you like extremely broad slapstick humor and find that totally charming then i guess i can see the appeal everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases i have to wonder what they could be damned melon ! '' or i passed out when i broke my wrist and when i woke up the cast was already on ! '' i will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor because they say completely different things or omit speech altogether in sum do n't waste your time ||| 0
the acting was very good the pace was adequate however the plot was predictable the movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome clive 's character kept calling this the perfect robbery the characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters ca n't possibly know what is going on i 'm still not sure what jody foster 's character brings to the plot any way they do stupid things the bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet you do n't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie however they do call it a s thole during the movie they spent hours on this hole why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine they even brought buckets in with them they were disguised as painters why could n't clive 's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel furthermore the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag i have to be honest i did n't guess the ending i kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues for example a big one is the title of the movie however the lame clues the s thole acted like red herrings they threw me off the scent ||| 0
wedding crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself wo n't enjoy two womanizers fall in love one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin like first off what does virginity have to do with love second who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin then owen wilson 's character fall in love with rachel 's mcadams character and well that 's the usual predictable romance plot the problem with this film is it 's not that funny it seems to think it 's better then it is i do n't think i hardly laughed during this film the part about the supposive '' gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course because it 's this kind of film he ends up being gay and of course he tries to hit on vince vaughn 's character in a scene that is beyond creepy lets just say that gay '' guy is prob one of the worst actors i 've seen then we get a cameo from will ferrell alot of people i know find this guy so '' funny but i do n't get it it just was n't funny to me u know i loved the classic american pie '' that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy ! this film was n't so much funny as stupid for the most part i 'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it 's just an average film ||| 0
it 's amazing how hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to secession mythology from birth of a nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification this is a very dull shapeless stilted movie i would n't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds but since it is above all a piece of propaganda i 'm compelled to condemn it as history what it presents is the war between the states '' version of the civil war in which the gallant southerners defend their homes their beloved hills and dales their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the north there are only two black characters both sentimentally loyal to their southernness and their masters otherwise slavery is beside the point the generalship of lee and jackson of course is idolized while the northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools the battle scenes are perfectly predictable guys charge on foot other guys shoot the fields are littered with bodies would n't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting how real is it to show only one train and that southern in a war won more by transportation than by musketry if you are a believer in the myth of the lost cause and the justice of secession if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the war was n't really about slavery then i challenge you honor ! i defy you to read just one heavy scholarly book arguing about slavery by william lee miller a professor at the university of virginia it retells the debates that occurred in the house of representatives over slavery in the years before the election of lincoln the uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the civil war had deeper roots than you thought and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides blue and grey ||| 0
maybe for some people to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal but in matt sullivan 's case it could be a total nightmare after his girlfriend nicole leaves him matt spends about six months devouring girls until he starts to hallucinate advised by his brother matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems and proposes to go through lent without sex for matt 's friends this odyssey is as absurd as impossible and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last matt 's abstinence he does n't have it easy as many temptations will make him suffer and even smell the possibility of a new love 40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character in a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love oh what a shocking discovery ! ||| 0
great movie but cd not perfoming in the last few scenes it gets stuck or restarts itself very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new cd ||| 0

i 'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond there really was n't much here i liked the soundtrack was the usual pap '' you 'd expect from a family friendly movie though the sets were nice it seems this movie was just miscast mel just does n't do comedy all that well at least for a lead role jame garner the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character although the cast is a powerhouse on paper sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball an example there was a sequence when bret asks his friends who are standing behind him to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting which as it turns out they are unable to do instead jodie and james blow madly just like the movie this movie reminds me a hell of a lot like ''the three amigo 's '' on paper you would think it could n't miss but on film it 's painful to watch ||| 0
this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in 96 ' but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television note 's this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon and one of my most personal favorites mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she 's to good but why this film she and mila are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this ||| 0
i was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and ghibli studios previous works all the greater the disappointment then when less than half way through the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original several key characters are lumped together most confusingly and others lose all their complex charm what a shame if you have never read the book and are a fan of miyazaki by all means buy this you 're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him if you are a fan of the book steer well clear you 're likely to want to poke miyazaki with a stick and see if his head turns into a turnip or his turnip into a head ||| 0
along with the nanny the stepdad the cable guy the girl with a crush we now have the photo processing clerk to fear ! yes everyone is out to get or at least that 's what hollywood would have us believe i am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality no wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion mistrust fear and the resulting isolation when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us yes films like these have their place however i think hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality ||| 0
well i sure could have skipped this one i well remember the critics raving over this on television but why is beyond me mostly i was just plain bored there simply was no depth at all just bunches of short takes and wise cracks bush was just downright dirty making insults and slurs all over the place something i do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be president and it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that mary matalen the deputy manager of bush 's campaign and very maybe she wrote some of the slurs bush used is now the wife of james carville top strategist for clinton 's campaign and basically the star of the movie but all the scenes were focused on the funny quip the bon mot no long scenes of the work or any answers to any questions about clinton either for that matter ||| 0
so i bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing well anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing awesome good or ok has never actually seen salsa dancing ! ! i am a salsa dancer and this movie was horrible ! ! ! i have seen amazing dancing and good dancing this was terrible dancing ! and there was hardly any salsa ! it was dancing to salsa music ! that 's it the only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner other than that it was just dancing to salsa music that 's it if you want to see salsa dancing i definitely do not recommend this movie if you want to see horrible acting and old dancing then i recommend this movie there was only one thing that i liked about this movie the appearances made by tito puente and celia cruz that was great to see but not worth buying the movie for oh and the story line what was it again yeah i love movies good ones and bad ones but this one the worst movie i have seen so far to the best of my knowledge there are n't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing hopefully someday there will be ||| 0
from start to finish a total waste of time i viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman we were all appalled at how desparate this pamela '' was note to the director not all women waiting on god are that desparate the so called christian principals in this movie were laughable at the end of the movie i found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time ||| 0
this movie was so horrible i do n't know where to start maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street or maybe he just casted his own family at any rate they were untrained and stale secondly i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his plays why would n't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit if you 're trying to actually sale to a christian audience furthermore i thought the bible said a little something against divorce like it was n't permitted unless your spouse commits this movie seems to say it 's okay to go against the word of god if you 're in love in fact christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice even the protagonist ! i laugh as i think of the scene where peniston 's character says seductively i 'm looking for a man with his mind on jesus '' yet she 's dressed like a hooker speaking of clothing why did seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene they go on a date and she 's dressed one way by the time they come home she has on something different with no logical explanation and please explain why they had someone 's grandfather playing the role of rico suave maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman 's dream i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him in addition the soundtrack at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music i just wanted the maddness to stop ! lastly it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate although some are however having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just well almost juvenile perhaps even a disrespect to women at large overall this movie made me want to puke pastor larry flash '' jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity ||| 0
this has got to be one of the worst most unrealistic movies to date i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks rarely are they done well this one however takes it to a whole new level what was courtney love thinking ! you 'll regret wasting your money on this i ca n't even fathom why it 's gotten decent reviews so far ||| 0

cheap trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today they have such great stage charisma top notch talent and they consistently get better with age ! what other band sounds better 30 years later after my disappointment with the special one cd i was excited to hear about this dvd i heard most special one songs live and could n't understand why they translated to tape poorly having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out and the songs do sound much better now such tremendous intensity robin has live the guitars and bass sound great and there 's a great build up to the climax of each song however what 's really the downer about this dvd is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track you then get of each live song not a single song appears here in its entirety it 's like a behind the music without drama or drugs based around a new live show the banter is great but this format kills the replay value of this disc the closest comparison i can give is the version of silver how the second dvd has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs that 's exactly what this is like however you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show bonus features are fun with the band and their families visiting japan although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety perhaps someday we 'll get the budakan show on dvd or an updated every trick in the book dvd update exactly a year later i 've still yet to pop this into my dvd player for a second watch and cheap trick 's still my favorite band ||| 0
this dvd gives documentary coverage concerning such da vinci code topics as rosslyn chapel the priory of scion the knights templar the gnostic gospels le dossier secrets da vinci paintings and opus dei this dvd beyond the da vinci code seems to bend over backwards measuring every narrated word to try to support and be sympathetic towards the dan brown allegations made in his novel despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary they still seem to be in favor of what dan brown has written in the da vinci code out of a half dozen expert interviewees the most notable are two big '' names who are major influences on the da vinci code book margaret starbird author of the woman with the alabaster jar and richard leigh one of three authors of holy blood holy grail which was a ny times bestseller in 1982 both appear throughout this program these two are probably the biggest proponents of the conspiracy today after dan brown himself so it is especially meaningful when richard leigh and margaret starbird disagree with what dan brown has written ! according to expert interviewee richard leigh though the da vinci code book says that the knights templar found documents to prove the conspiracy in reality nobody knows what if anything was found by the knights templar in solomon 's temple leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram pentacles stars as mainly representing the sacred feminine '' is nonsense that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often ! richard leigh also explains that the original priory of scion was last referenced in 1619 but the modern day priory of scion people from the last 50 years are bonkers '' trying to present a hoax of the le dossier secrets to try to gain political influence for themselves this le dossier secrets which appears on the bogus fact '' page at the beginning of the da vinci code book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of jesus but has been debunked for decades in france it does not belong on a page titled fact '' in the da vinci code book ! that is very misleading not factual brown says the le dossier secrets were discovered but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney ! margaret starbird another major influence on the dan brown novel says that even though she believes in the bloodline there is no proof of the bloodline lasting into the french merovingian line of kings circa the first millenium the documentary using other expert interviewees and location footage goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the rose line alignments being found in significant locations throughout the da vinci code novel as well as showing there is no evidence that leonardo da vinci was a member of the priory of scion let alone the grandmaster the rose is not the symbol for the priory of scion and opus dei has no interest in the secret '' bloodline of because they do n't believe it even exists sadly most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show in brief statements before quickly moving on to the next topic while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what dan brown 's da vinci code book claims about the conspiracy overall i was disappointed by this history channel dvd for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ai n't so in the da vinci code book though i am not surprised the history channel usually sides against christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows in my opinion a much better da vinci code debunking dvd is breaking the da vinci code which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel 's lies about history and jesus ||| 0
i saw this at the library and brought it home thinking it might be interesting to watch i very rarely watch films made after the 1950 's but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable it ended up being only mildly enjoyable and a bit boring i felt that within all the time it ran we did n't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters seemed to remain in shallow waters all along the film was sort of good pretty photography and for the most part it seemed like the costumes hair way of speaking etc were accurate for the time period so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when but something just was n't quite right and it is hard to know exactly what it was i was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate i think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity i am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed so i would not recommend this film for families with young children because of the nudity ||| 0
i 'm a language teacher and i have a number of dvds that i use at school as language tools dvds are great because they 're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages but only when the dvds actually have other tracks than english nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this dvd seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie 's release on dvd i was pretty disappointed to discover just as the dvd was shipping that it was n't what i thought it was going to be i suppose it 's my fault for assuming but i feel ripped off just the same ||| 0
the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone the movie is a nokia product placement highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and conversely what a phone can do for you if you have one the plot centers on jessica kim basinger who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need mystery 1 what is it after lots of in various parts of the bad guys round up jessica 's family while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a day spa owner cop are trying to help them mystery 2 how will the cell phone save the day mystery 3. watch for the credits at the end of the film they show up on a yep you got it ||| 0
this is the worst transfer of a movie that is not a before dvd bootleg that i have ever seen many scenes in the daylight show a jiggling reflected lights or so it appears and lines dance around with the sound it was so bad i thought it was in individual damaged dvd until i read other reviews here and on imdb this is far worse than most cheapie transfers that are no longer owned but are in the public domain at least in those instances they usually have the excuse that the print they are working from is old and worn i have a much better video of exodus on vhs tape in ep ! and this movie is currently being offered at amazon for 14.95 do n't bother ! tape it off tcm and you 'll have a far higher quality visual record as for the movie itself despite good actors and one of the most wonderful music scores it 's very flat kirk douglas would have been a far better choice than newman who acts like he just came off a binge after a losing pool streak nonetheless it should not be sold with in lousy visual copies ||| 0

wow ! practice a few vapid platitudes and wield some handy aphorisms and sounding phrases change your voice and you too can be a channeler ! for money ! i 'm definitely in the wrong occupation has anybody ever thought to question ramtha '' on a few specifics that a year old being from atlantis '' should know did ramtha 's ancient society speak english what an amazing stroke of luck ! what did ramtha 's people do for agriculture and diet how was society structured what tools did they use and where was atlantis '' precisely located i 'm certain that archaelogists and anthropologists could benefit from such knowledge that such a wise being could impart after miraculously surviving 35 millenia or how many years precisely and in what reckoning could ramtha show us some writing samples in atlantean script linguists could help here or is it just possible that jz knight and her kind are great at pulling one over on us because we want and need to believe is n't that a more realistic explanation what does that say about those who buy into this ||| 0
even though i would agree that erin brockovich '' is an entertaining movie julia roberts performance in it is no more than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman '' i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath '' story but this movie has such shaky roots in reality it is more of a tall tale than the true '' story of a historic class action suit that i would imagine left more unhappy plaintiffs than it did satisfied ones however as the movie title implies this is indeed erin brockovich 's story in the same way that the xena '' character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess '' though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character erin brockovich is a vain brassy boorish single mother of three young children with no marketable work skills a transparently opportunistic manner who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in pretty woman '' prior to richard gere 's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree the movie 's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident her lawsuit is lost primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony swearing cursing and shrieking from the witness stand while being questioned by opposing counsel unbelievably erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney 's played by albert finney firm mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk later while handling the paperwork for a pro bono real estate sale erin discovers the file contains the seller 's medical records that for reasons she correctly does not understand seem to be of particular interest to the buyer the mega utility company pacific gas and electric erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg e had for decades negligently contaminated the ground water surrounding one of their power plants hinkley ca on the edge of the mojave desert with toxic hexavalent chromium this discovery leads to the queen mother of all lawsuits at least in terms of the award in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg e by and through the representation of erin 's boss in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs roberts gives a photogenic if not especially gifted performance in her role as erin the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts literally gushing out work clothes '' that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents while there is much to be said for erin 's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit she is not an especially likeable character rather she is rude verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry the aged and weary attorney who is erin 's boss the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy mules than on the personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters aaron eckhart plays the affable gentle biker and george who becomes erin 's the convenience '' factor is totally and for erin 's benefit exclusively she unabashedly uses george for free childcare thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar bonus '' check from masry when the tort action case settles contrastingly george gets a thanks '' for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed make no movie is about erin brockovich indeed i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present and less about the brave struggles with illnesses that the plaintiffs were forced to face due to the toxicity in their water source erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience in typical hollywood fashion as a sort of heroine but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich is the movie not even slightly ||| 0

while some movies require that you throw out your disbelief i had a very hard time doing so with this movie this movie was just plain stupid they should have kept this film story in the states once everything moves over to tokyo the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which i have n't seen in a long time i would have respected the film times more had it ended when the main character goes to japan so let 's get this straight japanese high school students act like american high school students lucas black 's character is simply told to go to a japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do everybody speaks english his father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that 's about double the size of his apartment i would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt looked and sounded more japanese japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet the japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful polite and dutiful real japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here actually they probably would n't be embarassed they would laugh at the film 's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true japanese culture japanese culture is not steeped in american hiphop and egocentric behavior and it 's a pity so many americans will see this film and actually think that japanese students are just like american students there would be nothing further from the truth japanese students do not act look or sound like what was filmed here not by a long shot given my dislike of how the japanese culture was handled in this film it left me finding the plot irrelevant the plot was ok but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of japanese culture or kept the story in the states ||| 0
i 'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon due to the utter vileness of this movie i saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it and then a friend purchased the dvd and convinced me to give it a second chance all in all this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that i will never get back the performances are thin and uneven the plot is inconsistent and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of friends to be fair this movie does face several major obstacles it has the misfortune to depend on the acting '' of glorified ken doll freddie prinze and the vastly overrated julia stiles and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges it also attempts to survive the intrusion of ashton kutcher it fails on all counts i do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre nor do i hate the teen '' movie under which some would place down to you '' in fact ca n't hardly wait '' is one of my favorite movies i simply hate bad movies and this movie is a true abomination if you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull then by all means buy this dvd if however you value your sanity then please do not make the same mistake i did stay far far away from this movie ||| 0

this dvd exposes the ultimate warrior as 25 postitive and 75 negative i do believe that jim hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis just another case of a wreslter who could n't seperate himself from the character and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges the only thing that bothers me is that jim hellwig was n't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions he was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact jim hellwig declined used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit this guy did make an impact in the wrestling world but it was too shortlived fans can chalk it up as a cool memory but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with flair piper hogan and the most respected of all the undertaker ||| 0
considering the sensational cast eli wallach terrence hill bud spencer kevin mccarthy and brock peters the era it was made in and the locations where it was shot ace high is a major disappointment the plot is uninvolving and incoherent the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever the editing looks like it was performed with a butcher 's knife after the first ten minutes i knew i 'd made a mistake buying it a boring 120 minute piece of junk ace high is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great italian westerns including corbucci 's the mercenary or parolini 's sabata series save your fistful of dollars for a better film ||| 0
rather than give another general review as others have kindly done my review focuses on one aspect of the film indeed one character that of martha martha dunstock is known throughout the film as martha dumptruck even the film credits include the nickname ' besides the character 's surname evidently feeling the need to labour the point portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given she unwittingly provides the slater character with information enabling him to murder a student later when the cult status of the ' that is murdered students becomes apparent martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic but her attempt is shown as a failure at the end of the film martha is bruised and now disabled in an electric wheelchair ryder 's character having finished her voyage of rejects the school prom night and instead invites martha to stay in with a video and popcorn martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show ryder walking along the corridor while martha encircles her like a planet around the sun the image of martha in her wheelchair an object of pity for ryder and for the audience signifies to us fears of being different of not being beautiful of not being loved and respected martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming she is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker and though some of us in the audience may be fat or disabled or both we may yet still fear martha and are invited to consider ryder 's protagonist 's journey of self discovery as our own even is in physical and social reality we are more like martha for this reason ' fails as an exploration of the ' of high school a description often used by firefly 's joss whedon those in the audience not as thin and complying with western standards of ' as the protagonists probably the majority of us ultimately may find the subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow leaving a bitter the way ' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers sadly this is happening even today in some ways it has gotten even worse since the western world decided to wage a 'war on fat ' to quote paul campos and even at best it is lazy ||| 0
those of you who remember ryan starr from american idol know why she quickly became has been '' material for 's the surreal life ryan starr also happens to be the worst actress i have ever watched on film television and or commercials the director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time her dialogue is kept short and simple and when she does have more than 3 lines at once the complete lack of feeling expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your that is all i can say i would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again ||| 0
whatever else the gltb community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy and that is a boldfaced lie featuring world famous funny man dom deluise the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two lesbians and sparks fly '' as it is the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe from the movie 's description and with deluise in a major role the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless does deluise know that the actresses are lesbians do the production 's other members does that derail the production what mayhem ensues in point of fact however the single attempt at comedy '' comes from deluise 's portrayal of the director as a prissy fastidious old queen pampered and catered to by his assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats the bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue as the actresses '' explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of lovers unfortunately there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore the few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their roles under deluise 's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic there is an inescapable feeling that the camera the viewer and deluise are intruders about the only thing that can be said about this film is that director lee friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street other reviewers have commented on the bad infomercial level acting of the two lead characters whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads robin greenspan and lacie harmon are actually lesbians simply playing themselves if so then this is bad acting if the women are straight however one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances sadly there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film ||| 0
normally i love documentaries i 've watched hundreds of them and with one exception i have loved them all however outfoxed is the single most boring film i have ever seen a relentless rant against rupert murdoch 's cable news station this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with fox news but i can not imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in fox news to remain awake while watching this movie watching outfoxed makes me realize what a genius michael moore is whether you love him or hate him whether you agree with him or not you have to admit his films are entertaining this film however is a major bore regina mcmenami ||| 0
to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky rodney eastman was in the movie for about 5 mins but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars ||| 0
con express '' has lots of action in it which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters unfortunately the action is n't enough and in between stunt pieces and the audience is tempted to doze off city heat productions is n't really known for producing films of the highest quality so usually i go easy on them if this were a company producing this i 'd be inclined to pan it entirely but i was n't expecting much and got a little more than i bargained for the action is for the most part pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie flanery and vosloo are perfectly casted but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals the film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like under siege 2 con air spy game and speed if you liked those you probably wo n't mind this one too much just go easy on it ||| 0
i was trying to think of the best short description of what this is sure it 's a propaganda film but that does n't mean much to most people however most people have seen attack ads around election time that 's what this is a very long political attack ad full of all the things we commonly see in such ads distortions sarcasm scary close ups mood music mocking tone glaring omissions out of context quotes etc that said the most rewarding review so far must be the one by at dl '' new york who basically condemns michael moore as because fahrenheit does n't say bush engineered himself what 's next a review that condemns at dl '' new york as because his review did n't say that bush flew the planes himself or that bush is an alien who gave birth to saddam and osama on a ufo just when you think you 've seen the craziest conspiracy theory ||| 0
the dvd for the golden coach '' is for the most part fine but the final minutes which are crucial to the full impact of the film are ruined by deplorable mastering the scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening i believe criterion made some kind of mastering error because martin scorsese 's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film criterion should withdraw the dvd and offer a replacement ||| 0
i was very disappointed with steve 's performance eventhough it took a lot out of him to refrain from swearing his material towards the end of the show began to dwindle to the point that it just became plain ignorant especially in the part where he was expressing how he would kill someone '' and gloating bout it after i bought it i later caught it on a cable network god may not be through with him yet '' but it will be up to him steve to repent on his own this may be good humor for a more complacent christian audience ||| 0
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters ||| 0
i have been a le carre fan until the end of the cold war i somehow still managed to follow him later for some time but now it is over definitely i disliked this novel and the movie is obnoxious rachel weisz is quite ridiculous in her part which idiot nominated her for her oscar is beyond the point zellweger got an oscar for an even more horrible performance recently in the otherwise quite acceptable cold mountain and even the otherwise great blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in the aviator to get one why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies my conclusion this world is strange it has no idea what is good and what not ||| 0
completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his play watching the first fifteen minutes of heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads heads '' is colossal torture like status elipticus it 's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen having hopes it might pick up that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums do n't take my word for it watch it yourself and see ||| 0
susan ward coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward then give this a movie a try if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future don '' t find it here ||| 0
i ordered these and several other movies from the tyler perry collection only to find that they were not actual movies but plays i returned them and was charged a high restocking fee not ok ! no where in the description was mention of them being stage plays i will order my cd 's and dvd 's from another source in the future ||| 0
this is a pure from the cover of aerosmith 's live bootleg album from 1978 where 's the shame too bad twilight are not original enough to come up with their own cover in another words this dvd is pretty suck and the originality here is nowhere to be found especially on the cover art that they stole from a much bigger band ||| 0
shame on talented actors like maura tierney and jerry orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it star '' john romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time and this is his only film and i can see why he plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by tierney who also works in a local factory run by orbach dennis christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator and june lockhart and lyle waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as tierney 's estranged parents the movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it 's so shoddily included it makes no statement at all little heard of movie i can see why ||| 0
cesar milan the 'dog whisperer ' bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status and that you need to use painful 'corrections ' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it yes dogs do have dominance roles but that has n't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors dogs do 'bad ' doggy behaviors because they work dog guards his food bowl dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away dog pulls on the leash dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up the dog does n't care whether or not you 're alpha he only cares that what he 's doing works to get him what he wants technically cesar 's methods work but they use force fear and pain to teach the dog when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and techniques i have three hyper active highly driven border collies and they 're all very obedient and mannerly they do n't haul me around the leash nor do they leap at guests nor do they ignore me when i tell them something and i do n't need to be 'alpha ' to get them that way neither does anyone else i strongly suggest that you do n't buy this item good books to start with are karen pryor 's 'getting started clicker training for dogs ' melissa alexander 's 'click for joy ! ' also with a great problem solving section and jean donaldson 's 'the culture clash ' you can easily have a happy obedient well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain ||| 0
i agree these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason they are not that good ok there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying i love charlie murphy and the ashy guy and i think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny dave come back to tv ||| 0
the sound on this dvd is absolutely horrible the dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering i also have the vhs on which the sound is perfect so i can still watch this wonderful movie but i would sure like to get my money back for the dvd ||| 0
this review is more about the superbit '' transfer of the movie to dvd than the movie itself the movie itself is great and i highly recommend it however the transfer on to this 2002 superbit '' version is very lacking in several areas the superbit idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer the original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features like trailers documentaries featurettes and '' snippets to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality they have failed to do that here the video and audio quality are not what they could be first the movie is encoded onto a rsdl disc this means the dvd is capable of storing 9.5 gb of data however not even 6 gb is used as a result the video and audio quality is not what it could be panic room '' is a 112 minute movie any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a disc at maximum encoding rate provided no extra features are placed on the disc the maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour or less movie onto a disc is 9.8 mbps however this superbit version averages only 6.5 mbps this superbit version offers audio encoding in 3 types dolby 2.0 surround dolby digital 5.1 and dts at first glance this is great news until you discover that the dts encoding is n't as high quality as it could be the dd 2.0 surround is presented at a bitrate of as expected so is the dd 5.1 at the expected rate dts 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps this is unsatisfactory given the fact that of the available disc space of the is n't even used the dts encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this this would represent a 33 increase in filespace for the audio portion but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear the filespace increase would be only about 256 mb which is very reasonable when you have over 3 gb of space not even being used if they had encoded panic room '' on this superbit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 mbps and removed the trailers and features they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above especially the dts 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate i stated such an encoding process would have used 9.4 gb of the 9.5 gb of available space a much better way to fill up the disc and adhere to the spirit of the superbit ideal the result would have been a movie encoded to at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc i notice that they will be offering a repackaged superbit version in october 2006. hopefully that version will fix the flaws i just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both and it might even offer the better 6.1 and 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many receivers can process now another thing i am noticing is that many times for popular movies they are released them in editions the first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff if the movie contains both dd and dts encodings on the first disc with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 mbps or greater it is already in the superbit mold ||| 0
i got nothing to say was this supposed to be intense was this supposed to be a thriller it was boring horrible acting except for forest whitaker but even he could n't save this one pure fincher pure trash horrible horrible horrible quite possibly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen i am just too upset to type i ca n't believe i actually waisted my time with this ||| 0
terrible direction terrible writing it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid it was a total watse of good celluloid ||| 0
the film deserves 5 stars but the dvd only gets 1. why no letterbox format after waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on dvd why would they give us full screen pan scan yes the quality and color are great but oh what we 're missing on the sidelines ||| 0
many people had reccomended this movie to me but it failed to live up to its reputation the quality of the was aweful the acting bad to the point of utter ridiculousness and the script read like a cross between a psychotherapists analysis and one of those pulp romance novels about angsty teenagers it gets some credit toward the end for showing some of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was there were some cute moments and it was interesting to see the humble roots of one of the big l word ladies but do n't go into this movie expecting a highly polished end product ||| 0

the hospital '' as as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience it is not so much a dark comedy but a one i was a fan of paddy chayefsky 's network '' and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness i 'm led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole if george 's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he 's not brooding drinking or contemplating suicide he 's off on some rant diana rigg is completely wasted in this film her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short and be ravaged by scott 's character the film is also not helped by the direction of arthur hiller the medical profession can be lampooned but do n't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film ||| 0

betty hutton has a colossal amount of energy she seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining she 's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers her voice is sturdy durable indestructible but oh my god her acting choices she and the indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film whereas buffalo bill allegedly a character looks like a corpse by comparison and howard keel in only his second film must manage to act like these are human beings he 's relating to take a look at betty hutton 's reaction upon seeing howard keel for the first time the mugging would be considered a bit much '' if seen from the back row of an amphitheater at best her performance is clownlike at worst it 's apelike little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity it 's a magnificent effort and a stunning testimony to her desire to please but her comedy has no reality no nuance no connection to any sincere emotion she seizes on hick '' and drives that into the ground then she plays nothing but infatuated '' for a while before toggling to resentful '' and so forth it 's a series of masks and set pieces but it 's not a character judy garland was in sad shape at that point in her life but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind annie 's moments and she would n't have neglected annie 's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes nobody can do vulnerability like judy and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors both qualities that would serve this character annie could be a wonderful character a great mess of strength longing guts femininity skill naivete and worldiness all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man but instead betty hutton makes her a crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet i am surprised that hutton did n't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out maybe they just would n't let her the scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide i kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on and the memory of betty hutton 's performance is branded on my brain but it 's because this performance seems like it 's following the traditions of some other culture some other world it 's like going to a sideshow that said the tunes are a parade of hits there probably is n't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another in wildly different styles with effective melodies worth remembering the classic tunes just keep coming the movie works as spectacle and songfest and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness but if you 're looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes ||| 0
i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more ||| 0
michael moriarity is my hero ! he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion he has done such great as this q and it 's alive 3 island of the alive how awesome is he anyways i think that this movie was hilarious ! i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously thinking that it is going to be your typical movie but you should n't because not only is this a but it is supposed to be funny my favorite part is when the stuff '' started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it who would do that i just started laughing by butt off when that happened so if you watch this movie just sit back and enjoy it for what it 's worth do n't be too critical on it what i learned from the stuff dairy products are evil ! especially if they come from with in the earth ! if you like the stuff i recommend watching other such as island of the alive 3 zombi 3 and 4 etc ||| 0
i love jeff goldblum but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore yuck ! and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters stay goldblum the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better ||| 0
i am a big fan of frank miller 's work and i loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from when i saw this film i was blown away by the visuals it had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything i had seen in a movie before having mentioned it 's good points i have to say i was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen it seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen for the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through i had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet each extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like i was being mugged what works in a graphic novel does n't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you 'll see here all the characters were severely and tragically with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience also many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here purists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film however my bottom line opinion is it 's a good film to watch for the visual look only but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the 'mute ' button on this film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark ||| 0
incredible does describe this incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning '' or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi '' or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she 's only worthy of miss congeniality '' type crud mcconaughey over acts so much as can be said for keifer sutherland and others that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film '' it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning '' that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies ||| 0

i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays even rent this i dont even know why you are considering the film i only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since ||| 0
i read some good reviews about this movie in adition i respect french 's cinema they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies so i bought spanish apartment '' a big dissapointment hughe one it 's candid it 's naive '' it 's boring with poor ideas poor acting very predictable there 's a lot of good movies around you do n't waste your time in this one ||| 0
bette midler and woody allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as bette and woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school they also discover that they have been cheating on one another the movie gets boring rather fast as bette and woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters i would have expected better from these two ||| 0
several reasons apparently the other online reviewers are extremely in their critiques of this film the dvd 's jacket has a quote from rolling stone '' think 'sex and the city ' with men ! '' well i say think again '' as an avid watcher of sex and the city '' this film has little if any comparison to satc firstly this film is not a comedy there were very small instances when i kind of chuckled but could barely muster a real laugh actually towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that i kept hitting fast forward on the remote those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what i mean here ! the characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person 's life these disjointed glimpses do n't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters yes they are all bored whether they are in their 30 's or their 50 's yes they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs i usually enjoy movies with this type of plot for example pane e tulipani bread and tulips facing windows also starring giovanna mezzogiorno and a much better film under the tuscan sun shirley valentine a month by the lake etc the last kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do however the viewer is left with no warm feelings about life 's decisions only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film ||| 0
i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004. i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie but it was really lackluster the acting is wooden the script is very lame and worst of all the action is n't very exciting i expected a much better movie from director richard donner there is a battle scene and there are action scenes but they just are n't exciting when the action is n't exciting you better have a good story the story here is alright but certainly not enough to save the movie i do n't hate any of the actors they are decent when they have something to work with here they had nothing to work with so they obviously did n't do too well this time this really is n't worth your time i gave this to the thrift shop after i got it and i feel sorry for the person who bought it there ||| 0
this movie was awesome ! ben stiller is a comic genius he 's the new jerry lewis ! deniro awesome ! hoffman awesome ! streisand awesome and still very sexy for an old liberal ho ! i thought the sight gags were priceless and the plot line serene ! this was hollywood movie watching heaven ! this film should have won some academy awards ! i mean if marisa torme can win for my cousin vinnie these actors should 've at least been nominated ! this is a highly entertaining film and i recommend it to every and anyone to see but wear your depends because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard ! dubya 99 you do n't know what in the friggin ' h e l l you 're talking about ! yeah like we 're suppose to take the opinion of an loser that complains about going out to the movies stay home i 'm sure dateline nbc will be calling soon about that episode they had recently ||| 0
this truly is a horrible movie 7 seconds huh yeah 7 seconds to realize i made a mistake in renting it the acting is horrible the plot is horrible the filming is horrible everything is horrible ! i was hopeful because of snipes which is why i rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters the guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie ! snipes could n't even do the fight scenes and make them look real the ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love ! huh they were a romantic interest they hinted at it but never showed this happening do not rent or buy this movie stay away or you will be sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie ||| 0
i loved the original movie and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be wrong wrong ! ! first of all the child actors were horrible well the charlie and mike characters were ok but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder ||| 0
the books are witty and charming this in stark contrast is formulaic schlock americans and much of the world 's consumers prefer their entertainment predigested so it does n't require chewing so they consume the same nutritionless movieland cliches endlessly in the land of limitless equality everything is reduced to equal tastelessness if you want impart the capacity for discernment to your child you could start by avoiding this twaddle the eloise books are special while this movie is mere product ||| 0
when i purchased this dvd i was hoping to get the complete an unbiased presentation from scratch i could sense what was to come bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this dvd it is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted what little was discussed appeared to be very tainted i definitely did not expect national geographic to come up with this kind of a dvd i will definitely think ten times before i purchase anything from them maybe they should just stick to and leave alone ||| 0
though i 'm still a big south park fan i do think that the quality of the show has progressively declined over the past three seasons this season has its standouts most notably the truly demented christmas critters episode but it also has incredibly lame episodes like the dance off and election episodes to make matters worse matt and trey put next to no effort into providing any extras for fans who pony up top dollar for the dvd collections a show like the simpsons not only has more episodes per season and sells for the same price but the people involved in the simpsons go the extra mile to satisfy fans full episode commentaries with writers producers directors voice actors etc as well as deleted scenes and other special features matt and trey provide generally uninteresting mini commentaries '' no doubt about it the boys are just generally phoning it in '' at this point seemingly caring only about continuing their franchise and maximizing their profits for as little effort as possible ||| 0
i hear this is a good movie but ca n't play it as the dvd is visibly damaged so what about quality control this disc should never have gotten out the door but the odd thing is i ordered 2 dvd 's from amazon different titles both damaged are you guys buying and pawning them off on us f ||| 0

another product of hollywood 's karaoke culture '' in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind we have in '' an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of das boot '' but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war we get a cheap pile of hollywood propaganda the lighting camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db but the bigoted innacuracies german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors and absurd scenarios an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit put this ridiculous movie in its own category is just another thin movie you 'll forget the day after you see it ||| 0
sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful ||| 0
sure this movie is a classic but is it any good frankly i found it to be tedious in the extreme it 's certainly pleasant to look at the sets are quite amazing and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful the story as described in detail in many other reviews here has potential as both a thriller and a essay ultimately it is neither the acting is top notch as are all of the special effects those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory in fact all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic but the whole thing never rises to its premise its thriller '' aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed the only key that can stop the nuke ! the resolution is an afterthought a quick fix in the extreme and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is narrowly whew ! averted the characters are thin at best and stock at worst this movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early thought technology would be like in the mid yawn i must laugh at the whole bit it means nothing to the plot and is the ultimate contrivance if a deadly virus actually came back from space there would certainly be action on many fronts with plenty of interesting conflict to go around some people would try to understand it others would want only to kill it there 's some potentially interesting tension right there some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public others would want to warn them again that could have been a good source of tension someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon mentioned in passing but never developed while others would try very hard to prevent that more tension i 'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly scenes which it actually contains this movie is the poster child for boring science fiction and it would not have had to be that way i have n't read the book but i bet it 's a lot better at its core this movie is a boring dud ||| 0
not only was the dialogue of the film trite and the plot much like a pornographic after school special but the movie unfortunately reinforces a worldview which groups been touting for years if you 're thinking turning your female frienship into a relationship do n't the lesbian always goes crazy and dies in the end if you 're interested in finding out what i 'm talking about lisa duggan explains how this ideology gets transimitted and reinforced in her book sapphic slashers also if you 're interested in watching a film about lesbian love please do yourself a favor and check out the incredible true story of two girls in love or but i 'm a cheerleader support movies that actually advance queer causes instead of making all of us look like freaks ||| 0
the shows themselves are wonderful but the people who put together this dvd set should be ashamed of this paltry effort ! there are no cast or staff interviews about the ending of such a wonderful series no commentaries no english no john spencer honorarium of any kind they did n't even take the time to include the 1 hour of the original pilot they aired before the finale ! the only extras '' are two special features dealing with the debate this dvd set is definately not worth the money to buy it brand new ||| 0

i hated this movie so unrealistic sure maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating but i am a teenager in a city nobody acts like this ! what the hell is the point of this movie to scare the crap out of parents also the rape scene was vile at first i respected the director for showing it and not shying away a full minute later i started feeling awkward and uncomfortable it was n't even artistic it was just disgusting and truly disturbing ||| 0
margarett mitchell must be rolling in her grave she wrote a masterpiece in the 1930 's then alexandra ripley bought the rights to her book by conning margaret mitchell 's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative alexandra ripley 's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush even worse than a barbara courtland romance novel beautiful costumes and a good cast but the script is a soap opera and very poorly written with too many cliche 's the tv movie version is even worse than alexandra ripley 's book i would have given this movie zero stars but gave it 2 stars solely for the world class acting of sean bean as the deliciously evil lord fenton sean bean heats up the screen as a sexy feral villian along the lines of the man you love to hate '' as an unsafe sex symbol unless you are a sean bean fan there is nothing worthwhile about this film the script is trite cliche 'd and very slow moving sean bean is only in disc 1 and his character is eliminated and the movie slides downhill from there disc 2 is overwrought with very boring drawn out courtroom scenes i was almost rooting that scarlett would be hanged for the murder just to see an end to this movie ! i 've always liked joanna and timothy dalton they are excellent actors wasted in this pile of mush movie 's performance as belle watling is so bad i wanted to slap her do yourself a favor and watch the original gone with the wind starring clark gable and vivien leigh if you want to see a wonderful film ||| 0
i 've loved this movie ever since i saw it on cbs years ago so i was really excited to own it on dvd unfortunately the experience was ruined when i discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene i was very dissapointed the movie is great but the sound problems are n't worth the purchase stay away ||| 0
the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on '' to one plot point after another previous reviewers have covered these absurdities the underlying scenario was unconvincing and previous reviews in this thread provide details ||| 0

whatever ills are in the world it 's all the fault of the corporations that 's the basic premise of this terribly misguided and totally movie for example instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work they forget that these people 's alternatives are even worse and that 's why they took that job in the first place ! these jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and if they chose that job freely it must be their best option no matter how crazy it seems to us as people 's skills rise as opportunities increase over time by having more corporations and not less to create more competition for these people 's labor and as the country becomes wealthier these people 's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact the wages of the whole country on the average there are no shortcuts to his a famous story comes from nepal where labor laws at the urging of the un turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs as sad as it may be were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families it 's a slow process but all the industrialized nations went through that process shortcuts '' usually produce results which are even worse however the results speak for themselves in very short period of time for example hundrds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty in china india and around the world thanks for the evil '' capalism its corporations no other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in china and india alone also cost of living is very low there so these pennies really can go a long way do n't measure it to the cost of living in the west what is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people i guess to let people starve to death then the makers of this movie do n't have have anyting to complain about ! other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who 's a psychopath a corpoartion is a legal entity yes and may act like a separate being '' as far the law in concerned but does a corporation have a nose feet stomach can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis of course not than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it several of the main spokepersons '' in the movie chomsky michael moore rifkin and others are renowned for their comments which frequently have no basis in any kind of economics or reality to correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie you 'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are throughout the whole movie you 're basically bombarded by arguments with very little of the other side presented despite the director 's claim of the opposite claim it 's more like 80 -20 just look at chomsky 's comments about how the consumers are so stupid they do n't realize that all the things they buy they do n't really need i mean we do n't need fashionable clothes hey let 's all dress as boring as chomsky ! dvd players or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun who is the judge of what you really need chomsky of course he is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you do n't you 're too stupid to know what you want according to him he says that you should do more important things '' like perhaps studying lingistics which he teaches but which very few care about the movie does make some correct and good observations especially regarding polution however i 'd say that 80 of the movie is factually and logically flawed it 's also full of economic fallacies it 's worth watching i guess just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie despite all the ranting in the movie it fails to mention the biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up too much governement interference is every facet of life for examples how could a government of brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water ! how could the government do so many things for private companies with public funds just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies forbid government corporate welfare of any kind forbid subsidies to companies cut the suffocating red tape and regulation esp in developing countries but in the west too cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10 and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing give people all around the world a better life increase competition etc if these and other governments and not corporations ' problems were eliminated the vast majority of all the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away an interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to century rural lifestile spoken about with much admiration people with no understanding about economics how the world really works and how to really raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for ||| 0

i was thrilled when i first read that mlb productions was finally issuing a dvd version of highlights of the baltimore orioles ' three world series victories i already owned the vhs versions one of which the 1970 world series had a major flaw in the audio synchronization watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film finally i could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 world series much to my dismay the mlb logo is permanently and obtrusively displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs what 's that all about does mlb productions think i 'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills thank goodness i do n't own a plasma tv or i 'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years ! sound and picture quality are okay otherwise but logo is really annoying ||| 0
the movie directors in the me particularly iranians are responding to demands by the west for certain type of movies they produce what is demanded from them in turn they receive awards cultural industry empowers these demands they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded there is no single me movie which depict the story of western imperialism in the me and then awarded for doing so me movies must show that me women are in need of emancipation me cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized civilization itself is presented in vertical sense there is a civilization somewhere out there all measterners are expected to reach yet it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country who deprived them of education and knowledge the west is represented by beautiful blonde nurses a nice american guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his everyday western knowledge of medicine '' in the midst of total ignorance and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs such a nice way to civilize ! the story of afghanistan is real however the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it rather it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand in producing a product that can sell well the situation is miserable but what caused such misery in afghanistan your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is islam it is that islamic culture that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors there is no single implying in the movie a smallest reference that afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the british and then the russian and now americans who played their great game on the chessboard of eurasia there is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them those imperialists came in the name of civilization french did to algeria the british did to india all in the name of bringing them civilization it was white man 's burden to do so yet makhmalbaf needs more awards he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of western audiences in order to continue to be in demand you did a nice job applauses go on anyone who is interested in cultural imperialism should read foucault 's works and edward said 's orientalism ||| 0
in the film commentary director robert altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying 'i do n't know what it was about but i really liked it ' that 's a paraphrase and i think that 's the key to why this film is so bad the director did n't know what it was about the weird atonal score by gerald busby was an annoyance throughout often drowning out the dialog it 's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear or in a psychological thriller just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho only in this film the creepy music played on and on that was it no nuances no alteration no variance no imagination just the same creepy atonal 'psycho ' music all the time duvall and spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time and sequences conveying mystery suspense drama what got it they convey confusion ! that 's it ! the was confused ! a waste of talent and a waste of my time watching it it is one of those films i watched thinking it had to get better it did n't ||| 0
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information and to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond we are truly in trouble the truth is out there and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd but this dvd is maybe worth a glance but not a long hard look ||| 0
this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke ||| 0
this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies gee another movie with a black guy hello eddie murphy who because it 's perfectly fine in pc hollyweird calls charlie sheen and everyone else who is not black a host of nasty names the movie is a mess let 's see the protagonist tucker plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a is chased around by cops and the bad guys the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds sheen is supposed to be a but like most of his other movies he sleepwalks through it clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along first screenwriter '' '' hey bob what will we have tucker do next hey i know let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names '' second screenwriter '' hey great idea fred i sure do n't have any ideas '' apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a of murphy the trickster flicks basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name if that 's your idea of humor i pity you ||| 0

i have only one question about this movie and that is why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book if you have n't read the book than you do n't know what i 'm talking about but if you have then you do i ca n't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would 've been if it had been adapted correctly half the time while watching this i felt as if i was watching teletubies or something the colors were so bright if this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes locations characters and details from the story then everyone would love it not just 5 year olds it makes me so angry when i watch this movie yes its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing everytime i loan someone the book i have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all in fact it is a hundred times better more even i am really disappointed i just do n't get how gail carson levine would agree to all the changes that were made if someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie than i suggest they do it right and if they do then i 'll be very thankful i just do n't get it the book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better you would n't believe how much better it is i am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book next time please please do it right ||| 0
first of all 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks second of all i missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain also regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises it is still moderately difficult ||| 0
saw this as an inflight movie boy did i pray for engine trouble so we 'd have to land and i could get away ! sucks or what i liked smith in 'i robot ' 'independence day ' etc but this was awful it 's a movie problem is the one joke was the one plastered all over the tv spots and trailers the jet ski incident the highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool wish that 'd been the main storyline instead far far superior ! will not be adding this to my wishlist ||| 0
i can not get thru this one i started but there did n't appear to have any good spots when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this i thought this has to be good i had just finished a movie where he starred ca n't remember the name of it i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it tori spelling is well known but not to me someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start she does not play a flake very well and i do n't know what to call her except a flake i stopped this dvd in about the first hour and will go back and give it another shot but with tori spelling as one of the leads i already know this one does not have a prayer i would say save your money on this one unless you are under 13. i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that do n't this one falls into this category one that came with this one was the broken hearts club '' and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage ||| 0
the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this to catch it on tbs or something ||| 0
wow it 's rare i consider a movie absolutely horrendous but this one qualifies we are given absolutely no reason whatsoever to care for this guy and halfway through this tedious excuse for a movie i found myself yelling die already '' when he does n't kill himself in the end all i wanted to do was shove him face down in the ocean and drown him a dumb stupid awful indie '' movie that is a waste of film time and effort ||| 0
im a huge fan of writer sean mcginly his classics include venomous starring treat williams and sonic impact with mcginly 's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film two days i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast which included hacks like paul rudd was not in the same league as superstars traci bingham and who have graced some of his previous work please sean stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff leave that to idiots like capra wenders scorcese etc they are not in your league ||| 0
i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my days in elementary school this video made its rounds in the public schools the songs are catchy and the film quality is good but make no mistake this is propaganda aimed at children i will not be showing it to my kids despite the freewheeling title the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys case in point atalanta a princess finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world on her father 's horse she also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of ladies first '' the tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron the narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal our hosts '' infant puppets voiced by mel brooks and marlo thomas are revolting there should be a law against using mel brooks ' voice for a baby apparently i repressed memories of these creatures but seeing them again brought back the horror needless to say i fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry overall this dvd is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children ||| 0
saw the previews of the first movie but i was n't expecting too much from that i tried to finish both the first and the second but that did n't work out too well i felt these films did n't deserved to be watched all the way to the end i do n't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie and that includes the first all i really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it y'all should really consider watching cops and those insane police chases shown on tv after all this is just another episode of cops with guest actors in it ||| 0
ca n't remember when i 've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this a silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer down on his luck the writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property and hides his car trying to escape a finance the threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine in one early scene they have a funeral casket and all for a monkey yuk gloria swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script though she despises movies that talk '' she waves her hands about and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene she falls for the screen writer william holden and wo n't let him out of her sight the film was made in 1950 and swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50 not exacty over the hill if we look at many of today 's movie stars but she 's treated in the film as though she much much older i thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film my heavens at 50 she could still be in movies and from the amount of money she apparently had did n't need to be living in such a dark creepy house film did n't make sense sorry i bought it it was ridiculous ||| 0

this movie is one of cinema history 's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success saturday night fever '' from a few years before is another example but that movie could actually stand on its own jennifer beales ' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside i do n't think this one could i understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80 's children and i will agree this is one of the great soundtracks of cinema the problem is the movie 's plot is a wasted opportunity physically beales is sexy enough to keep your attention and her portrayal of girl in a man 's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made but her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character come to think of it the acting all around is a bit weak but that 's not the problem the movie suffers from two fatal the first is the plot itself depictions aside it 's pretty simplistic unimaginative stuff even for a dance movie what 's worse is how slow it all moves the drama sequences dances drag on straining your patience and sympathy for the character 's plights the other more tragic flaw since it is a movie about dance is the cinematography while it 's certainly not the worst cinematography ever check out the limey '' next time you want a headache the dance sequences look like they 've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor we 're supposed to be moved by beales ' character 's natural talent but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits by the time the final dance scene finally comes along the drama of her audition performance is ruined by bad editing it almost seems the judges let her into juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute perhaps i 'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than editing but if it 's a movie about dancing one would think the least they could do is show dancing many movies before and after flashdance managed to get this right saturday night fever '' certainly did to its great success but maybe nobody told this movie 's director it 's a shame ||| 0
believe it or not i actually wanted to watch this movie i 've seen almost everything else adrian lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts i watched 's because i remembered an intriguing preview on a vhs cassette i watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on sealed the deal my girlfriend owns a copy of lyne 's version of was a girlfriend induced rental i watched the tv version of i have n't seen but i read the book flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you 've never seen it and i always wanted to hear the song maniac '' in its original context so when i found it on an acquaintances shelf i popped it in so how was it not too bad not great by any means or even really that good and 's are both quite good but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work the plot is a believe in your dreams '' story with really lame dialog but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like i was watching an abstract silent film i do n't know squat about dancing but the choreography seemed innovative at least for its time i ca n't even remember the names of the characters but all in all i have to admit that it was kind of neat also if you watch it with the subsequent years of movies in mind can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from hollywood it 's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack joe esterhasz and was produced by jerry bruckheimer ! taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60 of all crap movies made since ||| 0
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then ||| 0

first of all i am a joy division and new order fan therefore i tried to like this really i did sadly this film stinks the focus is not on the bands themselves but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson what a monster ! either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life maybe i 'm not british but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny only a few scenes made me grin the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film in addition the camera work was very jerky looked like it was done by a novice and yes i 'm one myself having made two movies the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division too bad the members of this band are minor characters i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much much better ||| 0

incredible does describe this incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning '' or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi '' or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she 's only worthy of miss congeniality '' type crud mcconaughey over acts so much as can be said for keifer sutherland and others that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film '' it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning '' that has both a great script and fabulous acting i do n't know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies ||| 0
i went into this movie thinking it would be great to see a film set in the turbulent but interesting history of first settlements in the far north of northern america having only really seen pocahontas through the eyes of disney i felt this would be a good chance to see something more significant and engaging on one of histories more interesting events like other reviewers i found the photography and the scenery to be simply stunning visually the film wows the viewer the scenes simply amaze with their beauty the sets with their majesty and also rustic simplicity coupled with the musical score this was some of the best camera work i have seen in a long time this was in my opinion the sole redeeming feature of the film while the filme attempted to contemplate serious and deep issues of love allegiance and so on it succeeded in only boring the tears out this viewer with the monotonous monologues of the characters done as long lengths of naration in one part the plot lost some continuity and needed reviewing to get to grips with what had happened for actors of the calibre of colin farrell and christian bale this film did not show them at their best certainly not the worst i have seen by any stretch but definitely not the best i have seen from either one of these actors tread with caution on this one and hire it before you buy it i am glad i did not spend good money purchasing it quite frankly it is a great cure for insomnia ||| 0
the new world is the least of terrence malick 's limited filmography to date and could be best described as a monotone poem it 's not exactly bad just mundane and rather forgettable even while you 're watching it more of a than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions against selections from his classical music collection which does n't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific colin farrell a nice enough lad offscreen i 'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just can not carry a picture no matter how many chances he 's given true to form he trots out his two picture ' expressions the one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he 's not been getting enough roughage in his diet the fact that he 's outshone by q'orianka kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy although to be fair he has been worse indeed among the male leads christian bale does much much more with much much less in the last third of the film as does a typically underused christopher plummer in the first third malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of jamestown but because it happens to people we 've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight if anything it just made me think of how much more herzog could have made of it all moments work most notably the expulsion of the ' from their land and the brief latter sequences in england but on the evidence of the version i very much doubt malick 's promised longer cut will solve the problems i know it 's meant to be a work of art but i just came away with the feeling that i 'd watched an old and very average universal international western redubbed by philosophy students the only surprise was that jeff chandler and his bouncing basques did n't crop up ||| 0
me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films and we do really like the thin red line but this was a real boring piece of film making whole film was just one huge poetry reading and i prefer to read poetry from a book just does n't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by george the battle scenes were just poetry readings thin red line instead if you are interested in this director 's work that film is a masterpiece isn't ||| 0

this is an extremely dry anime the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor not so for the anime the character batou was especially funny in the manga but for reasons unknown he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking these really make the movie crawl one minute there 's action next you 're listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism seriously these little talks take up of the movie the visuals are awesome no question about that even so they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story altogether not much actually happens during the movie if you must see it rent it first to be sure you want it ||| 0
before i review i 'd like to clear something up i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim ghost in the shell standalone complex i absolutely love that show and so i figured eventually i 'd have to get around to seeing the movie which i knew full well shares no connection with the show they 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name which i have not read so i do n't know which is more accurate but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way there are many things i do n't like about this movie the biggest being poor pacing the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler but that 's the biggest problem there 's not really enough story to last a feature because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short and since they did n't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes there are barely any and they are n't very impressive for the most part they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you wo n't understand more than 60 of and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we 're looking at either nothing or a woman 's nipples that 's not cinematic artistry that 's being either lazy or perverted the animation itself is n't even that good especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago it 's choppy and there 's not really a whole lot of detail except when it comes to women 's nipples looking at just the animation if i did n't know better i 'd have thought this movie was an ova from the 1980 's the only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell it 's probably kind of like how i did n't see the 1989 batman movie until years after i 'd been spoiled by batman the animated series and could n't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman everything about the tv series is superior to this movie the animation the stories the character developement the production values i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is in short if you 're you 're at all interested in the gits franchise do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead you 'll find a lot to love but i ca n't say the same about the movie my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex ||| 0

i gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary it falls more along the same fodder as spinal tap '' it is missing a counter point from gm one could argue that roger had chances to talk with moore but choose not to one the other hand rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold i believe that moore counted on not being granted air time at gm for the production of this film an interview would have killed the tone watch the nightly news now last night march 2006 gm offered a one time buy out to some of it 's employees the news reported that gm can not afford to maintain its relationship with the uaw just like what caused the flint situation in the film this same thing happened in the late 1980 's and brought forth this extremely biased movie this film is entertaining in a strange way but should not be considered to be the absolute truth watch it with a grain of salt for what it 's worth under close examination careful consideration and keen intellect you will see a undercover message you might need to examine closely the content outwardly things are not what they seem until you look more closely many times the basic concept is misread in the dialog once you see this and open your mind to it rational thought will emerge ||| 0
therese lux mary bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls ages 13 14 15 16 and 17. cecilia the youngest lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict and lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age and lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room on the second floor of a house and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon 's neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death '' and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip can not help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip 's request knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick of course but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once and lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation '' the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe and lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown '' which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future ||| 0

for that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of dirty secrets covered up i feel that it 's the most insulting film to be released it hides the fact that we as citizens and our government do n't really care about who we stick in office if the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up i ca n't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time and believe me i do n't feel it 's right to air it all over the news either i feel that it comes down to the man and if he does have the values party believes in then he will do the honorable thing and own up to mistake this movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it 's alright to cover things up and there are no absolutes or rights or wrongs wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who 's rich do we wait until then to change the moral that 's pathetic and so is this movie ||| 0

who 's idea was it to put jessica alba as sue storm chris evans 's portrayal of johnny storm was somewhat disappointing too although not as bad as jessica alba 's portrayal of sue storm why do they cast hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies they really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters this movie was somewhat good but it did n't feel all that great so far this movie is just another of marvel 's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of elektra the incredible hulk xmen 3 daredevil and the punisher i was so happy to see marvel characters getting their own movies but after seeing what hollywood does to them i would rather see marvel 's chracters go back into hiding special effects were good in this movie and so was the story michael chiklis as the thing was great and his the thing character makeup was done very well and he played the character well too as did ioan gruffud with fantastic jessica alba and chris evans definitely demoted this movie ||| 0
the central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920 's robin hood and his band of gangsters unfortunately even the rat pack can not save this movie the script is slow dated and dull barbara rush 's scenes are especially confusing her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie nothing comes of her apparent interest in sinatra or martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut the main actors seemed to be bored and with the exceptions of bing crosby and peter falk walked through their performances maybe they were hung over most of the time save your money and borrow it from your local library ||| 0
well folks looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here crash '' comes close but that film has a lot more detractors than this one and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined somehow that it would change the world '' my beefs are not the same as most of those who do n't like the film i do n't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse nor do i find it overly depressing fact is it is n't depressing at all cause i did n't care it 's just boring and annoying sometimes at different moments sometimes simultaneously this not a good combination all right here 's a plot summary jared leto marlon wayans jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs and this really messes up their lives i hate to give it all away like that but there it is the fundamental flaw is this i do n't like any of these people so their pain does n't mean anything and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would 've worked but now there just is n't anything there as far as what 's actually in the movie we 've got jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly who wants to be a fashion designer or something beyond this we 've got jared 's mother ellen burstyn who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto 's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues i particularly love how there 's no real attempt to make wayans into a person he 's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that 's it the doubly sad fact is that he 's the most likable of the three he at least displays a little life connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it 's a wonder that the smack does n't cause them to cease to exist entirely well connelly actually does coke i think but it fails to liven her up any also i actually the bergman films i 've seen so that 's not really a fair comparison they love each other apparently but since i do n't even like either of them i 'm not much interested finally burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end perhaps it would n't have been funny if i cared about her but we 've been over that and i want you people to know that i 'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies i can care about the characters but none of these people did anything for me so the movie 's dead in the water for good counter examples watch trainspotting '' which has characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and bubba '' a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it on the other hand neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as requiem for a dream '' so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego still if that 's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose requiem for a dream '' is n't helped any by darren aronofsky 's repetitive derivative the trouble is this movie has n't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is there 's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics but they 're hopelessly driven in to the ground as we see a thousand times montages a million times and plenty of wonky junk and they are again impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ai n't drawing me in i imagine that the overdone repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use but that does n't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over truth be told i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half but then it really started to grate on me it became evident that no aronofsky was n't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no these characters were n't going to get any more interesting i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective it was kind of uplifting really now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else now that 's a good ending grade ps this is 500 reviews i doubt if i will write 500 more but who knows ||| 0

the only reason why i saw this was because of susannah york this shows she was more capable of the dix she played in the killing of sister george '' and was a fine actress otherwise this movie is blah it 's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting the men in this movie are so disgusting one ca n't blame her for getting mad anyway for another pointless film of this caliber see secret ceremony ||| 0

you want realism of the old west try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they did n't have tissues try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black that would be realistic but it 's a lot more repellant to television audiences than gratuitous profanity so this realistic '' show has characters with clean fluffy hair and pretty teeth spew garbage langauge constantly and sucker viewers and reviewers buy this as realistic '' ! ! ! every great writer of every age and era be it mark twain owen wister william shakespeare or john steinbeck or any other storyteller whose works have survived for generations told realistic '' stories of their era but who understood what realistic trivia to keep in and what to leave out in order to tell the story that is why their work has remained timeless deadwood 's writing shows a huge insecurity complex in choosing to rely on a gimmick and a juvenile one at that like profanity whether or not the calamity janes of the time actually used the words ignorant '' is something we will never know and is also absolutely irrelevant there are an awful lot of sheeple in tv land ||| 0
ok the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous ! ! the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ! peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics ||| 0

okay the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen but i like the actors especially ben 's best man so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones or at least why do n't they use them oh no much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor '' charade was so predictable oh gee he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and holmes '' might have to step up and uh they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gon na get busted what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending it was obviously supposed to be a surprise and it was but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience i felt cheated i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah 's little boy and all that i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they 're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen right up to the last moment we think he 's breaking it off with bridget instead what the heck let 's just go ahead and get married after all huh he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane ! ! ! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back this man obviously does n't have a clue what he wants in life and i 'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after not only that but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us do n't do it ! '' and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway it 's just marriage it 's romantic ! you could get lucky and live happily ever after ! it 's been my experience when things are n't feeling just right as you approach that wedding turn and run the last thing you should do is close your eyes grab your balls and take the leap ||| 0
simply put the movie is boring upon is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural '' response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend '' and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie save your money save your time choose another movie ||| 0
i rented this dvd because of the glowing reviews here and because i wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the middle east overall i was disappointed by this offering because it did n't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject it also seems to me to be biased in israel 's favor the palestinians but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately for instance the documentary jumps right into the last zionist congress in 1939 or whenever it was but they never define what the zionist movement is or where it came from i know some of this from my reading but it would be nice to have a summary here especially as it relates to the main players in the rest of the documentary i wish the documentary would have at least started with wwi and the british occupation of palestine after the fall of the ottoman empire rather than picking up at wwii and mentioning some of the wwi details later doing so would have answered questions like why are the british so important here '' another example is keeping track of the people places and organizations which are often named in hebrew or arabic and are unfamiliar to the uninitiated it made the sequence of events hard to follow because we had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what and where using more text on the screen more maps more recaps and perhaps more english translations would have improved things greatly methinks the film certainly has value not least because it is told by a participant and observer but it is not for those without much familiarity with the people places and issues at hand ||| 0

ok i 've only just seen this film for the first time so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect but this is not a particularly good film i mean it has its choice moments where it really comes together the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed any scene with is almost guaranteed classic status samuel jackson 's in it and if you 're a fan of dave chapelle 's tyrone biggums crackhead character the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his similarity but that 's really my problem with this film serious issues are reduced to a series of archetypes straight out of central casting and they 're all here the homey black grandparents the nation of islam convert the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine 's road all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth take the french film 'la haine ' for instance it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society boyz n tha hood but its characters actually feel tormented instead of just having lots of scenes written for them to show their torment rather than just running through a laundry list of problems it really gets to the heart of something bigger some grander alienation that urban youths feel which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do plus if you can believe it the in 'la haine ' is quite a bit better so while i would definitely recommend seeing this film keep the remote aimed and ready finger on the button maybe about a of this film is really worth watching whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising oh yeah and there 's a really sex scene thrown in for no particular reason oh also the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees in a film that did n't try to carry so much social weight that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking but it really just cheapens this one ||| 0
these plays were okay i 'm glad i rented them before buying them the props and things were very nice the actors did n't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre definitely no tyler perry quality on that note but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out i thought alexander o'neal sang in one of them but he didn't ||| 0
in good company '' goes on and on at the end a little bit and the ending especially is not fulfilling if it had ended minutes before it actually did i would give it three stars instead of two i admit there were quite a few times when i laughed a bit to myself but it did n't make me fall off the couch or anything there were other times when i thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced overall it is n't an entirely bad movie but like i said the ending is unfulfilling overall not strong performances coming from scarlett johansson or topher grace ||| 0

the entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or it is actually completely false the concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with whom is murdered or is otherwise the victim but what you did in distinct criminal incidents even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone if you go back and murder them again '' then that is a new incident and double jeopardy does not apply in movies intended to be fantastic diverging this much from reality might be but this is a mainstream legal thriller it 's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women do n't for no apparent reason but the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means or they just accurately banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is ||| 0
this show deserved to get cancelled and there 's a very simple reason this is supposedly dry subtle comedy for people who do n't usually like dry subtle comedy it 's a show that was presented to the fox audience an audeince that normally likes the most inane kind of humor that does n't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it meanwhile to people who actually appreciate subtlety and dry humor the comedy in the show is unbelievably obvious and predictable every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke it 's clear how forced and contrived it is how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor something they clearly do n't understand it 's embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat it 's just an awkward mess but those are n't the people this show is targeted at it 's targeted at that fox audience who has never even seen dry humor before and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them they think this show is brilliant because it 's a little smarter than mad tv or at least thinks it is and since those are the people who are seeing the show you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is if the show were on hbo or some other network exposed to a different kind of audience you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works so why did this show get cancelled when so many people think it 's so amazing if it 's so great people would have actually watched it right so where were the ratings the fact is the people who love this show are a very vocal minority the audience for dry humor did n't watch this show because it 's not funny but the audience who was fooled by this show as vocal as they are was just too small they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it this is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for tv as its apologists claim no it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes ||| 0
four brothers '' is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career the director who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty boyz n the hood '' has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again the story reeking of artificiality features mark wahlberg tyrese gibson andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother when she is killed in a convenience store robbery the quartet launches into action seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced through their investigation in the neighborhood that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a film student we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith rendering the boys ' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best the acting is uniformly flat with the characters little more than stereotypes and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and given the singleton pedigree in this area the boys ' running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother 's killer is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque with nary a single moment that rings believable or true four brothers '' is filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more ||| 0

personally i found this workout extremely difficult to follow the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood after pushing myself to go back to every part i did n't understand i grew frustrated other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition as i have obviously tried but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill both of which i believe are integral to any workout and in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output one should n't have to teach themselves the moves to a less significant degree i agree with the reviews that comment on the cheesiness '' of the video at first such cheesiness made me laugh and then as i grew frustrated it merely made me further annoyed what i feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor marie forleo 's unsuccessful motivation attempts which are not only redundant but suggestive in a most unnecessary way i do n't mean to sound so aggressively negative i just wish i had been able to learn the moves because they did look like fun ||| 0

denise austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults this video is n't kid friendly and does n't have a good feel for kids to be honest it is very close to most of denise 's exercise videos for adults what denise has forgotten or may have never known is kids are kids and they need to be treated accordingly and that means with exercise videos to a good choice for kids is kick to get fit kids this video is done by a qualified kid 's fitness professional not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids and just hoping they can do them my kids are not at all happy with this program there are 6 10 years old and they were bored turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes mostly because they did n't understand the movements and then found most of the other movements very hard to do once again the forgotten point kids are kids and they need to be treated accordingly one last point in the video denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children 's exercise fitness this is all good except they all forgot one very important detail you must be able to teach instruct children at a level they understand just because you know something about exercise it does n't mean you are able to teach it to children knowledge is one thing teaching instructing is another and the fact is some people are just not very good at instructing children a point that is very clearly displayed within this program ||| 0
sixth sense unbreakable are so much better than signs and i 'm sorry to say whatever night shyamalan originally had he 's lost when sixth sense came out he was tipped as the next big thing but i 'm sorry to say it 's no longer there in my mind he can not match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of sixth sense signs just fails miserably the concept was a good idea but the execution was terrible it reminded me very much of blair witch project as in what little action there was happens off screen and the torches as well it 's also definitely not mel gibson 's best film even the actors appear to struggle with the script and not really much happens apart from one brief glimpse of an alien oooh fascinating the problem i think that signs has is that it 's already following many other far superior alien movies aliens attacking the earth has been done and lots more memorable than this there 's also the overly religious theme which the film probably would have done better either toning down or scrapping altogether it was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film the scenes between gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy the finale does n't really make the film better the discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious ! why come to earth the surface of is mostly covered in water and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour ! and then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology and then ca n't break into a wooden house ! are you kidding me but the most ridiculous thing is not only do the characters not pay attention to the dogs who sensed something was not right time to get myself a dog but the fact that all the sophisticated radar equipment can not detect the aliens entering our atmosphere but a baby monitor can ! huh ! a film to stay well away from thankfully i did n't spend my hard earned ha ! money on it but borrowed it from a friend i shall approach night shyamalan 's films with trepidation from now oh and when a director decides to give himself a speaking role in his own film make it a short one ||| 0

i saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there ! since i was bored i found myself looking at other people there to see if i could get a read on what they were thinking and after it was over i asked my friend what he thought he said oh it was okay '' but did n't elaborate so let me it was painfully unfunny with jokes or punchlines that fell flat horrible acting totally predictable and very forgetable this is a movie you might want to rent only if you 're really bored and nearly every other movie is out and even then you 'd be better off to go home empty handed there 's not even much eye candy to recommend which is a nice fallback if there 's nothing else going for it how people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling just because you like a movie should n't mean you give it 5 stars especially when it 's as bad as this one i mean i liked freddy vs jason but there 's no way i 'd give that movie 4 or 5 stars this is bottom of the barrel ||| 0
as an environmental scientist i find these political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful while they rally the convinced having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful to wit about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage about the movie '' it 's actually a filmation of the presentation al gore has made for some time on global warming in it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of and other gasses the audience is bombarded with a long series of charts graphs and suppositions that make for a compelling argument if one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation and this is where this production goes terribly wrong the fact checking was terrible the data was obvious and and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause two examples an inconvenient truth asserts that a rise of 20 feet is a realistic prospect yet the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the western nations warns of rise in the four to 35 inches range in the century gore discusses the earth 's atmosphere as relatively thin and declares that the problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide '' hello thickness has nothing to do with global warming people carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from earth 's surface meaning that the vibration warms the which makes things hotter further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense since it does n't play a role my warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process no matter how noble the cause may be ||| 0

the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great i 'll try and remember that next time the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward you 'll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it happy viewing ||| 0
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing i was right i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it recently i was offered the chance to watch it again i thought ok i did n't see the whole thing it might have gotten better so i 'll give it another chance '' bad mistake this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long hidalgo is the name of the horse so what that 's about as boring as this movie so why the markup cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the and i do like viggo i did not however like this movie it 's kind of fitting it should be set in a cause that 's exactly where this movie should be buried never to bore another wave of audiences again if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap watch hidalgo you 'll be out in no time ||| 0

it is hard to believe that the same team that made gettysburg made this verbose waste of time this movie almost guarantees that the last full measure will never be filmed and that is a shame it was a mistake to take stephen lang and put him in the role of jackson jackson was considered even by his contemporaries a military genius but crazy by half the film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be shakespearean the prayer scene in the morning puke ! it could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene most of the women '' folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded and i hate to say it but i was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever i was glad to be rid of her her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor i get it jackson was such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual '' give me a break i hate being force feed like that a better director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly then there is chamberlain quoting shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares there is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film i would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been a narrative like gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige if you must see it borrow it rent it but do n't waste money buying it unless it is in the 3 bin at the local dirtmart gettysburg is much better i actually missed sheen and i hate that guy ||| 0
susan ward coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with as the lack of film sets show if you like susan ward then give this a movie a try if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future don '' t find it here ||| 0
i was really looking forward to this i 've seen cheap trick live and they really put on a good show i do n't know how some of the other reviewers can give this 5 stars for audio it is like listening to a concert in an empty warehouse muffled audio and underpowered vocals i have a 5.1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert dvd that i 've ever heard i 'm giving it 2 stars because i think it was a good show to see live if you were there but the audio quality or lack of it ruined it for me ||| 0
let me start off by saying that i have higher degrees in art art history music and romance languages so i am an admitted art snob '' having said that i would recommend that you try the baby einstein baby van gogh world of colors '' and baby mozart '' videos instead of this brainy baby video i find this brainy baby video to be slow boring insipid condescending and visually uninteresting i can not wait to put in something else wait you say is n't this about the baby who is watching it well i first realized that it is truly boring and not just me '' by watching my 's reaction to it she is now 10 months old and still does not like it she consistently snubbed her nose at this video she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do she has never had this reaction to the einstein videos i mentioned i tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better but after 4 months of this approach she still is not interested however the einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning and still do here are the specifics that i think are the problem the visuals are weak and not enough my daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys the female is distracting and annoying rather than engaging and instructional as intended the flow is not as coherent as the einstein videos which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video there is no charm or sense of humor like the einstein videos no i do not have any connection whatsoever to the baby einstein folks i 'm just saying that the brainy baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging if you 're going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together ||| 0

my friend bought this set and so i was able to view it before purchasing it myself and i wo n't be purchasing it i had seen the long long trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies i have ever seen one of those films where you ca n't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do we enjoy most of the i love lucy series but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows the aggrivating ones and this film was just an overly long aggrivating i love lucy episode there is funny humor and aggrivating humor '' and this was definitely the type yes it was interesting to see lucy and desi doing films together but overall these films are just tolerable and none are ones i would rewatch for enjoyment too many girls was definitely a b picture really really bad in so many ways poorly written script cheap scenery you never got the feeling they were in college except at the football game which seemed so similar to the football game the marx brothers participated in in horse feathers ! too much partying singing dancing what was this school majoring in theatre and opera it just is a really bad picture yes neat to see lucy and desi and how they met and see them so young together but otherwise a real time waster in my mind the funniest thing on this disc was the cartoon extra ! of the three forever darling is probably the best but again that seemed lacking '' somewhere the color was that beautiful almost surreal 50 's color that i like the yosemite scenery was beautiful too but i think the angel stuff could have been much better developed he was out of the scene too long at times the part i liked best was lucy imagining herself in the movie with james mason because it was quite funny but the camping trip was just a very predictable mishap time that was too much in the i love lucy mold and i was bored with it quickly i know die hard fans of lucy and desi will buy this no matter what and that 's fine but for others i advise you see them first you may like them but then you may see them for what they really are cinematically there are lots better movies out there that i would rather buy ! i rate these 2 stars one star to me is torturous '' to watch these are n't that bad but almost ||| 0
i saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl i was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too to this day i pray i do n't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average again as a who has worked hard to take the right road in life i was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic do we really need to come out with a movie for all of america to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race prison sex babies drinking beer young kids doing a drive by mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa please ! ! ! ! wake up ! we need some positivity ! ! ! ! ! edward james olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message what message that doing the things shown in this movie are bad i think we knew that already ! what surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on amazon that this movie got this of course means that no matter how much sense i have made it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful us not forget that i am not the only one who thinks negative about this film several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual s out there who found the movie offensive edward james olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie adios amigos ! ! ! ||| 0

maybe it 's just me but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie it 's an incredibly small production 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest either and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie if you are an alan rickman fan chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these do n't let the promise of a nude scene '' convince you to buy this movie honestly alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very film and the dialogue is not enough to carry it off ||| 0
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was too much blood killing and the like it was totally historically inaccurate and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his yet he does not even load either time and somehow without even aiming the canon he knocks his 'friend ' off his horse the movie is a failure crappy junky just plain dumb stupid pathetic i am not going to waste any more words on it just you do your money do n't buy it it 's not worth 50 cents ||| 0
okay it 's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion it does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis on the other hand the film lacks true suspense i was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn the baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum the pacing is too slow at times and it just does n't stand up that well today the actors who took part in this did n't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel why there was a sequel is beyond me i recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but i was only five at the time at the most this is a rent not a buy i guess good for it 's time but perhaps a would pump some needed life into the story ||| 0
this 's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover '' and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it 's resolved in much too pat a fashion however leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around and there 's a torture scene modeled on the one in lethal weapon '' in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks thomas ' performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell ||| 0

and that is boring and snobish ! i watched the first two hours of this and coud n't keep awake the narritor 's voice was monotone i wanted to shout at his pompous snobish demeanor shut up ! ! in my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god 's peoples with the narritor granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko when you take people on a educating journey such as nine hours long invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home i felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like i was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours i am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this dvd set back to the library and saying check please '' ||| 0

i 've been waiting for this season literally for years it contained notice the past tense the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show it was in the emergency clinic in the episode my sister my sitter '' where the scene pans around showing the patients smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down when i first saw that many years ago i literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like i needed a padded room she did n't even understand the joke when i explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of hiding '' the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable this dvd cut has been cut and makes smithers reply about not letting lisa ahead of him make no sense one of my favorite things about the simpsons was that they did n't care who they offended well they went pc and now i 'm highly offended ! if they had n't messed with it i would give them 5 stars or more realistically i would n't have bothered to write this review quit tampering with the show fox ! ! ||| 0

rather than give another general review as others have kindly done my review focuses on one aspect of the film indeed one character that of martha martha dunstock is known throughout the film as martha dumptruck even the film credits include the nickname ' besides the character 's surname evidently feeling the need to labour the point portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given she unwittingly provides the slater character with information enabling him to murder a student later when the cult status of the ' that is murdered students becomes apparent martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic but her attempt is shown as a failure at the end of the film martha is bruised and now disabled in an electric wheelchair ryder 's character having finished her voyage of rejects the school prom night and instead invites martha to stay in with a video and popcorn martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show ryder walking along the corridor while martha encircles her like a planet around the sun the image of martha in her wheelchair an object of pity for ryder and for the audience signifies to us fears of being different of not being beautiful of not being loved and respected martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming she is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker and though some of us in the audience may be fat or disabled or both we may yet still fear martha and are invited to consider ryder 's protagonist 's journey of self discovery as our own even is in physical and social reality we are more like martha for this reason ' fails as an exploration of the ' of high school a description often used by firefly 's joss whedon those in the audience not as thin and complying with western standards of ' as the protagonists probably the majority of us ultimately may find the subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow leaving a bitter the way ' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers sadly this is happening even today in some ways it has gotten even worse since the western world decided to wage a 'war on fat ' to quote paul campos and even at best it is lazy ||| 0

how high is a film that lends nothing i repeat nothing to the film community at large i have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the cheech chong of the new millennium with the man pairing while most seem to agree that this is a horrible film very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be when i use the word racist i mean that it builds upon the degenerate that african americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society while there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing method man and redman must be to both the film community but also to their own culture i have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films but this one left my jaw on the floor several times the blatant swings at african american stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director jesse dylan but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film nothing was original nothing was exciting was the pairing of redman and method man an idea of comedic proportions i think not as you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought why method man and redman who completely different people were nothing more than the same character in this film with the very subtle hints of method man being smarter nothing could separate the equality of these two characters that is why they failed as a comic team think of matthau and lemmon or the above example of cheech chong what made these teams work while the how high team crashed and burned what worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together but with method man and redman they were the same i was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film what tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive what dylan did to counter the similarity between man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters the jock the frat boy the asian which was again another racist moment and the rich white boy just felt and were old watch college films from the and you will see these same combinations but what makes the films from the different is that they used them with originality how high from beginning to end was anything but original i must admit after watching this film of which harvard was willing to loan their name to i do n't want to go to harvard they should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage how high is a dark spot in harvard 's history do you know what makes it even worse this film was n't even created at or anywhere near harvard again dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film how high has no redeeming qualities ooops i stand corrected the only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when spalding gray spoke how did they get him and fred willard to do this film i have said it once i will say it again some actors just need their bills paid inconsistency incompetence and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud what destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general it is nothing there is no original story at all with how high going to college working for your grades winning over the heart of the president right at the last minute this was nothing short of a cut and paste '' film that had no backbone and horrid acting ! i do not like jesse dylan 's style of directing while i think kicking and screaming is his prized film due greatly to will ferrell all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes the john adams scene in how high is a prime example the benjamin franklin moments is another the unconcluded truth serum '' can be considered another how high was just scene after scene of inconsistency lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated ! i blame a majority of the issues with this film on jesse dylan if he would have tightened the script created unique and '' characters and eliminated the racism he may have had the quintessential weed '' film in hollywood now all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for sad overall this was one of the worst films that i have witnessed never have i been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as i have with how high the actors all around were horrible the story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age this film would never be considered a comedy nothing was funny nothing will make you laugh the only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits the ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life grade out of ||| 0
i 'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia i had not seen this movie as a child those that say it 's faithful to the book must have read something other than lewis carroll 's alice however the kitsch value is considerable cheezy music and costumes pure 1985. that being said the jabberwock was pretty cool in that '' sort of way also the set design was very handsome it 's too bad that the lighting technology of the time could n't have been more varied everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional the film that comes closest to tenniel 's original alice illustrations is the 1933 paramount b w version it 's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on turner classics ||| 0
just like hollywood and just like the music industry which i guess is the point john travolta playing on his character from get shorty and to a lesser degree like his character in pulp fiction and swordfish is cool this time he 's trying to make it big in the music biz he discovers a new talent artist christina milian and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters a brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar the dialogue seems forced funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae aside from a few interesting moments only one speech toward the end made by cedric the entertainer redeemed the film it 's like a big commercial which i suppose is any hollywood film certain musicians get shameless plugs steven tyler and aerosmith included in the film various movies get shameless plugs including in a not so disguised fashion get shorty certain hollywood landmarks the mann chinese theater are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the lakers and the staples center get a plug it 's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or in this case making a musician so we watch travolta as cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give christina milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts the ending is so horribly cheesy i felt as if i was watching american idol watchable but barely the player covered this terrain so much better ||| 0
thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie besides this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it as usual uma 's acting is simply dreadful i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad how she became a star '' in hollywood is beyond me she is not attractive nor can she act she could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit i think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles they call her john travolta is not much better his version of cool '' just does n't do it for me his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta 's scenes i tended to rewind during rock 's and vaughn 's scenes they were so funny i had to see them again cedric the entertainer was also pretty good ||| 0
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information and to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond we are truly in trouble the truth is out there and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd but this dvd is maybe worth a glance but not a long hard look ||| 0

well you know the drill some people will like anything that is artsy '' or out of the ordinary '' or made by that great director '' its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless the movie is about incest it is about sex and adolescence and ironically it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews the best part of this movie is eva green or more precisely eva green 's body i did n't care about her acting i thought it was mediocre i just sat there and drunk her body in wishing that i was that lucky actor whats his name again the only reason to watch this movie is eva green if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation then i am glad it happened the movie is visually rich in fact its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see but i will take it he captures and celebrates eve green 's stunning body every square millimeter of it including her genitals the movie is for a reason to perfection other than that there is nothing else in the movie the story is utterly insipid the old movie clips the discussion '' of morality or whatever nothing interesting the music is another plus point bottomline watch it for eva green 's body it deserves five stars but the movie deserves only two ||| 0
having been a teenager once i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience however in pump up the volume the movie 's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior even our hero well played by christian slater can not communicate with people on a one to one level he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them as a proponent of truth he is a vapid antithesis of truth he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths he does n't use his real name or voice and on a call with a potential suicide victim he treats the caller as someone who is n't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure but is n't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes sorry folks been there done that living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right questioning authority without any viable alternatives as none of these teens do merely escalates the generational gap and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth ||| 0
roger ebert a review i greatly respect and normally agree with raved about this flick roger i love you but you missed the boat on this one i 'm not going to review the plot because it 's been done by several reviewers already suffice it to say david lynch did n't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman english okay class who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig 's head on page 72 in lord of the flies david how about you '' and now want to inflict it on you the unwitting movie watching public thanks lynch but i 'll pass i did n't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of crime and punishment and i did n't enjoy it in scene after scene of mulholland drive to add insult to injury lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense rationalizing it by saying life often does n't make sense this habit of his is less noticible in this film than say twin peaks mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless yeah it 's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life but more along the lines of i would 've won powerball this week except i spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the renfaire what the heck was i thinking '' or i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie what the heck was i thinking '' but i 've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf i must live a sheltered life or something lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his dvd believing his movie must be watched in its entirety or not at all i 'd advise the second to be fair in this case i do n't think he 's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance but rather by the knowledge that every male if given the chance would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action c'mon all you 5 star givers admit it ! you find the movie pretentious and silly but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy ! to reiterate if i wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence i 'll rewatch dallas if i wanted to see a nice rack i 'll take my top off and look in the mirror who needs mulholland drive ||| 0
this picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick a rather pointless attempt to remake brewster 's millions with an altuistic slant it was n't a bad '' movie it simply was n't a good '' one boooooooring ||| 0
this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives it portrays reality how they want to see it its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo ||| 0
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of ||| 0
i never saw this movie until i was 16. the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments well so did fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason ! everyone burn your copies now ||| 0

i do n't know how this skunk got 4 and stars on amazon let alone one ! i could hear hepburn bogart and holden rolling over with a resounding boom i think this is mainly because of ford 's linus he is a very unsympathetic character in this remake the film critics said that while the original sabrina was about her transformation this version was about linus ' transformation but here linus shows no transformation that you can really see his explanation to sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the there was a merger and you were in the way no hard feelings '' is very cold compared with bogart 's would you believe i enjoyed every minute of it '' in the original you get the feeling that sabrina gets the right man you do n't get that here at all ||| 0
for what purpose these lies about the life of this man are the liberal film makers racists who do n't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest hurricane carter is not and was not that man facts in the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell they want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times ! in a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved fact giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape the depitction is another lie another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder fact is that carter 's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights as carter 's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people while in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america shame norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood did n't care they just like the message looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet america bashing and race baiting is alive and well earning oscars and making for big box office a shame ||| 0
not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes it 's tantamount to watching old batman episodes as soon as something develops in comes the cheesy music the added scenes were poorly produced which is why they did n't make the original cut the interviews seemed contrived i 'm not impressed the older version supersedes the new ||| 0
the movie is one of my favorites works on both a romantic level and a comic level but where 's the widescreen todays consumers are more educated thank god and they 've almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen you lose the top and bottom of the movie ! '' they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd it is for all intents and purposes incomplete '' who 's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible ||| 0
this movie was obviously made by japanese fans of several american films it then tried to mix them all together in one film the main ones are the matrix reservoir dogs and night of the living dead especially the matrix we have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life then it is a genre gore film heavy with feuding yakuza elements our main character has the long black matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor the 360 camera movements of the matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the aspect instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action i really hated the matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the matrix already has a big strike against it as for the other elements they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite american movies that they wanted to include the gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting note that if you are looking for something different than typical american movies by checking out those wacky japanese movies you will not get it here ||| 0
hart 's war had potential the last months of world war two as a backdrop with demoralized gi 's crammed into an overcrowded pow compound if this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the battle of the bulge then it could have had a chance instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots unintentionally the movie borrows from slaughterhouse five a soldier 's story the great escape and stalag 17. a cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple in hart 's war we find some good elements lost in a virtual mulligan stew in the story colin farrell 's character a rear echelon lawyer accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride unfortunately for farrell the germans have launched their attack in the ardennes the young lawyer is captured harshly interrogated and finally shipped out to a german stalag there he meets the senior pow officer played by bruce willis and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a pow a soldier is killed and a recently downed tuskegee airman is accused of murder yes you guessed it farrell takes on the aviator 's defense during the subsequent courts martial if director gregory hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged instead we have additions of colonel hart 's unexplained behavior an mass tunnel escape plot sabotage and the german commandant 's attempt to befriend the american lawyer as superfluous baggage hart 's war was filmed in the czech republic no doubt to cut costs a little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office still if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this dvd to your collection ||| 0
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny not scary and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even '' absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! ! ||| 0
i can not believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we 've seen in films like baby boy '' almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word he did n't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance i do n't know what this film was about there are parts where there is a long silence with no talking the whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house there are a few scenes where the characters are running around without any obvious aim the film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying what was all that excitement about '' ||| 0
how anyone could rate this movie stars is beyond belief this was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere as i watched this movie i could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama it was never very funny and both lead actors playing one white and one adopted black brother had scenes in the movie that were terrible romany malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body he jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them in his drawers he is talentless and idiotic as a brother '' in france that no one can relate to paul rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and grossly '' tells off everyone people he has known for less than a week ! the servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well but ca n't make up for the dismal rest ludicrous a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama this is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints ||| 0
the movie dead life '' by director william victor shotten is a throwback to the great movies of old such as night of the living dead or at least it tries to be unfortunately it 's a stupid attempt and being original through looking old which in itself is an irony looking at its writing there 's absolutely nothing to commend this movie on though this movie at least tries to give you an explanation as to the existence of zombies it 's as as a cat 's decision to chase a shiny object the common mistake made with romero 's films is that the story was n't well thought out since they never really explain the zombies except a bit in the original about a meteor however what people do n't realize is it does n't matter why romero 's films are satirical in nature they focus on a larger picture and disregard details that 's what makes them so great that 's what makes them films dead life makes some attempt and showing depth with its underlying theme except it 's stupid and unoriginal and really not shocking or in the slightest this movie is not shocking it 's not realistic even the gore scene '' everyone is referring to is only a stupid attempt at being shocking and but it comes off as just being tasteless people are giving this movie credit for having no money but really people have done better with less the acting is ridiculous the sound is poorly dubbed the camera is always out of focus and the special effects are lame it is a tasteless zombie romp with no point whatsoever it does n't deserve credit for having a low budget it makes no effort to make people think and makes no effort to be good period night of the living dead was a film this is not even close to reaching that level oh and it actually takes sound effects straight from the first resident evil game and dubs them in seriously ||| 0
okay i admit they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends heres my problem they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera most of the scenes were blurry every now and again the focus was clear i mean c'mon when i was fourteen i made a short stop motion animation film using an old bell and howell super 8 cam and even then i paid attention to the enough of that now for the pros of the film the fx were good and there is one scene that will make most men wince the outdoor and some indoor settings had a notld feel overall i recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds at least you can say you saw it rent if you can if not buy used ||| 0
for years i 've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for horror movies but i 'd rather watch anything shot on video than watching the waste of film that is dead life do n't be fooled when i say this movie is shot on film it seriously looks like it was shot on a camera it 's perpetually grainy dark fuzzy and shaky and not in an artsy way my 200 video camera looks infinitely better than this the video quality is appropriate however as it 's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this the sound is murky and undecipherable the acting is strictly amateur hour the characters are with no distinction or purpose the story is the dialogue is a completely worthless bore there 's nothing remotely scary and the special effects including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a commodore 64 are laughable or at least i wish they were laughable that would 've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this high school student film it 's movies like this cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy but which get cherry spots on blockbuster shelves because they 're packaged with slick cover art that give horror movies in general and zombie movies in particular a bad name and that make horror fans so wary disgraceful ! ||| 0
unfocused repetitive and worst of all boring ! what should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame ronnie earle the district attorney at the center of the film says this is n't about democrats and republicans this is about cops and robbers '' if only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say instead from the start the big buy feels like a film you 've walked into thirty minutes late following the theme stated by earle of cops and robbers the big buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely wo n't notice somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story to bad it 's not being told here ||| 0
with the exception of disc 6 this collection was very disappointing it was obvious that the show lost its charm after season 3 and was well on its way out before paul reubens little incident however if you liked herman the first collection under playhouse 1 is excellent it was fresh and innovative my 3 year old loves the first 6 discs disc 7 to disc 10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase they should have included disc 6 with the first set anything after that was simply not entertaining the quality of all the discs still is excellent ||| 0
leeches is a terrible movie dude i have never seen anything so gay in my whole life except the director 's other film speed demon when the guys were less clothes than the gals thats not a good sign the video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director 's work they 're all filled with loads of homoeroticism women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks the 'roided up leeches enter their male '' victims through anal orrifices after watching about a half hour of this mess i had to turn it off why does this guy fool people into renting these movies i do n't mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it 's time to draw the line no hetro relationships in this one just the director molesting his male stars with his camera horrible stuff stay away from david decoteau 's work and his fifty different aliases unless you know what you 're in for ||| 0
the '' has got to be one of the most overrated overhyped shows that i have ever seen this side of friends '' this show makes me ashamed to be from is nothing appealing or compelling about a bunch of rich spoiled suburban white teens sorry i mean year old acters playing teenagers and their so called problems '' admit i tried to give this show a chance i tried to watch a few episodes and really i could n't make it passed the half an hour mark turning it to adult swim or some nick at night '' or something and speaking of white is '' suppose to stand for orange county '' or only caucasians '' i had no idea that their were no black mexican or asian people that lived in the '' peter gallagher 's character is suppose to be the bad guy '' huh please ! how about i snatch this chump off the '' streets toss him in a trunk and take him to long beach compton crenshaw or watts and then lets see how bad '' a guy he is then the bottom line is i ca n't stand this gay fake show and i ca n't stand all you losers that praise it even more ! and by the way this show do n't even belong in the same zip code as 90210 ! now put that in yo pipes and smoke it ! ||| 0
i expected alot more from richard harris he was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of abraham also there was n't enough vocal input from god expecially since his promises to abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant there were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible i was somewhat annoyed that the movie had god saying that sarai 's name means princess and that he would change it to sarah which means queen this is not true ! ! in hebrew sarah means princess such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability ||| 0
in dr yang 's dvd i expected to find a good reference for my practice of the yang 108 form but i am very displeased with the quality of the dvd for the price that i paid i expected a least good video quality when yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor there are close ups of the upper body and obviously the movement of the legs is not seen you get lost with changes of camera angles at some point you can see people in the background and the stage is not properly set up also and with all due respect his movements are weird i have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed definitively i do not recommend this dvd to any one who wants to use it as a reference you can use it as a movie ||| 0
i have been a radiohead fan and like many others have been waiting patiently for a live dvd so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old ! i could n't help being disappointed when i watched this dvd the constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch in fact i only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust i know i would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime i 've always that radiohead was modern progressive and totally innovative i appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey and it does n't help that before every song thom mutters this is a new one '' ||| 0
the original candyman '' sucks so bad but everybody praises it and i kept wondering to myself am i missing something '' so i tried watching it again and it still sucked as i could not even get through it so i figured maybe i should watch the sequels and maybe i would find something that i liked about this series well after watching candyman 2 '' one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish again the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme the villain in candyman '' makes me want to laugh because he is so not scary if you want a good laugh watch the candyman '' series but if you want to be scared you would even do better to watch ren and stimpy '' in all seriousness watch halloween '' and halloween ii '' if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and does n't try to send a social message lol some people call candyman farewell to the flesh '' a horror movie i just call it rubbish ||| 0
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one ||| 0
my son loves airplanes and jets ! i bought this dvd based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video if you want a dvd that shows flying do not buy this dvd ! the name of the video should be watch the blue angles get ready to fly '' because that is what this video is in the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying then the next 25 minutes is no flying just talking and showing the blue angles getting ready for their show in the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show my son has never made it to that point he wants to see fly and i 'm now on a new search for a dvd that will do this for him ||| 0
kings and queen '' is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and minutes to no discernible point or purpose the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live the other story involves a young man named ismael a violinist who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora 's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining kings and queen '' might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching but taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really do n't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over for instance nora 's father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughter 's character that simply does n't gibe with the woman we 've been looking at for well over two hours nora is admittedly no mother theresa then again who is but she certainly does n't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place i do n't think so perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here this is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning ||| 0
1. make sure you set your film in some sort of terrible alternate future where all people are slaves or unhappy or kept under sedation or something 2. have every scene take place in the dark and your underworld must be lit by bulbs 3. clothe everyone in black leather particularly capes this especially works for the villains but in the interest of equal play the heroes can be edgy and wear black leather too if they 're villains shave their heads give them sunglasses for the dark ! 4. copying terry gilliam 's masterpiece brazil throw something retro like brimmed fedoras into the wardrobe 5. have a premise where our hero a lone guy wakes up or somehow finds himself in a world he does not remember getting into he must clear his name of something even if it 's just getting off pottery barn 's mailing list 6. have a mysterious woman who may or may not be in cohoots with the bad guys but who falls in love with our hero and wants to save him by the end of act ii 7. make damn sure she 's sultry though blondes are generally more popular these days in hollywood here dark brunettes work best 8. have lots of issues that revolve around our brains being dicked with throw in lots of tortured dialogue about alternative substitutes 9. this is very important use the rhetorical line at least once do you know what will happen if you find the kiber to rescue your on a bright light '' indeed he and we do n't this is supposed to get us all scared and anxious 10. our hero should have had if possible a happy childhood that turned tragic slaughtered parents work great here of course he does n't remember any of it at least at first 11. populate your world with lots of machines with tubes wires cables and ducts there also should be flashes of lightning that serve no purpose 12. make sure your sets and costumes were derived '' from some black and white classic film from the or metropolis caligari even frankenstein will do nicely this is both to show you have a legitimate pedigree '' and to cover up the fact that you have no original ideas yourself 13. make sure all the bad guys bite off their dialogue and sound mean this is how we know they are bad guys since lately both sides have been wearing black leather 14. the guy gets the girl in the end and the sun comes out really now do we have to say this however through most of the movie we must believe the love will be unrequited the dame should have a troubled history though you must keep it vague 15. throw in some cyborgs you got ta have cyborgs 16. have sets that are about fifteen times larger than they need to be but which are largely empty 17. there 's always the authority figure who starts out in pursuit of our guy but who by the end becomes convinced of his innocence and moves to his side 18. there was some vague recent apocalyptic event that destroyed most of civilization but be brief here our audience may get to wondering how one guy saving one girl will restore all of civilization and you do n't want them thinking about that 19. include a sadomasochistic scene or two the current favorite is to strap the victim on a rotating mechanical device and stick him with needles this movie likes to stick them through the bone at the front of the skull a really stupid place to insert a needle but then this screenwriter clearly is n't a brain surgeon 20. always have a big climax with lots of explosions steam smoke distorting of the picture with computer tricks and loud rock music this is how we resolve things when we have no idea what the hell we 're talking about or how to end the movie we hope nobody notices generally they do n't follow this primer and whatever you come up with will be called bold and visionary by people whose filmgoing history does n't extend before 1995 and roger i do n't wan na become critically irrelevant '' ebert ||| 0
well i went to the concert and the whole time while i was watching it i was glade they where coming out with a dvd because dvd can hold lots and lots and lots of information and why would they cheap out and not put every artist with every song on here why i would be 100 i do n't care i want to see it all and well i waited months and months wondering waiting for it to come out i went there with 3 other friends and it was the thing of a life time then it was time the p t dvd of the century thank you emi for destroying a historial document so you can get all your signed contracts on to your dvd well now all i have to do is use my time machine and get a tape ready and tape the damn concert wait time machines doe n't exist well now i am going ot have to go underground to get it but wait i still 100 will emi release all the videos on dvd or do we have to go underground to get it from someone who tapped it and is selling it all i can say this is why the internet was invented for information exchange if they keep information paticularly this historical document from people they will share it over the internet the video does n't belong to 1 company it belongs to the world the world created this and who does emi think they are by limiting this i am so sick and tired of this utter b t no one should settle for this i demand more and everyone should demand more billion people watched 1 million spectaters and what does emi tell you they will put the crappiest dvd together and then make everyone take the videos down of there website i believe i shall find them all and put them up on wikipedia because it is n't 1 person who owns the worlds creation anyone who believes in this should know what it means to them every extra cent of this dvd should go to africa and it doesnt it and its a bloody shame all i can say is i am making sure this goes on to every review for this damned dvd untill something is done about it viva la ristance d real lenbo ||| 0

there 's lots of passion in wide sargasso sea the book but it 's mostly emotional it 's an extremely novel and the work of a true master the film on the other hand is just your classic bad film beautiful to look at with lots of skin languid copulation heaving bosoms nonsense etc and next to no substance it has no artistic integrity whatsoever as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the jean rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did i was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character the much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe and it also lacked much enthusiasm they were incomplete and contributed little if anything to the plot the viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between edward and antoinette therefore they should have either gone all the way tastefully no pun intended or have left those scenes out entirely now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book but for those who have n't read the book there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat from the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family despite the narration why did the keep laughing something vaguely explained in the movie though apparently fully explained in the book why did n't the parrot fly away what made the mother go nuts at no point in the movie were rochester 's issues '' as it were fully explained the man gets a letter exposing his wife as a creole and dumps her like a hot potato after as christophene explains he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place what a hypocrite again maybe this is the ultimate point that rochester is a snob and the archetypical victorian englishman and that antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the jamaicans but none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film so despite the beautiful cinematography this movie is a hopeless muddle i 'd highly recommend the novel by the way a book you do n't forget in a hurry needless to say i think you should give this insulting to the memory of jean rhys film a miss especially if you 've read the novel it 'll just frustrate you no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time ||| 0
the novel of wide sargasso sea was decent book a of jane eyre 's bertha but the film is really hard to tolerate it starts out although it seems to start deviating from the book early on past the point where antoinette marries rochester the film turns in to nothing but soft porn and the acting gets worse too ||| 0
the lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real edward murrow and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the but otherwise i 'd did n't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short boring movie that seemed much longer maybe i 've just seen too many biopics lately ||| 0
this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of why i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind but it was a mess ||| 0
i was hoping that socermania '' would be on the extreme sports fun '' dvd but no ! instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the disney treasures '' this also goes for the other two dvd 's extreme music and adventure fun allthough 'pluto 's blue note ' 'donald 's dilemma ' 'no sail ' 'old sequoia ' and 'trailer horn ' are on dvd for the first time but with the new disney treasures disney rarities '' and the chronological donald volume 2 '' which might i add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration who needs these dvds so i suggest not to buy these cheap dvd 's and buy the treasures in spite of the bad restoration ||| 0
film 4.5 stars dvd 0 stars dvd released march 2000 this is a very good albeit not great film whose dvd release has been ruined by disney as they so often do 18 ! minutes deleted from the theatrically released version transfer it 's been over six years since the dvd was released one can only hope that an version is in the works however based on disney 's track record and on the quality of their marketing wizards '' i 'm not holding my breath do n't know if disney licenses to criterion but if so that may be the only way we get a decent dvd release ||| 0
tyrese gibson for worst actor ever up to this point i 've been a huge paul walker fan for his comedically bad acting he 's made a career of it in this one his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word bro '' at least 75 times to give his character street cred and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops it 's clear walker is deeply considering his plight but really walker ca n't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of tyrese gibson my god where did they find this guy the movie would 've been ok as a standard mindless action film but it really was ruined by the grade drama club acting now you might be wonderning who 's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie but wait there 's actually method to this madness since their was no vin diesel the director knew he had only paul walker left and it 's well known that walker can not carry a film see timeline '' so what to do of course ! find an actor even worse than walker and cast them together ! all of the sudden walker does n't look so terrible because everyone 's focusing on this other chump and apparently it worked because a lot of people enjoyed this film and there 's even a sequel ||| 0
i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert ||| 0
do n't let the cover fool you this film is n't half as fun as you may hope it is maybe it 's my own fault but i was expecting something more like groove '' or at least something interesting to watch and it 's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands i often listen to joy mondays and more from that scene however this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory than it did about the music and almost as a documentary i almost stopped watching it out of boredom but saw it through anyway now i would n't call this bad it had it 's good parts just not many ||| 0
party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung if best in show was not enough that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste the british scene in the 1980 's was influential and at the height of the brit wave and michael winterbottom could have exposed the in a much better way my main issue with this film was it 's attempts at being funny in a fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious the dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway and the film never really follows it 's premise as much as it should the rise of factory i did really enjoy the joy division segments though even if exploiting ian curtis 's death was slightly in poor taste unless you 're a fan of the brit explosion of the era and an extreme fan at that i could not recommend this film it 's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into ||| 0
yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc can turn candy into cuisine ||| 0
all these shows are the syndicated are at least 3 min cut from each sucks big time for releasing edited shows not the first time see soap other seasons of good times mine back and got a refund ||| 0
beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that was real disappointed by gate this film is tepid there is none of the satanic that you find in 'rosemary 's baby ' it 's too hollywood surprisingly considering the maverick presence of film opens well with a suicide and depp 's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere exorcist 3 which i was equally disappointed in at least was more satanic i wo n't spoil anything for those who do want to see it but the showdown scene between depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed emmanuelle seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a demona and the 'showdown with the devil ' is a letdown to say the least this film could have been great but polanski dropped the ball considering he was the and the film fails in all three areas it 's not horrible so i give it 2 stars but do n't buy this film rent it only buy angel heart instead ||| 0

i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie ||| 0
i 've been a fan of the who since i recieved my copy of tommy on vinyl in 1970 for christmas i resisted buying this dvd set for a long time because of the price and knowing that if it was a current release that townshend would be playing an accoustic guitar while someone backstage would be playing what he should be he started doing this due to hearing loss years ago the who hasnt been the same since watching the tommy performance will make you seasick its so out of sync it just goes to show that some publishers and performers will let anything out the door to make another buck i had just moved to las vegas when entwhistle died there of a cocaine overdose it was somehow prophetic in a way i didnt have tickets for their show that week but i thought with his death it wouldnt have happened anyway surprisingly it did its all about if you 've never seen this band in its heyday go get a copy of their live at the isle of wight festival show or woodstock for a second choice and see what this band was really like and shame on the people who let this recording hit the shelves i hope they choke on the money ||| 0
what were they thinking ! there are actually scenes deleted from the original theatrical release ! ! the extended edition is an abomination '' if there ever were one furthermore i discourage anyone who has not seen the original from purchasing this product seek out the original release because i believe the original '' release included in this set is not of the same quality david lynch was right in not becoming involved in this edition ||| 0
this may be entitled warner classic holiday collection '' but warner had nothing to do with the production or distribution of boys town men of boys town or the 1938 christmas carol louis mayer may return to haunt the christmases of those heretics against the one true religion of mgm who purloined spencer tracey mickey rooney and ann rutherford to enrich the reputations of harry jack abe and ted ||| 0
absolutely terrible the most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of dane cook nothing happens in this movie and i mean nothing except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging comic '' glances and looking withdrawn and cynical i do n't think a soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better so on that point it 's a success all the sullen understated lines and glances are supposed to be 're not they 're boring somebody needs to tell wes anderson that too asap ||| 0
i think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy i do n't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim especially about how it 's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character but being in a liberal arts college i have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following the characters and the situations remind me of the short stories i would write in the sixth grade when i was around 12 years old where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you 're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating inane nonsense the whole movie feels like ones self trying to write about adult problems that they 're distanced from yet infatuated by this movie appeals to the type of people who like to read catcher and the rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their but more like i 'm so sad 'cause i do n't have a girlfriend '' lives into some sort of literary wellspring i think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing it 's unfortunate he ca n't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic subtle '' messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say hipster drivel look for something else to watch ||| 0
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee '' the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i had n't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was 2 fast 2 furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he 's a refugee from the outsiders but the movie 's not a total wash after all it 's got a great soundtrack ||| 0
seriously i am an expert and this movie sucks but imagine for a moment yes stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound strikingly engaging and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals those ' whose tastes likes and dislikes decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all besides this interesting question which is put forth explicitly without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry and in about 60 seconds the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs ||| 0
the only extraordinary thing about this film is how ow could take such a fascinating subject and drain the life out of it i found myself wanting this to be over about halfway through after i dozed off do n't be fooled by the other review here they are the true fakes if you know what i mean save your money and save your time ||| 0
following live 8 i have to wonder if live aid justifies the euphoria that followed it most people if honest would say that on the whole musically it was pretty bland and as for achieving its that 's debatable what it did manage to do was make bob geldof whom no matter how honourable his motive were done quite nicely out of it thank you before this his career was on the skids and now he is a household name knighted by the monarchy and very very rich the same with pushed them into the statosphere and made bono think he is some sort of latter day prophet same with queen pushed them into so do musicians have a conscience or was it the chance to get maximum worldwide publicity push their latest album all for fifteen minutes of stage time sounds pretty good to me one ca n't help wonder that they could all give there royalties for the past year and wipe out the third world debt without coming on stage and screaming 'give me your money ' there was a shot deleted of course where backstage the good and the great were dining on expensive food and wine whilst up on stage was a backdrop of the starving another example of there hyprocrisy madonna singing 'imagine ' on her latest tour right ! i ca n't help but think for all there posturing there was an eye on global exposure and a chance to feel good about themselves when they went back to their mansion and who would dispute that mccartneys version of 'let it be ' was stomach churning face it the only musician peter green mac who wanted to give everything away to charity got certified proves a point ||| 0
capote '' directed by bennett miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005. it is based on gerald clarke 's 1988 book capote a biography '' the film starts by capote 's philip seymour hoffman interest in the kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime his knowledge of the criminals especially perry smith clifton collins which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship the writer is sympathetic and sees in smith a strong resemblance with himself yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it in cold blood '' was his most famous novel the one that established him as a legendary writer he was left overwhelmed confused and unsatisfied however the movie is quite ambiguous though characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive at many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations for instance people are always laughing heartily at what capote has to say although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter the setting and the music were both barely significant although philip seymour hoffman 's performance is highly remarkable the actor 's resemblance of capote is questionable hoffman is '' and more stout than the slender barely '' truman capote ||| 0
this movie is utterly unremarkable actually scratch that this movie is actually very remarkable because of how bad it is first of all the protagonist is pathetic it 's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems all she does is cry and moan second the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers i 've seen in any movie third there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered which disrupt the movie 's flow and continuity for example the protagonist gets hit by an truck and her car is absolutely mangled but she walks away without a scratch someone care to explain how that 's possible i probably would have stopped watching this excuse for a movie if i was n't at a friend 's house and there 's the fact that it 's his movie i sat through it just to be polite when all is said and done this movie just is n't worth your time i 'm glad i 'm not the one who actually paid my dollars to buy this piece of dung ||| 0
i 've been had is all i can say after reading other reviews i really thought this would be an interesting exciting movie instead the story is lame the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so not scary or at least gripping i watched the whole thing as i thought maybe i am missing something but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end sorry guys but this is nowhere near audition tale of two sisters or even whispering corridors ||| 0
if you 've seen tortilla soup there is no need to watch this movie this is just the chinese version of the said movie the similarities of these 2 movies are so prominent that it would actually be a waste of time and money to buy both same characters same plot only in a different setting i got to enjoy the scenes with food though ||| 0
this movie is no heathers '' it 's not even mean girls '' as hard as it tried to be witty shocking dark and satirical it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop maybe i 'm just too old for this drivel although i could watch clueless '' and the craft '' until my dvd player breaks but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push i just did n't get it the movie was n't funny which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses carol kane could n't even elicit a smile out of me the plot was full of holes and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived i was n't expecting greatness when i watched jawbreakers but i was at least hoping for 1 hours of mindless entertainment unfortunately the entertainment '' piece was dropped and i was just left with mindless ||| 0
my wife and i ejected this dvd after half way through and planned to throw it out i later figured i 'd see if it got any better and watched the rest of it the last guy is good and i wo n't throw this away now he does a bit on throwing up that is good most of the humor is gutter humour and is not that funny ||| 0
almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree ||| 0

rent it but by all means do n't buy it you wo n't watch it more than once this movie is not for those who have invested hours into the tv show although you will better understand what 's going on if you have seen the show none of this will really seem new or interesting to you you learn some new facts about bob and the man from another place but nothing important for the most part it just tells the story as we have already pieced together from the show adding only pointless and unrealistic new occurances bobby kills someone donna is replaced by an new actor coop forsees all the future comings of laura 's murder etc all of the twin peaks charm that you have come to love is gone and the movie really suffers from that you ca n't only give coop 10 meaningless lines and expect the show to succeed i think lynch 's efforts would have been more successful and greatly appreciated if he had made a sequel to the second series focusing on the complications of coop being in the black lodge harry having an emotional attachment to coop but being forced to bring him down etc i guess if you have never seen the series this may be more interesting but i dont really think so overall the look and the feel was very foreign and uncomfortable and it moved very slow it is somewhat of a letdown coming from a monster like lynch i 'm glad i 've seen it but hell i 'd rather watch dune again before this ||| 0
this is the classic submarine war movie and most submarine vets will tell you that this is the best movie i greatly enjoyed it and it is true sub action based on what i read about submarines the special effects are a bit cheesy you can see the wires pulling the torpedos and you can tell that they used scaled model ships but if you overlook those items you get fine acting and a good plot with plenty of action ||| 0
i hated this movie it is one of those ones that you keep watching because you think it may get better and it never does stupid plot too many holes and stupid ending ||| 0
i suppose if you never read the book you might think this movie is good maybe even charming but having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel i was so grossly disappointed i ca n't tell you see the book is about two people novalee and willie jack they head west together until willie jack abandons her at a walmart they part ways on more than one level his life goes as low as a life can and her life rises beautifully it 's a study in contrasts and it 's done impeccably in the novel with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey but it did n't translate because of hollywood 's mentality hollywood cut benny goodluck a main character in the novel completely out and shaved moses another major character down to a bit part while making novalee 's a major player and they destroyed forney who is supposed to be eccentric genius withdrawn and strange they turned him into a stud type with a crooked smile so not forney i never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life that horrid and lexie she 's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and tendencies and they put ashley judd in the role hello ! ! does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you that 's just the biggie complaints too read the book do n't watch the movie you 'll be amazed at how inept hollywood was at telling this story ||| 0
this movie is basically about 12 old boys crying with each other when does that ever happen the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids what 12 old worries about getting out of this small '' i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense i have a feeling oprah would like this movie ||| 0
dont get me wrong i 'm kinda young but i love 80 's 90 's movies specially the horror ones i had great spectation for early geoge romero movies but both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad gorge romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry but for today standars they are not even they are not that good for most of the 80 's 90 's movies the bad 1. acting is not beleavible it looks like the were acting '' 2. the dialog 's are not how people actually talk 3. the soldiers at day of the dead '' are a shame they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline they behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups 4. more than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other 5. i think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans listening music shooting talking '' 6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment theres is not any frightening atmosfere the good 1. the gore scenes are really good maybe too much bloody it shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated so far the only great zombie movie i have seen beleive it or not is resident evil 1. resident evil 1 has it all resident evil 2 not resident evil 2 is one those just shoot and kick '' movies and i 'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo so if you want a gory movie maybe you may like this movie but the gore is just at the end of the movie you will be better pleased with cabin fever '' if you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe resident evil 1 poltergeist the original japanese version of the ring and the grouch scarecrows alien aliens and even alien 3 not alien 4 it sucks but the best review is your own so i recomend you rent them and judge them by your own and decide if the worth the price ||| 0

if your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of end of the century '' or filth and the fury '' this ai n't it ! picture taking 40 hours of bad home video really awful sound and editing together and calling it a documentary no current interviews no voice over making any sense of the chaos no thought to flow or storyline just a mishmash of stuff banged together a real dissapointment the saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance i 've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due its a shame this is what its been reduced to shame on everyone involved ||| 0
i picked this set up despite reservations reservations being luke perry and the guy from the cosby show because of the creator michael straczynski unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff it 's really nothing more then a c average show normally that 's not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel showtime and costs over 70.00 on dvd it 's just not good enough specific problems i had with the show include a lot of filler episodes the season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line the show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story this is the model that hbo uses production value is also sorely lacking once again i 'm going to compare to hbo i feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks the hbo series carnivale has unbelievable production value the set 's locations costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality the same can be said for deadwood and rome but carnival makes for a better comparison but jeremiah all looks the same you can tell the show was all shot in the same location every back road and town look like they are in the same county the biggest problem however is just the premise a post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get 's tired fast i had to force myself through the last 9 episodes luke perry 's quest to find valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery simon 's quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled so basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent plus if you need any other reason to dislike this show then know that jason presley makes a guest appearance just what this show needed a 90210 reunion if you 're looking for a great show this is not it if you can watch it cheap give a whirl but do n't waste any hard earned cash on this one ||| 0
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible horrible film mindless banter and weak story line our copy eventually broke stepped on we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star '' seems like a generous rating ||| 0
well i wrote the review about this set and boy was i disappointed when i got it i see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection the transfers are terrible and the sound is worse come on guys at least try to put some effort into it ! ! ! i got the set watched it and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use what a waste of money ! ! ||| 0
gina is just like the protesters she just does n't get it ! '' the liberal way of doing anything is throw more of our tax money at it ! whereas africa 's problems including poverty aids will never be solved until they get the birth rate down ! as long as more babies are born than people dying their population goes up very bad the only way to eliminate poverty is less children ! ! send money for that but nothing else ||| 0
the concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded the girl in the cafe '' turned out to be a political message i wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character gina '' gina browbeats the members of the conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows does the thought ever cross her mind or the person writing the script that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of all varieties of venereal disease children born out of wedlock etc maybe gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly this movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an r rating for nudity and language ||| 0
this should be called the john ford tiny collection '' as most of his major films are not included even john ford the early years '' would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of ford 's work shame on amazon for their collaboration in this matter and for advertising the john ford collection so closely that it is easy to mistake one for the other ||| 0
for me this movie is a painfull thing to watch i wish that i could give this 0 stars the infamous fake o '' scene kind of recked true intamacy for me it may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable one of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with just fyi ||| 0

this film is definitely not a masterpiece i found it incredibly dry and incomprehensibly yes the film was bleak but inexplicably bleak to make matters worse the main character seems to resolve her numbness almost out of nowhere perhaps i missed something gigantic because i was trying not to fall asleep while watching this drag on but i would not attempt to see it again however there were a couple of memorable scenes i would strongly advise renting it before purchase some people do love the film but i do n't understand why ||| 0

into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites having seen the pbs presentation of this i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play the staging by forcing the viewer 's perspective this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath i am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director 's vision ||| 0
i purchased this movie because i love chris cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive i played the movie yesterday and boy was i disappointed the movie was much too slow and boring i love mysteries and hate dramas therefore i thought the little personal stories throughout with flashbacks actually detracted from what i thought was going to be a good mystery story in the end the mystery is solved with a thud and do n't get me started on the quasi luke leia moment at the end please ! ||| 0
this is a horror '' movie in the sense that it is incredibly grating and all the people in it act like total garbage i do n't mean the acting is garbage though it is i mean that all the characters in the movie are complete human garbage such as make you want to start your own special death camp just to get rid of them if the aim of the movie was to turn the viewer into a murder wave then bingo i am locked and loaded and ready to ratatatatatatatattat blow away the cast ||| 0
i generally admire jennifer aniston 's work so i picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn sadly watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie if you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes you would't miss much since nothing really happens if it 's a comedy it is n't funny if it 's a slice of life the lives are deadly dull the emotional level is so you suspect the entire group is on valium jenifer aniston especially seems to have phoned this one in real characters as it happens i 've known thousands of real people over the years and not a one bears the slightest resemblance to any of these characters if they 're actually representative of real americans then we 're in big trouble ! my wife i had the same reaction at the end of this one that '' s it ! ! '' ||| 0
dull and pointless how could jennifer aniston read this script and think that doing this film was a good idea we had to turn it off about through shallow boring superficial take your pick it 's like a contest which character 's life sucks the most if you 're going to depress people at least make it interesting would it have been so hard for the writers to mix in a plot with their nihilism ||| 0
colin firth and kevin bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50 's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man with firth as the anchor of the team the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives but i found truth '' confusing and unengaging i found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo and as several have noted lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible give this one a pass ||| 0
the human race today is in a really bad state mainly because most people do not want to wake up they want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power '' miceal ledwith in the great questions in the hamburger universe vol 1 of deep deceptions i thoroughly enjoyed the dvd what the bleep do we know ! '' mostly for the engaging snippets of dialogue from scientists theologians and mystics i also enjoyed ramtha 's dvd create your day '' even though it was n't quite as good as the bleep cameos it was with great expectations that i viewed the great questions in the hamburger universe vol 1 of deep deceptions by miceal ledwith unfortunately the plodding pace of the 57 minute dvd as well as the ramblings of ledwith was very disappointing ledwith brings up some great points in this dvd but never goes beyond the surface he asserts that thinking people have discarded most of the infantile tenants of the hamburger universe '' the vault of the heavens '' overhead with the vault of hell underneath yet instead of treating his audience as intelligent folk he makes nebulous comments without explaining the what and why '' he mentions string theory quantum physics and the true '' nature of the big bang going on to say that levitation is n't a miracle '' but only a matter of superseding gravity with the torsion field '' the problem is that he 's tossing about these terms in support of jesus ' words that ye are all gods '' and greater works than these shall you do '' without actually explaining the meaning or of a torsion field and just how consciousness supersedes natural laws fyi the torsion field is quantum spin waves of empty space einstein and elie cartan did some preliminary work on this theory in the 1920 's the theory could possibly be used to explain esp among other things ledwith spends a good portion of the dvd highlighting the silliness of traditional christianity including the clouds and harps of heaven he goes on and on about how a cloud is in reality damp and would be uncomfortable to sit on duh and that if one were to play the harp for eternity they 'd wear down the fingers to the third knuckle i understand highlighting the damage that traditional christian thought has caused humanity especially in terms of evolution in fact as a former minister trained in theology myself i probably get it '' more than most but while poking fun at christian thought is popular these days you had have some theological and scientific claims to back up your assertions especially if you want to be a part of the thinking '' christian apologists know their bible inside and out so if ledwith wants to undermine their illogical ideas he needs to do so with his supposed area of expertise theology heck even at a simplified level all one has to do is consider that if an individual set a paddle on fire and repeatedly hit a baby with it over and over and over this act would be considered a barbaric tragedy condemned by christians and others of course yet god the father would do much worse by condemning humanity to eternal torment forever and ever apologists would say well humans choose to go to hell '' the interesting thing is that the bible says no man can come to the father except the holy spirit draws him '' because his understanding is darkened '' this is just one of the many points that ledwith could bring up but instead he preaches to the new age choir by ridiculing monotheistic religions primarily christianity via nebulous assertions in fairness ledwith makes excellent points but nothing that you could n't get much more eloquently from marianne williamson gary zukav eckhart tolle neale donald walsch and others some of these points are '' we are pawns tossed about by those people we perceive as more capable and enlightened than us '' if jesus were on earth today he would n't recognize his own teachings '' anyone who looks back at our history can only be appalled at the the hostility the barbarism that has characterized our whole traverse as a race '' we do n't realize how following another 's image of god is spiritually and evolutionarily limiting we do n't even think of it '' the flat earth mentality still corrupts and completely distorts our fundamental beliefs at the basic level still today '' we 've never gotten rid of the inquistatorial mind to this day '' the answers we 've been given by religion are bizarre emotionally charged and childish '' heaven varies according to the broker christian denomination but the basis is pretty much the same earning credits for good behavior so you can immigrate to heaven '' god is just a human magnified in monotheism we take these categories from the lowest plains of existence and impose them upon the divine as a result we 're left with something so sentimental mawkish and inaccurate that it bears no relationship to reality '' whatever god is has no gender these childish images are holding us back '' ledwith makes other interesting comments but they beg for elaboration one such comment is '' that jesus ' death was to appease the vengeance of a savage god this had nothing to do with what jesus christ did '' i 'd love to hear his explanation of the crucifixion ! spiritual teachers such as williamson have brilliantly explained the metaphysical aspects of the crucifixion of christ does ledwith have a clue as to why jesus died if he did why did n't he share it he quotes jesus by saying greater works than i shall you do '' attempting to make the case that humans are living far below their potential mostly due to a flat earth mentality what he fails to mention however is that polemicists and theologians debate the meaning of greater works '' meizona toutn in the greek in terms of whether greater '' refers to quantity versus quality my greek professor made a case for the former saying that converts would multiply miracles by sheer numbers ledwith also perpetuates the biggest misquote circulated in new age circles attributing it 's not our weakness that frightens us it 's our power '' to nelson mandela the actual quote is our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure '' which was uttered by marianne williamson in her book a return to love '' one of ledwith 's comments that i found particularly insightful is as human knowledge grows the territory of god shrinks god becomes a refugee '' the god of the gaps '' as he called it are areas that we try to fill with human knowledge in the attempt to explain what we do n't yet understand an example would be ancient paganism attributing lightning to the actions of zeus despite this interesting observation it 's not enough to enliven the rest of the dvd what separates the tight insightful segements in what the bleep do we know ! '' from this dvd is that the conversations captured in bleep were the result of directors chasse arntz and vincente asking probing questions of the experts questions borne out of the directors ' own curiosity and personal paths on the great questions in the hamburger universe vol 1 of deep deceptions however ledwith is left to ramble at the camera rather aimlessly which does n't make for good viewing and does not offer lucid alternatives to the flat earth mentality of the hamburger universe perhaps this is more the fault of director '' jz knight in the end i could n't help but feel like this dvd was thrown together in order to capitalize on bleep 's popularity let 's hope the subsequent installments of this series are tighter deeper and smarter ||| 0
chamber '' was always the worst entry in the harry potter series but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse choppy editing horrible humor personified by the untalented rupert grint smug acting by the equally untalented emma watson poor screenwriting by that hack steve kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack chris columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience skip it if you can ||| 0
perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of lincoln 's various works such as the sacred place the messianic legacy and holy blood holy grail or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books the dvd will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books however it is simply not successful as a video or as a video about the da vinci code the narrator lincoln takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the languedoc home to the cathar heresy and the albigensian crusade and points out some interesting details in his wandering yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture as well he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals many inspired it would seem by lincoln 's books and repeatedly editorializes against their actions i finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark can not imagine what else lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour ||| 0
i go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this dvd to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if i did n't want to leave the house i was a little disappointed in this dvd i love self magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising the routines are broken down into four separate workouts the only one that involved any effort on my part was the section as for the rest the other sections would have you do too few reps i felt to get your muscles warmed up let alone reshape them i think this dvd is great for beginners its simple enough to follow and it wo n't scare you away too soon but if you 're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine this probably is n't the abs workout for you ||| 0
i looked at the name groovaloos and i looked at the cover and my gut told me not to get this dvd i went against my gut and believed the reviews i wish i 'd listened to my gut for those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey you 're right on the money they can all dance but compared to what i expected they seemed mediocre here 's the lowdown 1 the sound sucks they 're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine but the music is n't loud enough to really feel '' something that makes you want to move 2 they just seem like a group of people who do n't naturally have a rhythm but they 've learned some moves it 's so not inspiring 3 it 's not edgy enough and 4 it looks good if you 've got a group doing it but when someone 's doing it alone it 's just okay overall this dvd was okay but not great get it only if you 're truly desperate ||| 0
i was a huge fan of the books growing up and a lover of the period and jannette oke 's books i had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series well i just finished and could hardly stop from yawning while i watched ! the movie started out well enough wonderful filming great costuming glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time no the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie the scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch i remembered the tomboyish missie from the last film and could n't wait to see her older the actress portraying the older missie just did not do her justice ! while she was pretty she read most of her lines flat with little emotion the worst was the very ending which was supposed to have been a moment between father and daughter instead fell completely flat in fact most of the scenes with missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left i think there were several attempts to portray missie as spirited like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid missie we were continually seeing apart from that the rest of the cast was average with a few star moments here and there i ca n't remember the book very well to check for accuracy but the story was as well melodrama only reared its head in a few places only if you want to keep with the series i would recommend this otherwise i 'm glad they replaced missie 's actress for the next film perhaps we 'll get to see a more energetic performance ||| 0
viewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time many of those films that stand the test of time are from the fantasy genre including labyrinth and dark crystal would i add neverending story to that list hell no the dubbing is atrocious funny germans and the costumes and effects '' are bad labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days and easily trumped neverending story when it was released two years later the story and plot had the potential to be interesting but the execution makes neverending fall flat and sure neverending story may have advocated reading in the 's but labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics which is the next step up for mind expansion ||| 0

i hope people do n't start to think of this movie as alien 5. in my mind this is a whole new venture one that is separate from any of the work that sigourney weaver did on the first four alien films the first 4 films are pretty good and i really like the whole series it works rather well and i would love to see another alien film with sigourney in it i think they could pull off one more film ripley 's a great hero this movie was pretty bad the only reason i give it 2 stars is because of the special effects i felt like i was watching a scooby doo version of alien whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money the plot and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much each of the first four alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of sigourney 's involvement this one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair ||| 0
francisco was right this film is about as as buttcrust the review on the back of the dvd says jaw dropping but the full quote probably reads jaw dropping because i was lulled to sleep like a baby '' there is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage in the zombie attack scenes but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie the rest of this film consists of the whines and infighting of the human characters and extremely unlikable caricatures of a and extremely redundant evil side of human nature '' message that would be better left to jean renoir or even adam sandler considering the results here i do n't watch zombie movies for the characters especially characters so vapid and unengaging it seemed like the script writer read a novice 's how to pamphlet and said yeah it needs some conflict '' if these characters were n't so constipated and bloated i 'd give them a chance one amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of social commentary '' but that 's just a mindless observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully it was n't you 'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass the critical ambitions of this movie are and embarassing and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director 's real talent which is you guessed it the lovely undead the rest is monotonous dreck i do n't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man 's dramatic rags all that aside the ending is the worst anticlimatic in the history of horror movies a horror movie that sucks for of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself but the at the end makes you wan na kick the director in the gonads sorry but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin moron ||| 0
there was one scary moment in this movie the quick scene showing the girl in the closet when she that was creepy i then awaited more moments like that nothing nada lame tries way too hard to be creepy and artsy and just landed up being dumb and that young boy what is up with that he 's trying to be like the kid in the sixth sense who was brilliant and totally believable this movie did not scare me and the idea of people being afraid to use vhs tapes after this come on ||| 0
i have not seen this movie nor do i ever want to i 've only seen the previews on tv and read about it in previews why do i think it 's probably one of the stupidest pointless movies on the face of the earth because i bet just about every guy who 's had trouble getting girls watched it took notes and believed each and every single thing that was in this movie and believed every sentence that was in this movie where you got to hear the woman thinking out loud in the movie i bet many guys took this movie way too seriously well i bet some of the stuff said in there where it has the woman thinking out loud was garbage not all women are the same and not all men are the same you ca n't believe every thing a woman says not all women want what that one individual woman wants and some women lie but hey nobody 's perfect every guy had individual tastes too and guys lie sometimes to i for one as far what i finad sexually appealing with a woman 's appearance like women who are a tad bigger i like'em to weigh about 140 to 160 lbs if they 're around '' to '' yet there are guys who like petite women i personlly do n't know why there should n't be a movie that tries to help guys get girls the movie title what women want '' was just wrong i bet many guys thought of it as the gateway to seriously improving their game if they 're looking for a date i personally think guys put way too much emphasis on trying to find out what women want i do n't think that should be necessary i think it 's ridiculous i think the guy should be himself like the girl is practially all the time and just feel good about himself not every girl is going to be into every guy i think is probably the most important thing for a guy to have when trying to get women i 'm a guy and that 's my opinion ||| 0
having enjoyed lost in translation i thought i might like this one which seems to have some sort of cult reputation why i ca n't fathom the entire plot is shallow and unrealistic i guess it 's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values and while i do n't condone those the film lacks clear characters or any motivation a lot of people have buttoned up parents who do n't get it and it does n't mean they kill themselves because they were grounded ! since the gerw up in hollywood she may not be aware that you ca n't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason social workers and what not come after you so the entire premise is false romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers could actually encourage the act it 's not caring not real and not responsible but i guess that would n't bother the rich overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself ||| 0

it is a shame that american film classics like l and h get more attention and love outside of the us than in it i just bought the universal laurel and hardy 21 volume box set which is only available in europe from amazon uk region 2 this set is everything people are saying it is it is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films some solo efferts and goes though the hal roach features all the prints are restored and of pristine quality a truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys there are some missing films i assume for copyright reasons such as babes in toyland the devils brother bonnie scotland and flying deuces to acomadate these dvds i bought a region free dvd player off amazon which is the only way to go if you really want to collect the dvd player was very cheap plays beautfully and is well worth the investment as a side note if you have a region free player all the dvds in the universal box set are also availble as single dics in case you do n't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films if you love laurel and hardy this is the only way to go ! anything to screw hallmark and the corperate monster ! ! why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute prints ! ! ! ||| 0
personally i found 8 to be one of the most boring films i 've ever seen it was a pretentious trip down the director 's memory lane i understood the plot and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end but overall was bored silly by stilted pointless dialogue having said that the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching perhaps 8 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment SMILE ||| 0
okay this is a really bad movie that said there are some moments here that are so bad that they 're funny the fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving sandra bullock is outright hilarious and very embarassing how she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery but the acting in that scene is ridiculous as well however it is certainly memorable sandra bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film but her role is essentially a throw away part then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor steve buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in his character never returns to the story after that by the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues the acting is bad the budget is obviously low and the script which invokes the occasional giggle is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel avoid this film ||| 0
what do we do when first started watching wrestling in my early teens ric flair was a hero of mine he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever so when this dvd came out i got it immediately hoping to relive my youth but i realized something all the matches are the same there long and dull the same moves are done over and over and the matches only pick up when flair opponent takes the advantage there is nothing wrong with long matches if that are done well like the iron man match between bret hart and shawn michaels but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long so it can show flairs endurance i also noticed flair is so repetitive all wrestler use trademark moves but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life for example chop woo flair flop figure four cheat that not a description of one flair match that 's every flair match when i started watching wrestling i only saw his wwf matches so it all looked new to me when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are other wrestler have put together dvd which shows a variety of different matches such as eddie guerrero chris benito bret hart shawn michaels all top wrestler adopt to there opponents flair expects his opponents to adopt to him that 's way all his matches are the same the only thing worst then his dvd is his book i lost all respect for flair after a read his book it seem that he is just like hhh and shawn michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face put does it behind their backs he bashes mick foley for being a stunt man who only does gimmick matches so what 's hhh a guy flair calls great can anyone name a good hhh match that is n't a gimmick match wm against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight he says foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles he critises bret hart for not putting over shawn michaels at survivors series 97 when he was called upon to job to lex luger before he left who the wwf he refused and took the title with him to wwf brining the wcw to its knees after watching this dvd reading his book and seeing how his using backstage politics at the wwe now to keep himself in the limelight its fair to say the ric flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way i could have won 16 world title if i had my friends booking the show ||| 0

i remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of heaven 's prisoners into a busy saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera our little filmgoing party of fans and alec baldwin groupies my mom my stepfather and me found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment baldwin who also served as brought james lee burke 's new orleans alcoholic hero dave robichoux from the printed page to the big screen while baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out burke 's characters and have some tangy dialogue they 're hampered by two things 1 the film 's pacing maybe the louisiana heat got to everyone not just baldwin of all the actors long island native baldwin sweats the most so much that it began to remind me of the gags with albert brooks in broadcast news and robert hays in airplane ! 2 a plot that as rendered in the film whether it 's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor i ca n't be sure never quite follows through on any of its elements it 's too bad because these elements could 've made for an exciting movie drug dealing illegal alien smuggling rival crime bosses one is played colorfully by eric roberts before he became a parody of himself essentially playing a version of his character from director phil joanou 's 1992 thriller final analysis an adorable little salvadoran orphan girl named alafair '' by the robichouxs after dave 's mom late in my pregnancy at the time i liked the name alafair so much i nearly changed my mind about naming my daughter siobhan ! and a bevy of beautiful beguiling women including earth mother kelly lynch vampy teri hatcher in a nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time and mary stuart masterson looking like a young jessica lange in what was then a role for her a troubled stripper who loves robichoux despite the sexy promises in the movie 's ads none of the ladies share anything with baldwin but dialogue and some kisses embraces maybe the climate was already so hot the filmmakers did n't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor baldwin collapsing from heat prostration ! as my mom put it at the time i thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy dashing alec baldwin but he came up sweaty rumpled tired depressed and moving as if he was in slow motion if he 'd made love as many times as he got beaten up it would 've been the sexiest picture of ! '' to be fair there a number of strong characterization and action scenes but there 's just too darn much talky lag time between them and yet oddly some of the scenes end abruptly just as they 're about to become intriguing ! perhaps joanou baldwin could 've dredged a tighter more involving thriller out of this if they 'd whittled the running time down to 105 minutes or so as heaven 's prisoners is now well read james lee burke 's books instead ||| 0
i 'm not going to write too much if you need to hear more just check other reviews down here from all the 3 episodes only the first one by is worth your time the hand '' is well done and typical beautifully shot by his usual contributor christopher doyle it 's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch gong li always very elegant give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story well crafted but very predictable the director lately seems to be referencing himself which is halfway form self parody equilibrium '' is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots is a simple and boring exchange between downey playing an adman and his analyst played by arkin but the worst by far is the antonioni 's episode is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment the once great director should have just retired by now he was 91 in 2004 and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces ||| 0
after seeing both peyton place and the sequel i can tell you that i could tolerate the recast carol lynley and tuesday weld were wonderful in their perspective parts but i have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well my reasons for asking the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie over and over in this film it is stated that selena was raped when she was thirteen yet in the original film selena alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school also she looked pretty mature for thirteen then there 's selen'as boyfriend whose name escapes me at the moment in the original film he stood by her through the murder charges the revelation of the rape and the miscarriage yet in the sequel i 'm suppose to buy that he could n't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of selena yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast i have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door it was all too obvious that the original film was n't taken into account when writing the sequel not credible at all ||| 0
this program is evil it is easy to get sucked into watching gantz because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters who have all died find themselves in they have gone to purgatory and purgatory is like an video game one feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries the art direction is decent visually it does n't look cheap the english voice acting is embarassingly bad especially the main character but not as bad as the dialogue internal and vocalized that this character has been given to speak the worst thing about this series apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners is the action '' scenes these inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow after you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video if you do n't feel like banging your head against the wall you are made of stronger stuff than this first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers and more frustration than satisfaction save yourself the pain ||| 0
i would n't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that i had to when i saw what christiane schmidt had to say now we all know mr gibson has got issues with the british as well as others just look at that other pile of tosh braveheart but here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous the usual response is it 's not history but hollywood it 's fiction based on historical events '' but the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that ! now i 'm sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war but i 've never read of the british burning down churches with people inside nazis yes no but who cares about whether it really happened 's only a film ! ! good grief next thing you know they 'll be making a film about the us recovering the first enigma machine ||| 0
let me just start by saying that i do n't own the chosen collection '' but that i do own the original releases of all seven seasons why review this then quite frankly i believe the combined sets to be a waste of money i have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this they are as flimsy as this set is and just as breakable the set 's discs appear the same as the previous editions probably a rehash from leftover sets a bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor but since i do n't own it i haver never seen it i spent my money on buffy the vampire slayer '' once and once is enough for me buffy is a endearing series but why throw away dvd sets just to have them return '' from the garbage ||| 0

director turi meyer cast tony todd donna d'errico alexia robinson jsu garcia mark lupe ontiveros elizabeth guber rena riffel ernie hudson running time 93 minutes rated r for bloody violence and gore sexuality and language the third in the series derived from a concept by clive barker day of the dead '' they ca n't even come up with their own subtitle staggers down the path already navigated by the halloween '' and nightmare on elm street '' movies that is taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet the original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine this one is just a load of rubbish donna d'errico from baywatch what a spectacle of credibility stars as caroline mckeever the great great granddaughter of the feared candyman tony todd once again once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest as the candyman hacks his way through various bad actors caroline teams up with new pal david nick corri to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the candyman while he was still alive which may hold the key to stopping him there 's not a single thing here that is n't scavenged from the first candyman '' film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days the screenplay is so lazy it ca n't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot the photography is bright and glossy which is at odds with what 's supposed to be a dark story while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all anyone could have directed this movie so little effort has been put in to make it scary while the ending is an outrageous cop out no thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having d'errico running around in a variety of tight vests the rest of the performances are poor too although none are quite as bad as d'errico 's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically surely more can be done with characters like the candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone 's stomach the fact that the makers of this movie think candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just ca n't be bothered even to try something a bit different clive barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be but he 's right about one thing the sequels to his movies are garbage ||| 0
the saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series i can remember the first time i watched the original created by clive barker i luv 'd it the same ca n't be said for this film caroline is last living descendent of the candyman and he wants to end it all by ending her all who watch this film and the acting of donna d ' errico will wish for the same thing one would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of baywatch for the film and for that reason only or maybe it 's because a little fragile thing like her ca n't take on candyman head on get a real actress like kathy bates in there and she 'll kick his ass misery is a classic as far as tony todd is concerned he does a good job in this film but not as scary as he has been in the other films he does a good job none the less and serves as a as far as the script goes it 's a decent attempt at the franchise al septien director turi meyer do what they can but that does n't save the film from being less then average side performances from the art gallery owner the two bad cops and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little there is n't much to the story caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her people she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it and she tries to stop him that 's it nothing more to it over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable ||| 0
maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking but i doubt it since vanilla ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new i went to high school with kids like this and i 've bought the eminem cd and there 's a little more to them than the stupidity but let 's discuss the movie anne hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in east seeing her boyfriend beat down she 's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating then she goes to parties gets into even more trouble and starts losing her jerry ghetto talk the mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there 's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner but well he 's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner actually he 's coming off like a gangsta yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat yes it 's ironic that she 's trying to dress ghetto while he 's trying not very hard to dress suburban wife beater is suburban the movie 's climax is a scene in which anne and bijou ask the guys if they can join their crew '' and if the gang did n't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked they sure have it then and really who does n't know that that 's gang initiation standard started by the hell 's angels in 1965 after that disaster both anne and bijous say no but bijou takes a little more time saying no the movie unravels as anne hathaway discovers her inner white girl and her friends act even more stupid there 's a neat scene between her and bijou philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people but it 's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie the one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate dj squalls ' character from hustle flow and hustle flow in and of itself since that 's a white character in a black world that does n't fall into either extreme of wigger or doogie howser he 's just himself whereever he goes he 's someone the morons of this movie could learn from but really would n't you rather just see them all shot dead ||| 0
this is a great flick for people who are irritated by because there are none there is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie so it makes for excellent escapism which we all need now and then since all the characters stay together it is easy to follow along so you can turn your brain off it wo n't be needed since it 's all about the ship acting was n't necessary you can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of russell and dreyfus i felt pity for them as actors and hope they can rebound the movie is shorter than most so there will be minimum impact on your life you will remember nothing about it soon after exposure ||| 0
i am 38 and considered obese however i work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy this dvd would be great for the older generations i still need to loose 45 pounds and i am using denise austin 's burn fat fast ||| 0
i think denise austin does a decent job in some of her other videos but this is n't one of them she lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she 's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot the moves are not well choreographed and very awkward some may find encouragement in the times denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says we 're burning butter yeah '' but i found it annoying i think there are much better workouts for the money out there ||| 0
definatly one of the worst movies ever the dialog is so boring i had an attack trying to watch it i usally never turn a movie off in the middle but i had to do it with this one i tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it so i would never have to suffer through this again the characters are so lame i did'nt even care about who was threating his life i wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it it sucks ! ! ! ! ! and it is really dated ||| 0
love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one ||| 0
i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe '' the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this ||| 0
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now ||| 0
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of ||| 0
this movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre far less interesting than pulp fiction and even below the level of reservoir dogs it is said that in the violent late middle ages street shows were often staged in european cities where fake blood flowed like water heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines during an evisceration delighting the crowd it seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come full circle from barbara tuchman 's gripping account of the awful fourteenth century despite the abundant gore if the film had been better handled it could have been quite good there are glimpses of its failed potential at different points for instance the scene towards the end where the prison governor 's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct copy of an actual event at the bastille during the days of the early french revolution in sum as a special kind of disgusting art form it is interesting as entertainment though natural born killers sucks i admit some people will like it no doubt the same crowd who would attend public executions if they were available for viewing ||| 0

i was on a plane from shanghai to bangkok stop drooling and i was reading a book on the tv i saw tim allen chasing an orange cat in the course of the chase he dropped down from two legs to four the effects i 'll admit right up front were great this looked far better than the old i think version called the shaggy which i have n't seen but even so it sucks i did n't need sound or subtitles and i did n't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks true sucking is like that yeah i saw the bit with the scrabble board i am dad '' whoop dee freaking doggy doo it 's possible we underestimate tim allen 's ability as an actor perhaps because the santa clause was so unforgivably bad but even so this movie sucks sometimes life is just that simple ||| 0
i am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival and i have to agree with anybody that says this movie is the whole cast is wasted in this movie and most of which i have seen in movies that i liked better like pretty much the leads in this movies i have seen thier movies and liked htem better in but this one they might as well if your a tim allen fan please do yourself a favor and get either the santa clause movies or the toy story movies and avoid this movie at all costs here are 99 minuts of my life that i wo n't see again and i am trying to make sure that you do n't waste your time on this dud who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog in some scenes in the movie ore pretty much the whole thing i have n't seen monster house or cars but i hope that these will be 2 better movies or maybe a season dvd of home improvement will be pretty then this dave douglas tim allen is a lawyer that dislikes dogs and even has a case against animal activist justin forrester joshua leonard and he is up for accused of trying to torch the california headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate grant strictland and he does n't much of a family life since he is never home and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie his wife is rebecca douglas kristin davis and they have 2 children josh spencer breslin and carly zena grey and he has an appoontment to josh 's pta meetings and even through he is reminded at work he forgets carly is not only a is both forrester 's student and a budding animal advocate herself and her brother is trying out for football like his dad even through he secretly hates it and did n't sign up for the fall musical and then there is a mad scientist robert downey trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a dog he had kidnapped from a tibetan monastery and carly even kidnaps it from grant strictland and brings him home nad even trouble starts when the dog bites douglas that gets him starting acting like a dog too and even looking exactly like him at times the movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old which would be impossible since neither dogs or people live that long all i can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes and this is one to avoid at all costs ||| 0
it 's a disgrace they charge money for this dvd producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold fine if people want to experiment with filmmaking but to release this film with big name actors and charge consumer unforgivable i prefer to have rated this with no stars ||| 0

mccully 1 adam mccully instructor lee hobbs engl 101.025 18 november 2005 red dragon when i heard that universal studios was making a prequel to silence of the lambs i 'll admit that i was a little skeptical throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which more or less is what this prequel was caddyshack ii godfather iii and bill and ted 's bogus journey all horrible follow ups to great films so naturally i was a little worried that the film red dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film any movie that follows a great film like silence of the lambs has a lot to live up to personally i thought that the first sequel to silence of the lambs hannibal did n't quite achieve that and neither did red dragon it was a decent movie but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first do n't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value but since it did n't come first i had already come to expect that i thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films but clearly their work shows otherwise all in all this movie disappointed me for several reasons as i mentioned before the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that i as a fan of the films had come to expect but mostly it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors i 've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception ||| 0
this is day 10 now and im still waiting for my package ! ! ! ! ! ! amazon seems great but when something goes wrong they run like chickens ! however bird is the man and dont ever forget that ||| 0
i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i can not compare the character to other sources therefore coming from someone that did not know '' darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment ! there are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies like the shadow batman etc which is interesting nevertheless darkman was quite a disappointment considering the of the cast liam neeson larry drake and frances mcdormand among others it is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement in an effort to exact revenge he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his in short the acting and the plot are average nothing great while the dialogues are way below average the movie falls into the type of category the characters are overall bland and just plain uninteresting rick anderson played by the fool '' ted raimi from the xena series though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really in a nutshell it 's not a movie you would want to add to your collection but it might provide for an evening 's entertainment and that 's about it no masterpiece here 2 stars ||| 0
let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even boring '' to my friends so it is n't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me it is n't the unresolved ending that bothered me it was n't the violence in short bursts it was n't the acting the acting was pretty good actually but as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure i did n't care who was sending the tapes and i did n't care what would happen with the main characters they were unrelatable on just about any level this movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 's of the way in and you 'll think wow i wonder where the story will go next '' and then it does n't that was it very disappointing i do n't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there 's some kinda payoff in the end i really do n't understand all the acclaim that this movie got as a suspense '' movie or as an art '' film it fails pretty miserably the premise was a good idea that went nowhere slowly viewer beware ||| 0
this movie sucks ! it is fake everything is staged chicks dont laugh when they fight nor do they dress like strippers ! ||| 0
this dvd sucks all the fights '' are fake retarted drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time i 've ever had in my life i am now stupider for watching this dvd and buying it is on my list of regrets i have in life i wish i could say the only good part was but there was no good part no shirts ripped off or good hits thrown nothing i am a marine stationed in japan looking for a dvd to enjoy and this is what i get where is the love ||| 0
killing me softly '' has one of those scripts that just do n't give the audience a break not only does it set up an improbable situation but the big twist '' at the end is also predictable unless perhaps you have n't seen a thriller before in your life the chemistry between the two leads is also lacking fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned he 's an inexpressive bloke while heather graham is all too expressive she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera besides she 's not even that attractive even her in this particular film natascha mcelhone blows her out of the water in that department the ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker ' candy in your mouth sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour it was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did i have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly in spite of all that chen kaige 's direction is good and he creates some suspenseful moments so i give the film a generous out of 5 '' rating but if you 're a heather graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes and for joseph fiennes fans you 'll receive half naked perks ||| 0
whatever possessed jessica lange to appear in this mess will never be known the payoff at the end is a huge disappointment jessica lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in gwyneth paltrow is unbelievably bad but i think this is not their fault the screenplay and direction could have been better this could have been a very good movie along the lines of misery '' or fatal attraction '' but it fails in every department as i said the payoff at the end is a real disappointment this film is a waste of time and money stay away from it ! ||| 0
kelly preston and tcheky karyo are a new york city couple who come together after preston leaves matthew broderick and karyo uses meg ryan in order to get a visa now broderick and ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex 's the problem is the offenses they 've endured being dumped and being used do n't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people especially karyo which is probably why director griffin dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles after all how can we not root for ferris bueller and harry 's sally unfortunately it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive the pace of the film is so uneven and the script is n't particularly funny there 's a difference between black comedy and just comedy despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches this film does not walk that line very well ||| 0

surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism by female director heckerling ! she duplicated it in chevy chase vehicle national lampoon 's european vacation too ! many child actors got their start here but the thing that cracked me up as i saw it when it came out nately was the dialog of my fav band cheap trick ticket scalper the magntism of robin zander and the charisma of rick nielsen and what about the tunes 'i want you to want me the dream police 'you 're momma 's alright your daddy's alright they just seem a little weird surrender surrender '' before he 's interrupted if that is n't somebody's idea of 'surrender ' they 've stumbled onto this review by mistake ||| 0
i have been a beatles fan since 1964 and i have distinct memories of the band 's influence on my young life i saw hard day 's night help ! yellow submarine and let it be in the theater when they were first released this film has always been the holy grail of beatle fandom now that i own it i can honestly say i understand why it took so long to release it to the public that thirty years of isolation locked up in a vault somewhere in london only improved its standing in my imagination not on actual film the bbc was right to bury this as a film or television special it 's horrible but as a fan i had to have it now that 's all i can say about it i own it when will let it be be released ||| 0
upon its initial release the attention that otto preminger 's anatomy of a murder '' attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems when watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center attorney paul biegler james stewart is asked to defend lieutenant frederick manion ben gazzara after a bar owner is found murdered manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife laura lee remick was raped while preparing his case for trial biegler finds that laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature nevertheless the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him stewart is his dependable self in anatomy of a murder '' in fact his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film there is little nuance in the performances of gazzara and remick and even the great george scott misses the mark with an effort yet the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay anatomy of a murder '' oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story the investigation of the crime is done in a manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction for a film to run as long as anatomy of a murder '' does one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film yet this is not the case ||| 0
there is a certain school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash '' but at least that was somewhat assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream '' motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours and as much as i usually enjoy george clooney i might never forgive him for this drek ||| 0

i am really wondering about the people who have reviewed this and gave it such good been looking at their other reviews trying to understand what it is they like because this movie stinks ! im a huge reese witherspoon fan and i like paul rudd so i rented this movie and thought it would be good oh boy i was wrong the charachters are over the top and the story is just cheesy im all for a good fun romantic comedy i like win a date with tad hamilton '' but this is just awful reese plays a stripper somehow it just doesnt work who helps the dorky hopeless rudd dump then win back his girlfriend all the time there is a package to stop hence the name overnight delivery '' the story could have worked but it just doesnt the premise is good and there are parts that are somewhat ammusing but overall it sucks i would reccomend this movie to anyone who liked the sarah michelle gellar movie simply irresistable '' if you happened to like that movie with the magical little crab if you disliked it as i did then stay away ||| 0
george sluizer 's original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes ' plot the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration ' but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they do n't even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they 're given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the mood shifts in the couple 's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he 's probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 's end on a joke like a tv cop show ' moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score ca n't do anything for this one ||| 0
while some critics can argue with dan brown 's research and reasoning on certain historical points one thing these da vinci debunking '' presentations will never be able to refute is this the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity primarily by the catholic church and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago 1969. nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still quite frankly shocking and debasing sorry but upon this rock '' of male dominancy was built the church thank you again dan brown by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations obscurations and lies these obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources worth trillions through guilt control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power and those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty dan browns put together people are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been jesus ' actual relationship with the women in his life or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive men 's club with jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship to answer these questions some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of or from spiritual corruption the next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the vatican thrown open for public view lord only knows what plunder they contain ||| 0
i enjoyed the movie even though i was only able to watch it in segments the first time i tried to watch it after about 20 minutes the screen went to digital gibberish and my dvd player hung up so that i could n't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power i had to unplug the dvd player wait and replug the power cord to remove the disc overnight i decided i needed to replace my dvd player however the next morning i tried a different dvd and it worked fine it still works fine on all my other dvds i complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of showgirls unfortunately this one has the same problem it plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my dvd player i gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without showgirls i use my dvd player almost every day and it works fine except when i try to watch showgirls ||| 0
i read the book and saw the movie which other than title and major characters have little in common i ca n't say i really liked either the book is a little funnier my major learning from the whole project was when who wants to be a millionaire '' taught me about roman a clefs '' of which devil '' is one perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that devil '' provides meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly of runway magazine but somehow she 's never quite devil enough anne hathaway is passable in her second or third made over princess '' role the minor characters including the wonderful tracie thoms as best friend '' lily are mostly wasted ||| 0

during my teenage years i was a fan of wwf wrestling and specifically the rock he was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest most disgusting lines ever mentioned on wwf tv his talent in the ring was and the rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete he rarely made a mistake in the ring but he made a huge mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to hollywood it 's not that doom is really a bad movie sure it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters it 's just a normal film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense and that 's it i 'm sure the movie would 've been big had it been released 10 years ago todays generation is probably sick of action films such as doom okay so it does go somewhere but the film is n't really designed to build to an creative story doom is the kind of movie you do n't really want to seek you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick action fix so you rent the movie watch it and then forget about it the next morning of course i 'm sure you do n't forget to rewind the tape because that 's impolite the rock never should have left wrestling it was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans and the rock means millions really miss him come back home rock please ||| 0
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those are n't basinger 's legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd 's characters and keeping in form he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film but that 's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however his contribution seems way overstated to me he does n't have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her is not like other people basinger 's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think blinks i suppose it 's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that 's it flat and mechanical ||| 0
ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander got my tickets in advance and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater the movie was a huge dissapointment while i was n't expecting the movie to be just like the book i certainly was n't expecting that while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears despite the fact that i 've read it over 100 times ||| 0

this must have seemed like a great idea at the time '' cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor '' the problem is his range is all the way from a to this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many chance '' happenings in the end all we get is this thriller '' and i use the term very loosely that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling ||| 0
even though i would agree that erin brockovich '' is an entertaining movie julia roberts performance in it is no more than was her performance of a prostitute in pretty woman '' i am second to no one in enjoying a good david and goliath '' story but this movie has such shaky roots in reality it is more of a tall tale than the true '' story of a historic class action suit that i would imagine left more unhappy plaintiffs than it did satisfied ones however as the movie title implies this is indeed erin brockovich 's story in the same way that the xena '' character is the main attraction in xena warrior princess '' though it should be noted that xena 's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character erin brockovich is a vain brassy boorish single mother of three young children with no marketable work skills a transparently opportunistic manner who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in pretty woman '' prior to richard gere 's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree the movie 's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident her lawsuit is lost primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony swearing cursing and shrieking from the witness stand while being questioned by opposing counsel unbelievably erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney 's played by albert finney firm mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk later while handling the paperwork for a pro bono real estate sale erin discovers the file contains the seller 's medical records that for reasons she correctly does not understand seem to be of particular interest to the buyer the mega utility company pacific gas and electric erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg e had for decades negligently contaminated the ground water surrounding one of their power plants hinkley ca on the edge of the mojave desert with toxic hexavalent chromium this discovery leads to the queen mother of all lawsuits at least in terms of the award in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg e by and through the representation of erin 's boss in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs roberts gives a photogenic if not especially gifted performance in her role as erin the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts literally gushing out work clothes '' that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents while there is much to be said for erin 's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit she is not an especially likeable character rather she is rude verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry the aged and weary attorney who is erin 's boss the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy mules than on the personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters aaron eckhart plays the affable gentle biker and george who becomes erin 's the convenience '' factor is totally and for erin 's benefit exclusively she unabashedly uses george for free childcare thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar bonus '' check from masry when the tort action case settles contrastingly george gets a thanks '' for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed make no movie is about erin brockovich indeed i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present and less about the brave struggles with illnesses that the plaintiffs were forced to face due to the toxicity in their water source erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience in typical hollywood fashion as a sort of heroine but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich is the movie not even slightly ||| 0

i watched this movie all the way through only because i paid 22.00 plus shipping and felt i should give it every chance to redeem itself it is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings i would give it -10 ! ! rated r '' for what language adult content i have seen disney films more deserving of the r '' rating this movie was silly definitely not entertaining in any way and i threw it in the same bucket i put my dog 's crap in when i clean up the yard i am a chris isaak fan have all his cds and went to his concert on december 9. the fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately even his music i did not find the film offensive i enjoy hard core porn i feel this is a rip off poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone ! ! ! ||| 0

the film has its amusing and even touching points but not very many the big problem with rh is that neither ford or benning are sympathetic characters henry is just the kind of smug arrogant corporate ass that 's helped step on working people for real so it 's really hard to feel anything for him shot or not he 's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is if you think about it appalling and his wife is in a way even worse she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides she goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up and does n't become normal '' ntil much later only their daughter has any heart at all maybe a better ending would 've been henry 's not making it bening going nuts from losing her stuff and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should 've been from day one barely watchable ||| 0
love michael buble but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience parts of michael 's head was cut off and then sometimes his whole head was cut off most of the time the camera man did n't expect where michael was going to move to and you 'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get michael back into the picture i wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert that this was just home made videos this was definitely not worth 20 if you want a professional quality concert i would recommend buying michael buble 's caught in the act caught in the act was worth the 20 bucks you get professional camera men who anticipated michael 's movements and parts of his head was never cut off like come fly with me 's dvd also the sound quality on caught in the act was way better now i understand why some places sold come fly with me dvd 's and had the word enhanced after it the dvd that i received was not enhanced anyways skip this one and get caught in the act '' instead ||| 0

despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality this film is a complete the long '' scenes wedding russian roulette etc are much discussed usually either in the context of being essential for character development '' or boring '' in fact they 're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills once he does try to move things along awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated to another you can see the reason for his procrastination despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth he really has nothing to say the actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film 's awkward vacuousness by giving false and impressions of character and narrative but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything happen '' 2 stars is rather generous but de niro walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting albeit for such a misguided cause ultimately despite some controversy many of the film 's questionable portrayals of vietnam vietnamese america americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy ||| 0

this pride and prejudice fan was hoping for a movie with a storyline much closer to pride and prejudice even colin firth could'nt save this one for me ! on its own i found it sadly lacking in just about everything i look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor if you are a true pride and prejudice fan i recommend buying the bbc series and the 2005 movie version both are excellent i would'nt waste my time again with this one ||| 0
if this movie were set in the us i would 've given it 1 star but the british accent humor and colloquialisms partially saved it but not enough sorry to say ! why not because despite a few mildly surprising and utterly contrived plot twists here and there this film is still built on a particularly toxic myth the desperately lonely and insecure single woman who is made to be as endearingly pathetic as possible for the audience to root for her inevitable finding by a right here the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby clumsy and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing almost from the first 5 minutes this movie just reeks of audience manipulation as it slogs through the same old trite cliches and recycled bits was there even one character in this whole movie do n't remember any maybe because i 'd like to forget this dreadful of a flick asap ||| 0
it seems like the actors did n't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts ! amanda root is terrible as anne elliot overly timid and shy captain wentworth is n't at all handsome or dashing and when they finally get together at the end it 's so awkward bland and unclimactic you wished you 'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book some people might have liked it but i definitely did n't to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice this movie could have been bette ||| 0
apparently this is a film that many women who have read the book can make enjoyable characters including anne the captain display wooden acting others speak at a clipped pace the properness of the times allowed for personality as shown well in pride prejudice '' 1996 2006 but not here shyness plainness or slowness may be portrayed likeably with some personality both anne the captain maintain desperate looks constantly many of us do get nervous within romance but we are compelled by conversation and activity to interrupt our nervousness with personality thus anne 's the captain 's constant nervousness is all of us at the age of anne and the captain would have refined our nervousness to be responses of shyness thought distance hopefulness approval or alarm you understand the quiet thoughts because of the story in spite of the confusing paralyzed looks rather than because of them you come to like anne and the captain toward the end in spite of the wooden acting because of the story 's ending this film has pretty scenery such as walks along the ocean the costumes are often very unique and well done there is beautiful singing in one scene and even better wonderful singing over the closing credits good period romance films are so few and so desired that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is i applaud their positive imaginations however they continued their fanciful wishful thoughts into rating this film a reviewer who liked the film says she had read the book and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film a poor script for those who have not read the book awful directing made awful acting i would like to see this good story by a better director romance films are pride prejudice '' wives daughters '' north south '' fairly made is under the greenwood tree '' ||| 0
all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane 's life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane 's life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is at best an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the murder suspect in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane 's extracurricular activities my interest in the film was as a hogan 's heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful series bob crane 's professional credits alone would make for a good film auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane 's secret life '' and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane 's private life auto focus however should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan 's heroes television series ||| 0
i was optimistic for greg kinnear once he was very funny ragging on soap soup he usually plays the second banana in film or a man dying of aids auto focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960 's tv icon hogan in hogan 's heroes the replication of the original cast is a bit eerie after all these actors dress up as german prison guards a chill goes down my spine but hogan 's was a comedy which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny ss guys anyhow bob crane played hogan for six years and kinnear badly imitated yes i 'm sorry to say kinnear is awful as crane which puts a damper on the here 's a disc jockey with 60 's patter on the air with an all american family a loving wife and cute kids they live like ozzie and harriet in the la burbs going to catholic church on sunday crane lands his big break falling for the trappings of fame most people fall for the trappings of fame read the supermarket check out magazine racks so all of a sudden crane 's garage porn collection is n't enough women very beautiful hollywood women find crane and his buddy william defoe irresistible the birth of the video camera comes into play the trouble with the script or maybe it 's the cardboard way kinnear acts we watch but in the end we do n't care ||| 0

i just watched this movie version of the classic childrens ' book with my wife here are my gut impressions first very little is true to the book that 's not really a gut impression that 's the impression i got hearing my wife say that 's not in the book that 's not in the book '' actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling it makes for beautiful stills and pictures and those made me want to see the movie i expected a heart warming christmas story and what i got was about an hour of frantic scenes of railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why i 'm watching you get to see a kid chasing a ticket through a train a kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train a ticket making its way through the forest rube goldberg style back to the train forty minutes into this movie and one girl 's train ticket is the star of the show ! ok the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have a train sliding out of control on the ice a train trying to outrun cracks on the ice a train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster fans of the coaster tycoon '' series of computer games will feel right at home until finally it arrives at the north pole then the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have a train car running out of control through santa 's village kids getting lost in the christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory and then kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to santa 's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf ho ho ho at least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so i can help these kids out ! it 's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion you know it 's awful but you ca n't look away ! and you 'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this it could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up my wife and i were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons and we were very glad that we did n't so what could have been a classic enduring and endearing compliment to a classic childrens ' christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that does n't advance the story or develop the characters one bit whatever a character driven '' story is this is the opposite never have i seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little i 'd rather set up my old american flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while i read the book to my kids ||| 0
the picture book of the same name by chris van allsberg is one of my favorite christmas stories of all times so i was pretty excited to hear hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like tom hanks was a leading participant what a disappointment ! the movie 's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy there are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo apparently supernatural who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting christmas messages such as do you believe in ghosts '' the lighter '' scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling admittedly i saw the movie in dvd format on the small screen and i am told many of the scenes played better in yet the polar express '' still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children ||| 0
this film is a tough one to review the film itself is amazing so therefore i should give it high marks the problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature as if we came from outer space or something that is a bad and dangerous message and so i feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that amazing footage but ultimately does nothing but further the sensationalism required to seek and destroy more animals and natural habitats how many grizzlies are hunted down and killed every year how many humans are killed by grizzlies every year then take into account the fish we killed off because of dams pollution and over fishing that destroy the bears food source how many grizzlies kill humans how many cars kill humans should n't we all be more scared of cars i agree with the other reviewers that have said that this guy is cracked and we can with nature but not in the way this nutjob tries to do it native americans whom we also destroyed with them for thousands of years they respected the grizzly this guy no more respects the grizzly than does the cancerous civilization he condemns treadwell was very conflicted and troubled not that we are n't all troubled not that we all do n't deal with failure and disappointment not that a good rant does n't make you feel better from time to time but he had a death wish and this was really just suicide by bear the way i saw it am i the only one that noticed he seemed very at odds with his sexuality lastly in some of the interviews well they were just weird and contrived like they were acting these weird people in this film do nothing but harm the cause ||| 0
wasted talent none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying some funny stuff craig ferguson can do better charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters ||| 0
there 's a reason why they talk about the voice of an angel '' it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one her acting debut i 'll be there '' is proof enough only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres where it rapidly dropped out of sight rightly so seventeen years ago paul kerr craig ferguson of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert fast forward to the present kerr discovers that unknown to him his ex rebecca jemma redgrave gave birth to a daughter olivia charlotte church who is now a paper girl the problem is olivia has been kept a secret from her dad rebecca is embittered but kerr wants to get to know his daughter and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father music seems to be the thing that will bring the girl and the rocker together but rebecca does n't want her child to follow in her father 's footsteps i 'll be there '' was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler who despite being only in her twenties has had an immensely interesting life well maybe someday she will get a biopic because i 'll be there '' is only similar in one way it involves a rock star and his daughter otherwise it is boring in about every way that tyler 's life is interesting with a forgettable script not much humor and a goofy premise the movie does n't have a lot going for it it reads like a disgruntled teenager 's absurdist fantasy scripted for church to act out and not a terribly interesting teenager either it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest it 's an obvious ploy to show off church 's vocal skills the best that can be said of church 's performance is that at times she looks sweet as for acting talent she is bland at best but she does perform some good songs and her voice is as pretty as ever just watch the songs and her actual scenes redgrave does as good a job as she can and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker his is the only memorable role in the film and it 's a shame that the movie did n't focus on him rather than the dull miss church miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film also known as the britney spears approach i 'll be there '' but i promise i 'll get out as soon as i can ||| 0
the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i 've compared the two and the first dvd had good color saturation dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now though and the image of course is higher resolution ||| 0
this was probably the worst royal rumble in history it featured three very bad matches one decent one a lousy royal rumble and an absolutely amazing match brock lesnar big show royal rumble qualifier this match was absolutely awful the big show is a decent wrestler but brock lesnar is absolutely terrible a predictable ending made this match all the worse this match is like watching a tumble weed the dudley boys c william regal and lance storm this was a fairly decent match regal and storm are very good wrestlers and in the tag team forum the dudleys can hold their own its sad though that this was the second best match on the card nice surprise ending though torrie wilson dawn marie if you take out the fact that torrie wilson and dawn marie are very nice to look at this match is worthless unless you are really bored dont even bother watching this triple h c scott steiner triple h did all he could to save this one but steiner really cant wrestle anymore i remember back in the early where scott steiner was one of the best wrestlers in the game now he can hardly even move this match really isnt worth seeing yet its still better than some of the other matches on the card kurt angle c chris benoit there is no way to fairly describe this match it was outstanding phenomenal amazing incredible brilliant these two guys know how to wrestle and they put on a clinic this match is easily one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time and shows that you dont need steroids and steel chairs to put on an amazing match angle and benoit are the two best wrestlers in the business and this match is proof 2003 royal rumble match this match was decent alright there werent any really good spots it was fairly boring all the way through and highly predictable it got a little interesting when the final five were in rob van dam kane undertaker batista and lesnar unfortunately lesnar is an awful wrestler and he looked pathetic out there with other talented wrestlers a guy like brock should never be in the royal rumble it 's sad when the worst wrestler by far in the match wins its sad that an event with one of the greatest matches of all time gets only a 2 out of 5 rating but theres nothing much to watch here other than as i said the rumble was poor the undercard was weak and several of the matches were downright awful the benoit dvd has the match buy that this isnt worth your money ||| 0
let 's face it some of the jokes are funny the one about mike tyson been like someone else 's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny i also found the bit about bill clinton and osama bin laden also funny however jamie dwells too much on the fart joke how can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes after 2 min it becomes worn and so unfunny '' why does he repeat himself so much with that line i am not saying she 's a crackhead just a bit crackish '' it sounds very rehearsed after the second time if it were only for these errors i would have found the jokes altogether acceptable what i found completely unacceptable were the racist jokes that he made against arabs i am black myself but found some of the jokes about islam and arabs to be in bad taste jamie could not even get an arab accent right c'mon guys the accent jamie pulled was an indian accent and not an arab accent i kept asking myself what would black people do if a white comedian say robin williams makes the same crude jokes about black people '' would it be acceptable '' i think not i am sure the black press would slaughter robin if he did i wish to call a spade a spade nonsensical crude racist jobs against any ethnic group black white asian and yes arabs are not funny they degrade and demean for not even managing to get an arabic accent jamie deserves 2 stars from me ||| 0
i enjoy the initial season of murder she wrote very much my wife and i are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to who dun it frequently though it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up often the audio gets out of synch with the video terrible ! we surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons but now about the way through i think we 'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided dvd's ||| 0
i too found this dvd a bit boring the instruction for each pose took forever even in the challenging workouts while explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices i did n't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence also i did not feel as if there was any flow to this dvd ||| 0
terrible voice depressing indoor scenery incredibly disjointed routines do n't bother with this one ! save your money ||| 0
but for me at least i found it rather hard to root for mel gibson 's character given the fact that he was a major major drug dealer when the movie ended with him more or less riding off into the sunset with michelle pfeiffer and all the loot i did n't find myself feeling exactly uplifted by it given the fact that the movie bent over backwards to depict gibson as a loving father a phenomenally successful businessman and a one might fairly say that this movie glamorizes ||| 0
michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one ' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick this is not one of his better films ||| 0

do n't bother wasting your time with this movie instead read the book the book was one of the best i have ever read the movie left me wanting i rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through so maybe i am being unfair since i did not watch the whole movie but honestly i could n't it just did n't do the story justice ||| 0

i myself am a huge fan i had read the reviews here and i thought it was worth a shot seeing it well the script was terrible the story even worse direction do n't get me started one reviewer said it it was like they did n't know whose point of view to choose the soundtrack was awful the ending was sooo stupid did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them they just keep standing there like nothing is happening i really have n't seen a movie this bad in well ever ! ! oh and alyson hannigan 's acting was way better in my stepmother is an alien i think she was about 13 in that role do n't get me wrong she 's a extremely talented actress i blame it on the script rent it do n't buy it you 'll be embarassed to own it i am ||| 0

i thought the movie was alright but i am sorry that i bought it i would rather have just rented it it seems like half of the movie is out of focus i am sure it is on purpose but i just do n't get it there are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price ||| 0
this movie was a bit lame for me robin williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie and the supporting cast was n't much better but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen even if this had been a good movie the green screen was very distracting i would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff ||| 0
i was so disappointed with this video i thought it would contain more than it did but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all i had one ashtanga yoga lesson and expected this video to at least cover what the lesson did but it fell far short this only contains two very basic sequences surya namaskara a b it does n't even go into the full series and i do not think it gives a very good representation of what ashtanga is about there is no instruction in standing or sitting poses at all ! the two sequences are introductory sequences that lead into the poses but this video just stops abruptly at that point i found ashtanga to be a wonderful blend of relaxing yoga that also gives a full body workout as soon as i did it i felt that i had found the perfect exercise and bought this video as a way to practice at home i ended up giving this video away after watching it twice as it does not contain enough information for the beginner to be inspired or even motivated to study ashtanga further ||| 0
if you have bothered to read all the other reviews here i think you will get the point but still unsure think of knightrider from the sure edi used the same voice ! ! then add some thunderbird puppets thats a bit mean at least they had personality then add a dash of on a budget oh and not forgetting that the whole script was written by a seven year old ! a bit scathing you may feel but deservedly so afraid seriously watch some paint dry for a couple of hours at least the fumes will give you some sort of a buzz ||| 0
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens very disapointtin ||| 0

this is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times the owens girls are hereditary witches any man who loves one is doomed to an early death there is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion this requires the sacrifice of a dove two little girls watch years later they 're grown up one leaves to live with her boyfriend but the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck never stand in the middle of a road we see scenes where the neighbor kids yell witch '' as if to symbolize something sally goes when jillian calls her she has a problem with her boyfriend but sally uses a magic potion '' to eliminate the problem now jillian wants to undo what was done the film began to lose me now it was n't funny the spell goes awry they bury their mistake then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles later an investigator comes around looking for jimmy the story drags again more scenes follow they are not funny or scary or even entertaining but a scene in the attic will wake you even if you 're snoozing ! they call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of jillian it seems to work even if they do n't use the standard issue witches broom there is a sort of happy ending sandra and nicole are good actresses but they ca n't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies i 've ever seen bell book and candle '' is a funnier film blair witch '' is a scarier film this falls between the cracks ||| 0
ok the original is a classic and is what 90 100 minutes long jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that ca n't be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous ! ! the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ! peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics ||| 0
after i read erik larson 's wonderful book the devil in the white city '' i was fascinated by the brief glimpses at holmes ' story but this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment the production is amateurish at best complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of mondo carne '' with such a wealth of fascinating information available court transcripts etc do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened this man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the haunted mansion at disneyland truly disappointing perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of holmes this most certainly is n't it ||| 0
this movie was a weak effort by capra who directed it and the star gary cooper it 's a good story just poorly directed capra ca n't hit a home run every time i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on and no extra features on the dvd at least none to speak of ||| 0
this is my number one most overrated movie of all time we saw it at a pretensious artsy theater along with an assortment of and wooly haired intellectuals they all cheered of course when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water then becomes the chief the truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable given the politically correct theme the truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture the truth is that tradition is not inherently evil the truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys basically if you hate men this is the flick for you but it is not good it is not creative there are no surprises there is just nothing there as i edit this it 's no surprise to find so few people liked this review there are still plenty of hippies and politically correct 's out there ||| 0
hello whoever mastered this great film ruined it by forgetting or refusing to provide english subtitles for the japanese and italian characters how can such a thing happen if you find the vhs buy it maybe some day someone will make the corrections until then avoid this dvd ||| 0
this disc is like a whitman 's candy sampler it has a lot of different things but a lot of the things you do n't really want the film covers kids high schoolers college ball and college controversies aba nba through all its decades harlem globetrotters the street game and stars country boys indiana basketball retired old timers hanging in florida current stars marketing are there any hoop videos that do n't talk about sneaker brands public relations fireworks cheerleaders guys on trampolines women 's basketball whew none of these subjects is studied in depth if you 've followed basketball for a while you know and have seen most of this the subject sampling seems to jump all over the place so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want i 'd rather see a dvd star profile jordon iverson or nba at 50 '' or spike lee 's movie or hoop dreams '' etc 1 love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a wilson basketball or it seems like something you 'd see on sunday tv after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends in short 1 love '' is a decent sampling but nothing to sink your teeth into ||| 0
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate strangers with all their flaws abundantly clear meeting once a week for encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate '' tawdry pathetic feel of their relationship naturally one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later anonymity is not good enough anymore ||| 0
comedy comes in many forms everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire and in just friends '' there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types first the movie wants to be a comedy the sight gags are plentiful the physical comedy abundant and often cruel and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic however the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart these elements have been combined successfully in the past '' there 's something about mary '' jumps right to mind here we get something far less successful first the good news there are legitimate laughs to be had in just friends '' and that was a pleasant surprise if you do n't care about character development and just want inane humor you could do worse than this movie and if the sight of ryan reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you check this out right away sadly it 's the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite there is nothing real at stake here to care about and the blame for this falls squarely on reynolds ' character i 'll use the word character lightly here reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working the problem however is that he 's not in sitcoms anymore he 's making movies unfortunately and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character here he plays a celebrity insider a successful trendy record executive and yet he 's not believable as trendy successful or professional his character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero you never know or understand him he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag it 's too bad really because amy smart as his love interest is playing a character i 'm not usually a fan but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down but it 's anna faris that i 'm going to single out for the most inspired performance the funniest bits to me revolve around her character a shallow insane pop star sure it 's an easy target but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious gusto that she is easily a cast standout again some humor no emotion if you do n't expect much from your comedy you might just like this the fatal flaw for me is that i felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship but did n't do anything to make it real ||| 0
i saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies i have seen during the last two years stupid stupid and stupid ryan reynolds becomes annoying if you have brain never watch this movi ||| 0
in spite of the thin plot line and the volumptous semi naked women the comedian bernie mac stole this picture ! he played his part of the low life club owning hustler with perfect timing and high humor he made this movie enjoyable to watch ||| 0
i bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and i was very disappointed first off it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying but the background exercisers really bug me too not only that the moves are strange she does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music i found my neck hurt a lot after that the leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself the ab section too was so old school i was hoping to find some new exercises i love karen voight but this dvd was definately the worst i have yet to purchase of hers all the other karen voight i own i absolutely love ||| 0
i think this film wants to make you vomit i do n't know about you but that is not a quality i am looking for in my films being scared is fine being in suspense is great vomiting is not i really think that is what this film was going for it has some pretty disgusting moments while i was watching it i kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes in fact i am feeling it now as i write this review and think about the movie the story runs like this a meteor falls to earth it has an alien life in it which shoots into people and uses them as an incubation device this of course means then when the aliens decide to hatch out of incubation well its not a pretty picture as you may imagine in the meantime the people who have aliens incubating inside them turn into looking creatures or in the case of the head alien just a big pile of disgustingness the idea itself is n't a bad one and its executed in a relatively skillful way in fact the idea is much more original than many other horror movies but as i said before it 's just too disgusting to be really enjoyable this movie was confused as to whether it wanted to be a comedy or a horror and while it was trying to figure that out it failed in both categories ||| 0
i received this dvd from my brother who is possibly a bigger kevin smith fan than i am i thought the fact that he was giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until i watched the dvd myself the degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and jay and silent bob 's appearances do n't help much i really liked the original degrassi series so i was disappointed by this dvd there are some funny moments in the extras '' section of the dvd but i would still only recommend this as a rent '' or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan ||| 0
the video in this dvd looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a dvd disc a standard disc by the way that 's what you 'll get when you buy this i say this because i 've used those programs before and know how they alter the video this is how they alter it and how it looks on this usa release of the dvd skin color is too red dark shadowed areas are greenish is pinkish grey is bluish white has blue on it the colors are just totally messed up evidence of grey being blue look at robert duvall 's uniform you 'll see him 3 minutes into the movie the german uniform is a grey it is too dark and filled with blue then look behind him at the wall a lovely dark shadow of green evidence of being pinkish when robert duvall walks into that office look at the walls they should be a kind of color but they are not a shade of white at all they are pinkish as he walks into the office to sit down you see curtains on the wall in the office they are supposed to be white but they 're filled with blue at 48 minutes into the movie you see donald sutherland sitting in the grass with the character molly his suit is supposed to be black look at it it 's purple that is not black on top of all that the movie is too dark there should have been a adjustment if you pay attention to dark areas in the movie such as fixtures around a room or an office most times they are pitch black and indistinguished for example look at desk drawers telephones vases black hair black robert duvall 's eye patch not much shading usually pitch black i 've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the north american release i plan to get the region 2 europe release i 'd rather do without watching it on my tv and watch it on my computer in better proper '' quality 'nuff said ||| 0
we were disappointed in this dvd and thought it was a waste of money we did not learn anything new they went through things quickly everything was so basic things that are mainly common sense i felt this was a big huge waste of money and is now in the trash ||| 0
this newborn care dvd is strictly for caring for a newborn infant in other words what you learn here wo n't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks my biggest beef with this dvd is that it totally just skims over all the basics such as how to breastfeed properly how to bottlefeed properly how to swaddle properly how to calm a baby properly etc all the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn each is given about 5 seconds of screen time instead the bulk of the program is wasted on things like preparation '' which interestingly appears toward the end of the program and how the mother should take care of herself these are important things to know but not for a ultimate baby care dvd '' the dvd packaging is also very misleading it says over an hour of hints '' but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of you should always consult your doctor '' warning plus a long credit the actual content is about 55 minutes i 've seen this dvd and the abc of newborn baby care '' dvd and even though the latter is not great it 's better because it goes through the important topics and the demonstrates the techniques clearly between the two dvds i definitely recommend the latter btw you can likely find this at your local library it 's also available from netflix it 's just not worth the price of the dvd not even of the price ||| 0
our daughter has weak muscles and i wanted some workout videos we could do as a family to supplement her physical therapy i saw all the good reviews and thought this would work for us especially since our girls love bears not ! it did not keep their attention and as adults the movie was a tad annoying to us ||| 0
when i was looking for a fitness dvd for me and my two oldest children girls ages 3 and 2 to do together i was impressed with the reviews of this dvd and it sounded intriguing though i was n't really willing to shell out 16 bucks quite yet so we rented it from netflixs to try it out first as adults my husband and i were really turned off by the animated '' bear though our girls liked him another thing that i was n't really impressed with was the camera was at times only focusing on kristi dear 's face or the animated bear and it was hard for me and our girls to follow exactly what moves she was doing when we had to run through the dvd a second time to really get the routine the total time of the dvd is 30 minutes but only about minutes of that is actual or workout time the rest is filler about why we need to exercise and eat healthy foods and snacks which is fine to watch for the first time or two but then i found myself fast forwarding through it to get to the workout sections which if i had to do that every single time i watched it with my girls i would get annoyed really fast my husband really did not think it was worth 16 dollars he 'd be willing to spend maybe dollars on it but no more i gave the dvd 2 stars because kristi dear really does a good job of communicating with kids has a pleasant voice and demonstrates easy moves and routines for kids to do i highly recommend that you rent this first to see what you really think about it ||| 0
the hidden fortress is classic kurosawa in every way except for the wild overacting inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued or given comic material with more edge skewering the upper classes as well as themselves or been less in the focus and operated far in the background this would n't have been a problem but instead we 're offered a sort of dumb dumber beavis butthead of japan 50 years ago and yes i know that is anachronistic but it 's all too true stupidity is funny '' wears thin after a short while and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast oh here comes a rocky upwards incline let 's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up etc which is all too bad because while the rest of the film has its overblown heroics its far from bad the interactions between cast members has both tension and grit while the outdoor settings mark a difference from the usual run of japanese period films though kurosawa addicts like myself will well recall what he could do in roshomon mifune is over the top but splendid and the direction has energy and focus i 've seen this film twice in 25 years most recently just last night again unfortunately my initial impressions were only confirmed and i wish they weren't ||| 0
it is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by roger moore ' performance her 's good for a dandy in the continent but in this film he is not convincing at all he is verry debonnaire like he is just sipping tea in great the film becomes stiff and you do n't believe it the other actors simply try to do something like a farce it is a pity to see the great richard burton in such role eugenia lizald ||| 0
as usual michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours theres alot of great stuff here the interview w marilyn manson the interview w trey parker c but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston i agree with many nay most of moores politics but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution ||| 0
this stability ball workout is definitely a more advanced routine and is not for beginners this was the first stability ball dvd that i purchased and became quickly frustrated with the routine due to the level if you are a beginner i would recommend leslie sansone 's you can do stability ball training if you are a beginner or more advanced i would recommend denise austin 's shrink the female fat zone or the quickfix stability ball training my all time favorite dvd for the stability ball is denise austin this is by far my least favorite ||| 0

i bought this dvd becuase i really wanted to learn the dance moves in you got served '' and was extremely disappointed the only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those i do n't know the freestlye section at the end is fun to watch but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video ||| 0

the first butterfly effect is one of my favorite movies with that in mind i eagerly started watching within the first 5 minutes it became clear that i was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie but after finishing it it was clear that i would have to lie to do that there is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie erica durance naked but it 's too softcore short and pointless to really be worth anything the writing is terrible the story is lifted directly from the original only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion it manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical a feat unparelleled in modern film the protagonist comes off as an idiotic petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with the acting is barely passable for the most part but the story 's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express the first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect how long would he be able to keep doing this would this one be the last in the sequel this is gone but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting if you have any fond memories of the first one avoid this turd ||| 0
nick lachey and jessica simpson have a few good moments in the nick and jessica variety hour but the show looks too in its premise too donny and in some parts and sonny and some others lachey 's performance with babyface is nice how come babyface did n't produce nick 's entire solo album instead of the batch of people nick went to that caused to flop he would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to but having t and johnny bench and kenny rogers makes the show look sadly too how come they could n't get somebody current to perform on it say maroon 5 or kanye west who were both hot last april they wanted to bring back the variety show format but it 's very hard to do it in an internet age and jessica is n't all that good on this show i 'd rather hear her music and albums instead they need to bring new things to the format if they 're going to make another show for now lachey and simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this ! ||| 0
i love love love this movie but you have to make sure you get the vhs version where the vhs cover is the cast riding in the car lucky for me this is the one i own by mistake i purchased the wrong '' version for a friend and we sat down to watch it together the music in the dvd version is terrible compared to the original do n't even get me started on the soundtrack whoever made the blunder of this for dvd needs to be fired ||| 0

instructions rent steven seagall 's latest action movie exit wounds '' insert in dvd player watch first 15 minutes of movie remove from dvd player return to video store if you follow those instructions to the letter you 'll have fun with exit wounds '' which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory seagall attempts to thwart a brash brazen assassination attempt there 's also a great scene that a priceless scene hipster played convincingly by rapper dmx and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot ultimately settling on a lamborghini murcielago paid for in cash out of a golf bag the scene is dope def and cool 's all good dawgz ! in a new jack city way and that 's a shame really it 's so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin over the course of two hours to realize that the rest of the movie just ca n't hold a candle to its opening minutes an action movie should be exciting after seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the vice president a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own and from which 95 of the trailer material was taken exit wounds '' is not exciting it 's stale it 's rehashed honestly were it not for dmx the few riffs from the movie 's excellent rap soundtrack and the equipment i would have thought i was watching an eighties seagall flick and that 's surprising given that the movie is helmed by romeo must die '' director andrzej bartkowiak who also did the cinematography for speed lethal weapon 4 and devil 's advocate the plot what there is of it deals with police corruption and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and does n't make any sense by that time you 've stopped caring you 've seen all of this before better worst of all seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero he 's reached that wheezing shortness of breath stage that afflicted roger moore back in view to a kill '' seagall does n't have the acting chops that moore was able to fall back on tom arnold is thrown in for laughs but the laughs are so feeble and the jokes so stale that you 're laughing arnold and seagall with them midway through exit wounds '' i was fighting to stay awake and that 's a shame given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer hectic energy than any movie i 've seen since '' rent the dvd for that opener if you dare but if you stay any longer you 'll see it 's true old action heroes never die they just fade away js ||| 0

good grief yet another dvd collection we are not buying because disney does n't seem to understand we loved these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete i hope the folks at disney get the message eventually same thing applies to their live action feature films disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production ||| 0
maybe this is not fair to write a review without even seeing the dvd i wanted to make sure disney understands that people do read these reviews and i am not buying this dvd as swamp fox is incomplete ! three out of eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase ||| 0
i recently saw les miserables anniversary concert on dvd and absolutely fell in love with it so i thought i would try something similar and decided to give candide try boy was i disappointed i ca n't get past the first 30 minutes all these silly gimmicky jokes '' that are not even remotely funny the singing is not bad this cast has better technical control of their voices compared to the cast in les miz but the choreography is trite and unimaginative and the acting so juvenille that you 'd think the characters are retarded when the narrator fired his gun and a bang '' flag shot out from the gun instead that was over the top for me yuck ||| 0
my impression was what a waste of money why take such a nice play and do it like that why what 's that old lady '' what sort of character lupone built i read the reviews here and i did n't believe them i should have had but there are good moments though imaginative creative although far from funny ||| 0
as i write this review it was 5 years ago this very day that the walt disney released the classic fantasia '' for the first time on dvd as a anniversary special edition but exactly 5 years later you can no longer purchase a legitimate new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price via such avenues as ebay as a disney shareholder i am one unhappy camper ! ! this is the only reason i 'm rating this classic film with only 2 stars the dvd is no longer legitimately available without forking over at least 40 or 50 for a new copy when the original list price was well under 30 and that current price is only going to go up as times passes by i 'm sure i 'm not the only consumer that 's really sick and tired of disney 's inane policy of releasing and then quickly yanking some of their dvd releases so what am i supposed to do now wait another 5 to 10 years just to buy a legitimate copy of this dvd when disney finally decides that the time is right to release it again i think not ! i ca n't wait that long and my nieces and nephews will probably be too old to care at that point or should i instead pay an insane price now for an original copy the profits of which will not go to disney again i do n't think so ! i do not believe in getting ripped off and refuse to support those that profit from it regardless of fundamentals if disney insists on continuing their ridiculous and outdated practice of discontinuing some of their classic films on dvd after only 2 to 3 years of availability it should n't surprise them at all that they 're actually losing potential sales to versions of the films that are being sold around the world and from auction sites like ebay too the way i see it they asked for it ! ! by not making these classics legitimately available at all times they are encouraging piracy it 's that simple and they deserve it ! ! in this day and age people are not going to wait a few years to get something they want now ! ! i guess disney is forcing me to think about buying a phony yet much cheaper dvd version of the original fantasia '' just so i can show this classic to my nieces and nephews i 'd much rather buy a legitimate copy that 's reasonably priced but i ca n't because disney wo n't allow me to do so oh well it 's their loss a classic film like fantasia '' which came in at no 58 on the american film institute 's 1998 list of the 100 greatest american movies of all time deserves a far better fate than this great job disney ! ! way to go ! ||| 0

i hope i can give a fair rating here but as one member who loves to watch lds films of all types this one is a big i normally will sit through any movie to see if it gets good this one was just overkill that was not even funny i initially sqeezed a few laughs out in the beginning but then it looked like nursury '' comedy if you know what i mean i turned it off after the whole overdrawn toilet scene with the ||| 0
robert wiene 's the cabinet of caligari '' is a celebrated work of german expressionism while there are several interesting facets to it this grand experiment in filmmaking can not be regarded as a complete success francis friedrich feher relays a strange story a man named caligari werner krauss once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival the exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named cesare conrad veidt strange happenings then ensued after cesare predicted the death of one of francis 's friends concerned for the safety of his beloved jane lil dagover francis took it upon himself to determine whether caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events in a strange way one can look upon the cabinet of caligari '' as a bizarre version of the wizard of oz '' 1939 the framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity yet despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation the cabinet of caligari '' is stiff and dreary the characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in give the cabinet of caligari '' points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar ||| 0
there is a coliseum video about the world heavyweight title the tape ends when hogan was champ on his first reign that tape is great gorilla moonsoon with the commentary the jr commentary does n't make this garbage any better the matches are like de ja vu let me think yes i have seen these before because these matches are on each and every other dvd the extras on the dvd show the split seconds each title change i really mean each clip has to be about 5 or 6 seconds i know these matches were supposedly decided by the fans i know i voted were the votes counted in florida there are a million other matches that could have been on this dvd i got the first disc from netflix because i was not going to buy it some may say he is crazy it was great '' maybe for you it is i have seen all of that before i wanted this dvd to learn something new about that history there are no perspective segments or interviews just overrated jr running his yap over matches he never called i want to hear the real commentary with jesse not but wwe screwed that up there are a lot of things just wrong about wrestling now oh i mean entertainment it 's garbage now wwe has put out some good dvds its just they did a crappy job on this one hitman jake roberts road warriors monday night etc etc the dvds about the old days are the only things i look forward to because their current product is garbage so when the thing i look forward to is as luckluster as this dvd sorry if i get a little ticked off experienced wrestling fan get it on netflix or borrow it and go and get the coliseum video if you can find it rookie fan it would be informative to you ||| 0
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinism by female director heckerling ! she duplicated it in chevy chase vehicle national lampoon 's european vacation too ! many child actors got their start here but the thing that cracked me up as i saw it when it came out nately was the dialog of my fav band cheap trick ticket scalper the magntism of robin zander and the charisma of rick nielsen and what about the tunes 'i want you to want me the dream police 'you 're momma 's alright your daddy's alright they just seem a little weird surrender surrender '' before he 's interrupted if that is n't somebody's idea of 'surrender ' they 've stumbled onto this review by mistake ||| 0
i am always up for a new genre of film but the reviews here are misleading the basic plot of the movie is that life sucks yeah thats it the rest of it is just sick if your really into perversion then okay you 'd probably get more out of it then i did but for the viewers who have n't been almost raped by their fathers or killed their grandparents or shot themselves in public this is n't the movie for you if you still want to see the movie try and get it from netflix or borrow it from a friend before you dish out the cash ||| 0

there are cinematic masterpieces and there are films that really make you feel the producer knows how to use film to its fullest this stinker convinced me lynch owned shares in kodak and wanted to sell film by the mile the only reason you may want to see this is so you will convince yourself never to see a david lynch work ever again do not buy it ! ! manos the hands of fate is much more watchable than this i get brian eno and music is so you will use it as a background along with your imagination to create your own inner experience film does n't work that way another reviewer compared this with eno i find memento a brilliant piece of work really making me forget i am watching a film i think videodrome is wonderful and compelling this make sure you can watch something else watch this in speed you wo n't miss a thing okay i just remembered there is one movie worse than this one reflections of evil if you actually like eraserhead then get that movie too me i 'd rather put a worm in my ear from whatever planet kahn was exiled to in star trek ii much less painful than watching this ||| 0

the criterion collection a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and original foundation of the collection is the work of such real masters of cinema as renoir godard kurosawa cocteau fellini bergman tarkovsky hitchcock fuller lean kubrick lang sturges dreyer eisenstein ozu sirk bunuel powell and pressburger the criterion collection must feel embarrassed for wasting a tremendous amount of time in this glorious package to glorify the most incompetent of all filmmakers i did not watch any of the extras but i hope you can find there those hilarious clips from the with welles crying like a baby '' oh they only let me do the movie i wanted to make in kane ||| 0

this story is one of the worst fantasy '' stories ever it is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy story line do n't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to lord of the rings or harry potter for original not to mention secular fantasy and escape ||| 0
i did n't like this video for several reasons the rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands i was looking for an aerobic video i have gilad bodies in motion which is great but was getting bored with it since i had it for four years let me just say i 'm sticking with gilad because denise does nothing for me you do n't even feel like you had a workout with her she 's boring i would recommend gilad for aerobics and tamilee webb for toning tamilee is awesome i have many of her videos and i 'm a true fan of hers ||| 0
this program was boring ! as much as billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were and of course my kids at home and i 'm sure any other kid picked up on this and soon lost interest several things made this program boring one you ca n't understand a thing billy is saying he would mumble unclear phrases thoughout the entire program and his demeanor was very to the point of being fake he just looked sounded very out of place working with kids it came across like he his crew were n't really sure how to interact with the kids making them appear to be very fake another boring point was the movements there was absolutely no creativity here these were some of the exact same movements from the adult videos now i do applaud billy for slowing the movements down unlike the adult which goes at a break neck pace these movements are performed in a controlled manner but they are still adult type movements and extremely boring for kids i would have liked to have seen some creativity with these movements to make them more kid friendly and more exciting ! to be honest my kids were turned off bored with this program after the first 10 minutes something billy needs to realize is kids are smarter than people give them credit for being they can tell when someone is being fake not truly having fun and they also realize that when kids on are bored not having fun then this is n't something they want to do kids want to have fun and want to watch the instructor other kids having fun that is how you motivate children ||| 0
this movie does not make sense and it 's not weird in the style of david lynch it 's just complete crap i thought willie wonka and the chocolate factory was the fil ever until i saw this do not buy this it is not a family movie and it is not funny or entertaining ||| 0
i purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since gone with the wind give me a break ! this movie had an agenda 25 years ago and it still comes across that way in 2006. the rating of pg is a joke please do not watch this movie with your kids ! it is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think the plot is lame and i am sorry i spent the money on it i plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where i can get something that is entertaining this certainly was not i did not even reach the end of the first disc before turning it off for top names in the industry making this film all i can say is they got paid a lot of money for nothing ||| 0
i agree with others ! season by season box sets of beavis are what we fans want ! with all music and b b commentary and no damned edits of anything ! until then mike judge company i will not buy anything b b related relying instead on my own vhs recorded episodes limited in number of episodes as they are at least they 're the complete original episodes that i 've transfered to dvd i want each and every episode uncut and in their original broadcast order who 's the brains behind the lame mike judge collection '' series anyway ! some dumbass idiot working at burger world just from a purely greedy standpoint you 'd make way more greenbacks by doing it the right way for cryin ' out loud ! not to mention retain the show 's and your integrity hell even beavis and 'd think this collection '' concept 'd be lame and stupid ! ! get with the groove mike and give us what we want already ! ! ||| 0
i dont understand why they didnt put the videos in like when it was on tv the videos were the best part ! i asume its because mtv did n't want to pay royalties to the bands so they called it the mike judge collection '' and left them out uh that sucks ||| 0
i bought this dvd hoping that it will be a good one but it turned out to be awful and trashy there is no story or plot to it so i ended up throwing it away i really regret buying it if you 're into sex then this film is for you but let me tell you this it is boring like hell ||| 0
each scene is one shot and that shot goes on and on and on sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action this film is pretension personified but that 's okay many people ca n't tell the difference between pretension and art the music too is full of squeaks and squawks in case you did n't know that means that the music too is high art there is no story boy and girl see each other and without preliminaries hit the sack we see boy girl here there in the sack here there in the sack etc occasionally we get a shot of some of the other characters because of the lack of dynamics the film is not effective either as drama or as eroticism ironically the summer of '' was much more erotic even without any nudity which would have helped the vaulted sex scenes are three in number chest and shoulders and they last about three minutes each the fellatio scene is actually surprisingly good more convincing than the love '' scenes there are also a few brief scenes of the star who has a gorgeous body hence the two star rating bottom line the only reason to see this movie is the nudity and the sex but there are many better movies for that so only if you need the pretentiousness in order to permit yourself to see a sex movie should you see this ||| 0
i can not believe people excuse me some women are giving this movie four and five stars interesting premise and it could have been a good believeable movie but it was sooo syrupy if this is what it 's like to be in love please somebody shoot me note i 've been in real love for 27 years now i got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end why the does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a good movie '' i felt like i was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over would n't it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out that at least would have made the movie more intriquing believeable and redeeming if ever a movie was made to force tears this is it this movie stinks and i do n't mind telling you so and it 's not just because i 'm a man either imo there 's not much difference between this movie and a stupid blatant steven segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it 's the elixir of heaven same coin different sides the movie should be given a one '' no a negative one '' just for the stupid ending but other redeeming factors make it a two '' still not worth seeing unless you 're into infuriating yourself note even my wife and daughter both connousiours hate this have n't checked yet but i think my dogs do too another note these two good actors needed a better movie see ryan in the superb courage under fire '' or the jim morrison movie or when harry met sally '' which i do n't categorize as a chick flick '' but as a good romantic comedy not contrived ||| 0
geez maybe i have a heart of stone i was n't a bit moved by the overrated streep and handsome clint it 's a story about two hearts linked as one a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy bored adults yawwwwn streep can do any accent on the planet and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than marcel marceau that does n't make her an actress just a clever chameleon i 'd rather watch julia roberts play herself over and over and over than see streep play pretend '' roles there i 've said it now goodnight ||| 0
almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree ||| 0
legal eagles '' is supposed to be a comedy we 're supposed to find the characters played by robert redford and debra winger to be amusing their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying the problem is that the movie is too dumb to be taken seriously and thus too dumb to be funny briefly the story takes place in new york robert redford is an assistant district attorney about to be promoted to be the da debra winger is a defense attorney and daryl hannah is a young woman with emotional problems and is debra winger 's client the plot involves a fire 20 years ago when daryl hannah was eight a fire that killed her artist father and purportedly destroyed a large number of his paintings this experience left daryl hannah traumatized but all is not as it seems and now 20 years later daryl hannah is first accused of attempted theft and later of murder unfortunately the plot involves many elements that simply do n't make sense i wo n't go into detail but roger ebert does a good job of listing four different major things that make the plot completely unbelievable as well as the story being dumb i found some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny to be anything but for example robert redford is a weekend father to a teenage daughter at one point his threatens to go to court to prevent him from seeing their daughter robert redford makes a telephone call to his 's home and starts an angry monologue of threats about how he 'll take her apart in court then he realizes that he 's actually talking to his daughter ! this mistake is apparently supposed to be hilarious ha ha in another scene robert redford and debra winger are together and see one of the bad guys robert redford takes off on foot to try to catch him debra winger who does n't know how to drive a car feels it necessary for her to jump into robert redford 's car and try to follow him she makes a wrong turn and finds herself going the wrong way into traffic on a wide heavily trafficked street there follows one minute of her frantically dodging cars at the last moment very funny ha ha ha this movie could have been a fairly good romantic thriller if they had fixed the plot and not tried to be a comedy but the dumb plot and the unfunny attempts at comedy make it a complete waste of time rennie peterse ||| 0

movie it has it 's good parts along with some boring parts but overall good special effects with the ghosts there were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch when a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of many ghosts just a ok movie ||| 0
thirteen ghosts is about a machine this machine was designed by a man who was at the time possessed my satan yes satan if the plot does n't seem stupid enough it needs ghosts to power it ghostbusters anyone at the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a michael j fox movie as time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine ' needs to be powered by ghosts if done right it opens the 'eye to hell ' save yourself a few bucks and do n't rent this it 's awfu ||| 0
i generally like some of these because they 're usually pretty erotic jane fonda 's role in barbarella comes to mind this gwendoline series definitely had the potential what with the theme and the scenes involving gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend but the very beautiful tawney kitaen cast as gwendoline apparently balked at doing scenes this was 1984 after all and so the producers obligingly did n't force her to do any and as a result this one turned into a very bland weak and diluted version of raiders of the lost ark it 's not a good adventure film and it 's certainly not erotic there 's a little nudity and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the french comics but overall this one was a disappointing bust ||| 0
harold ramis 's the ice harvest '' wallows in crime and holiday angst but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires all the ingredients are there but ultimately the movie lacks spice in some movies it works where all the characters move at a slow pace nobody 's fool '' for example but a dark comedy needs some pep and the ice harvest '' does n't have it a lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of john cusack one of my favorite actors he is at his best when he is riffing one of his monologues like in high fidelity '' and say anything '' here cusack 's job is to look morose and make the occasional comment he may speak the fewest lines in any film he 's made as a leading man and that 's a shame billy bob thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes but the menacing actor is for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt the same with the entertaining oliver platt who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone he 's enjoyable but when he 's not there we miss him the bar is set pretty high for movies none of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the spat of the ref '' for example the movie is filled with hoods who all seem or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits instead we get an ominous film that in many ways tries to evoke fargo '' or a simple plan '' but does n't get anywhere close there are a few moments that i wo n't spoil that keep the movie from being a complete waste of time but all in all the movie is a downer and when the winners are finally revealed at the end it feels less like a triumph than it does a conclusion throughout the movie i kept wondering if this would have been a much more enjoyable movie where we got to see what was actually going on inside the minds of the characters there seemed to be many scenes where the actors kept the best lines to themselves petty crime can be highly enjoyable but not in the ice harvest '' ||| 0
long tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog bad plot holes and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from bad boys marcus and mike are out about trying to find some ecstasy they 've been alerted about they get into a bunch of fights a bunch of car chases they get in trouble they argue with each other then they go and they get into another fight then they get in trouble only this time they argue with each other first then they argue with each other then get into a fight then get in trouble then they get into trouble argue with each other and get into a fight the fights the same thing over and over again marcus is upset because he feels his life is in danger mike is upset because he feels marcus is bringing in negative energy they parody relationship therapy there 's another thing happening it 's this cuban antagonist we do n't really care about him really he just kind of runs around being cuban and evil and all then we get to see him get angry at people then he becomes devious then he becomes malicious and angry again so we watch for over two hours with just enough action to keep it moving action that involves a certain camera movement then a reverse shot then the same camera movement then the same reverse shot then the same camera movement then the same reverse shot the only truly interesting action scene occurred in that house with the rastafarians with that spinning camera thing that was pretty clever that 's why this film got any stars at all from me really all i got from this film was the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make the bad boys series if there will ever be one probably into the lethal weapon series i also got a lot of stuff about terrible psychoanalysis which was to me michael bay telling the world that male attraction to action adventure movies is not some weird psychoanalitical crazy mess but just good natured fun which is why the movie got a bit more of a higher rating from me otherwise wow was that tedious polarisdi ||| 0
after 40 minutes of objective viewing and shot after superfluous shot i sat through another 30 minutes in pain i 've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either peter jackson can only do epics wheather it calls for it or not or lotr in all it 's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for jacksons from kong is not an epic it is a tragedy tell me to watch the whole thing if you will but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in i do n't need to on another note jurassic park had better cgi than this jackson no more 'epic shots please ||| 0
eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention but overall the movie displayed poor acting stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot this movie possibly will be owned by many but remembered by few james caan was the only talent that eraser has to offer sorry guys my wife bought it i watched it gave it away and divorced her ||| 0
this movie creeped me out and not in a good way johnny depp is an awesome actor and i usually find him sexy but in this stinker i find him really creepy and gross maybe it 's the michael look he has going on with the black wig and white face could they have picked a more horrible look for ww it looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 wig and 5 clown makup on him ! i love tim burton 's other movies but this one sucked bigtime ! it gives a new perspective on willy wonka but this willy is someone i would keep kids away from this movie is childish if you 're an adult and pales compared to the original if you 're a kid it 's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking auntie zoe what does that mean '' when are screenwriters going to figure it out either write a kids movie or write a grownup movie ! ! ! it 's really hard to do both in the same film it seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids they end up appealing to nobody ! maybe i am biased because i loved the original gene wilder version i would have been open to seeing a remake if it was good but this movie was dissapointing it 's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters the whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i love depp and burton if you are not a fan of either do n't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo ! ||| 0

george sluizer 's original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes ' plot the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration ' but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they do n't even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they 're given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the mood shifts in the couple 's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he 's probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 's end on a joke like a tv cop show ' moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score ca n't do anything for this one ||| 0
joel hershman 's greenfingers '' starring the and utterly gorgeous clive owen and helen mirren is a sweet cutesy and utterly empty british romantic comedy in this forgettable generic inmates at a british prison take up gardening initially they are understandably reluctant to garden but get this gardening ends up changing their lives ! and after his parole owen 's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden ! and mirren 's character is so impressed with the innmates ' gardening that she even has them garden for her ! wow where do people get this stuff of course this being a romantic comedy '' and all there is a romance between owen and mirren 's daughter that is so incredibly forced awkward and contrived that one can not help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other in addition peppered throughout are moments of sentimentality and supposed uplifting moments '' and none of it works for all its good intentions greenfingers '' is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates ' rooms it 's all perfectly decent perfectly inoffensive and perfectly dull ||| 0
the flight into new york had been a long one but i was gently revived when kirsten dunst met me at the airport she was to be my escort that night at the lincoln center where the president would present me the distinguished writer 's highest award this nation can bestow on an author i quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her mercedes s class sedan to the waldorf astoria downtown i have to admit that i did n't you who you were until i read starless grasslands i do n't mean to embarrass you but that book changed my life '' i tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment for the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while i approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile i very much approved of her legs as i departed the car kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes do n't forget i 'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together please be ready '' i expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp the hotel staff greeted me and soon i entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor as i entered the suite the steward took my request to have my suit blushed prepared and returned in a few hours finally a bit of peace i poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below for a few moments i contemplated the remarks i was to make at this evening 's formal ceremonies then i heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room i turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked sandy bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit well crabby are n't you glad to see me '' before i could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right it was jennifer aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit sweetheart do n't look at her come here to me '' get out ! '' screamed sandy no you get out it 's not fair i left brad for him so i get him ! '' the two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment then sandy leapt at jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other it was a ferocious sight as pulled hair shrieks of pain and nylon tearing could be heard then almost a quickly as it began the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor sandy marched back into the room victorious i ran to the door of the sitting room only to see jennifer laid out on the floor out cold spread eagle and naked before i could think of what to do sandy tapped me on my shoulder i turned around and there sandy stood a little worse for wear trying to catch her breath nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet forget her she wo n't bother us now '' sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume she posed standing and anticipating my admiration now i 'm all sweaty and warm i need a shower '' sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond i turned around and wondered what i should do for poor jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor then i heard sandy calling crabby why do n't you come and help me you could soap up my '' oops ! ! ! ! sorry ! ! ! err just a little fantasy of mine i meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over i swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here you see the cover of this dvd displays bullock prominently with her name in big font letters but in truth this movie focuses on tate donovan as the main character and only on bullock as his unlikely love interest as much as i love '' sandra bullock i have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her her best films have been while you were sleeping wrestling ernest hemingway and the hope floats unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like fire on the amazon hangman speed 2 and this movie the plot revolves around two losers in love '' who are unappealing both in looks and personality donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman an unrecognizable anne bancroft and soon both donovan and bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet all goes well until others find out their secret and donovan and bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other the story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet chances are you can find a copy of this dvd fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you 're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off your friends to wake up from their you can really do something worth wild ||| 0
someone bought this dvd for my almost 5 year old daughter we thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were however within minutes of the movie 's beginning my daughter was in tears i wo n't say why but she found the plot frightening several times during the movie i tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end fortunately the movie is relatively short overall i found the story to be a cynical look at christmas as an adult i think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of christmas shopping but i urge caution before showing it to young children there was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of christmas ||| 0

it is unusual that i disagree with so many great critics praising a movie where there is so much talent this movie tries to deal with alot and does alot of it well but as a viewer i am hugely distracted by mamet 's dialogue no i do not agree that people in the real business world talk like this ! real people do not mindlessly echo over and over and over the same phrases that they hear each other speaking if i did that in my working environment my coworkers would think there was something wrong with me real conversation does not run in that kind of patter after listening to the characters for ninety minutes i finally came to the conclusion that many of the characters sounded alike and the one connection point was mamet real people talk differently from each other they use different and distinct speech patterns and phrases and slang i 've had this problem with mamet before and i ca n't believe nobody has ever noticed this before and i would doubt that i am the first i would n't be surprised if somewhere some actor in some mamet production has pondered this before come on ! good dialogue is like good acting if it 's really good you do n't notice it until the show 's over ||| 0
what a disappointment ! i remember siskel and ebert raving over this romantic comedy romantic maybe but comedy never very predictable plot from beginning to end and rosie perez was truly offensive a few times i could n't understand what she was saying there is no way i could buy that she and cage 's character were attracted to each other maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex violence or rough language although cage does get shot in one scene it was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way i am beginning to like cage more and more as he ages spoiler i was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners either they should n't have changed it so much or they should n't have let us know about the real story it was based on end of spoiler but fonda and cage were very engaging together ||| 0
this is a review of the ultimate collector 's edition '' not a review of the film itself if you 're considering the purchase of a special edition you probably already know that the film is great you just want to know if this slick package is worth the pricetag in short it 's not and let me be absolutely clear about one thing i have known and loved this film for years a few sequences look properly spectacular but after watching this dvd on two separate and televisions i 'm amazed that all of the scenes have been rendered almost completely dark like too dark to tell what 's even for instance the scene where brad harry carey runs off to his death the scene where marty 's jeffrey hunter 's bride '' is serving coffee along the river and even the scenes leading up to the final storming of the comanche camp are utterly lost in the dark by contrast the 1997 dvd release features noticeably richer colors in the daytime scenes and total clarity in the scenes i 've just mentioned do n't waste your money on this special edition you 'll be much happier if you just shell out the 10.99 for the 1997 release ||| 0

do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity if you do you are in for a fall both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining this one has no such pretensions it is merely boring the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town 's folk out of their claims they do this through intimidation and violence when a couple of friends get hold of a claim they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys to do this they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction they yell they fight they wrestle they shoot and then they do it some more its not very exciting cinema this production is made worse by the dvd i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair the dvd however is of such low quality that who could really tell the edges are clipped off the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it it was not worth the effort spaghetti westerns can be fun this one however needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn ||| 0
this movie isnt worth the time to read this review it sucks and i 'm a big trinity fan my advice is keep searchin ||| 0
this is the worst asian movie that i have ever seen the story is dumb and does n't make any sense especially the ending and to top it off it is n't that scary it only gets a little bit scary at the end my recommendation do n't get this movie it is also too expensive it you want to watch a good asian horror movie i have lots of recommendations wishing stairs is pretty good koma is an excellent movie a tale of two sisters is pretty good good luck ||| 0
if this movie was ever going to have a chance it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long or never attempted in the first place some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay possession just ca n't be dealt with that way what you have as a result is another story entirely there just was n't time enough i guess to develop the characters or even to include half of them the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating and we are left with painful stereotypes and in the case of roland michell a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming my best advice is that if you 've read the book skip the movie but if you saw the movie you should do yourself a favor and get the book ||| 0
why release wrestlemaina 's that are already on dvd anther thing wrestlemaina is months away it was a perfect time to release the big four in order survivor series entire series then royal rumble then wrestlemaina and finally summerslam made sense but wwe really doesnt think well sometimes ||| 0
well this dvd is pretty bad like everyone else said it 's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14 with narration from each character in the background i believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they were n't getting high ratings on the anime series anyway i did n't buy this dvd because i have the japanese box set instead which saved me a lot of i watched each episode and i must say the only part i liked was the opening and ending theme other than that there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a wolf 's rain fan but do n't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window i really highly recommend renting this before you buy it cause otherwise you are wasting your money ||| 0
what really bothered me about hudsucker proxy capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone even communist slaves and fascist toady 's under a democratic people yet hollywood insists on blasting corporate culture when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest they are exemplary so much hollywood talent and money wasted on a bad idea so what else is new the coen 's have jumped the shark with this take off of the american screwball comedy of the 30 's i cringed every time jennifer jason leigh tried to imitate katharine hepburn 's classic gargle the poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker i ca n't stand tim robbin 's politics but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies he almost carries this farce paul newman however is collecting a check he 's been collecting checks since the 50 's his salad dressing stinks too i 'm amazed at how much money the coen 's command in hollywood on such flimsy pitches i loved fargo and enjoyed the big lebowski not as much as some cult fans but this film why did they bother ||| 0
i bought this back in october of 2006. can someone who bought it more recently tell me if the sound issues have been fixed i returned this item for a refund and wo n't be buying it again until paramount fixes the sound issues parts of the show are very quiet i had to turn the sound up to even make out the dialog then a loud part comes on and almost blows my speakers this happens multiple times per episode repeat this for six hours if i wanted this kind of quality i 'd just download the episodes off the internet there will be a gap in my collection until this is fixed i do n't know why they ca n't pay someone 5.15 an hour to watch the dvd once before they make 10 million copies ||| 0
trying to make a film concerning studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea it 's just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on from what i understand the original director 's cut was gutted by miramax before the film was released it and it shows other than mike meyers portrayal of steve rubell there 's hardly a gay character in sight there 's some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel anyone with a taste for fine filmmaking need not bother with this cinematic mistake ||| 0
i guess when any era becomes old enough for the nostaglia craze '' to hit we get to see what exagerations get stretched to the point of lying case in point the 1950 's were not such an innocent age and the 1970 's were not that wild studio 54 and the disco era in general were about freedom great music great people watching and in general having a hell of a goodtime for the brief period that it ruled the music charts disco broke down barriers and the stars of certain musical genres were able to crossover i often call 1979 the year that music got close to the light '' my big issue with this movie is that it failed to show that for many of us we took advantage of the liberation of disco 's like 54 and enjoyed ourselves it was glamorous it was over the top and it was fun amazing as it seems many of us did not inhail cocaine like air and for some of us who did indulge we did not become adicts or for that matter guilt ladden clubs like studio 54 were great palaces that broke down many barriers and helped us escape the many issues facing the nation in the late 70 's too bad this movie did not convey it ||| 0
wow what a bore the old stock footage is uneven and does n't show enough of the truck other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street the song is ok but once that 's over my son walks away why would a child who loves trucks walk away because some guy 's voice which sounds like it 's in an echo chamber comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he ca n't see on the screen what 's on the screen more garbage stock footage this looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone 's basement ||| 0
i own several real wheels movies and thought i would give this one a shot i found the picture quality to be less than i expected and the footage seemed out of date the narration was dull and boring and the children 's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying i would recommend any of the real wheels series instead of this they never fail to please my 3 year old truck lover ||| 0
i 'm of the opinion that king 's books rarely translate well into movies and this is no exception some of king 's work is fantastic but unfortunately a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new this falls into the latter category a novel about a novelist and one who has a hard time finding inspiration please king which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from the writer 's ideas showing up in real life from whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth i wo n't bother to tell you the ending because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie you 'll have already guessed it by the time you 're half way through it 's all bad and hackneyed from start to finish i will give steven king credit for putting his fame to good use though if anyone without king 's fame and fan base tried to sell a story this trite their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the gunslinger series but it does n't mean that we have to watch them ||| 0
filming the story of gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio from warner brothers to bbc the virgin queen still retains her power to enthrall intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne she was perhaps england 's last true absolute monarch and certainly one of its greatest if not most famous since the advent of film she has been one of the most coveted roles to play indeed few monarchs have been so closely chronicled save perhaps her own father henry viii and victoria she has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses sarah bernhardt bette davis judi dench judith anderson miranda richardson flora robson cate blanchett helen mirren even quentin crisp and most famously and importantly glenda jackson and it must be said without doubt that glenda jackson 's elizabeth r '' is the defining portrait the most accomplished historically accurate and masterfully acted glenda jackson is elizabeth i reincarnate there is simply none better and likely never will be so now we have duff in the red wig for 230 masterpiece theatre minutes perhaps for the sake of revisionists we are offered a far less imperious monarch one who is both reactive the real one was and passive the real one was not duff is an odd choice no beauty like cate blanchett but elizabeth was known for vanity not beauty duff 's elizabeth with quivering lip and watercolor behavior seems filmed underwater and make for an undesirable monarch certainly not the gloriana of myth or fact where is her famous wit her coy manipulations her strong moral fiber her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers left with glenda jackson i suppose this elizabeth is a simpering maiden or a crass hag and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance hag works crass manages simpering loses the whole impact a suavely elegant very attractive and distinctly healthy queen mary i opens elizabeth 's story no catharine parr no thomas seymour no childhood but is quickly dispatched just as well for she 's thoroughly mary was none of those things far better was the wonderful kathy burke in the blanchett version though she was a bit of a protestant caricature daphne slater in the jackson series was far more appealing and perfectly written elizabeth 's transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life no part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years the abuse by seymour imprisonment exile and finally her accession unfortunately much of this key period is sped through the fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast elizabeth mooning incessantly over robert dudley later earl of leicester here played by a childish petulant tom hardy there is no chemistry here he is pretty but vacant glenda jackson 's dudley robert hardy no relation that i know of is a bit of a fop but he knows his place in court and elizabeth 's heart their chemistry is clear this version of dudley is a bit ridiculous how he would claim the queen 's heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance so is most of the casting what 's with the acrobat an egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by dudley 's wife amy robsart whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery more time should have been spent on the wooing of elizabeth by the french duc d'alencon who very nearly came to be her husband again the 1971 glenda jackson version handles this segment masterfully all too soon and without sufficient explanation we become immersed in the historically key battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous mary queen of scots elizabeth 's cousin granddaughter of henry viii 's older sister margaret whose claim to the english throne made her a rallying point of catholics and a very real threat to elizabeth it was mary 's son james who succeeded elizabeth in 1603 founding the house of stuart far more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of mary queen of scots which was elizabeth 's darkest hour forever bloodying her saintly propaganda likewise more attention should have been given to walshingham elizabeth 's master of subversion although william cecil lord burghley is given fair due the decisive armada happens much too quickly lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of elizabeth and robert devereaux earl of essex portrayed by hans matheson who is cast and directed as a bipolar mama 's boy '' a very strange oedipal twist here whose hair look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585. the entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling the casting is awful the acting mediocre the personality baffling this essex is a wreck blame the revisionist director two significant annoyances elizabeth 's duff 's accent is n't simply london which would be fine but stands in stark contrast to everyone else 's appropriate english diction and clarity she comes off as a guttersnipe and worse of all distracting to the utmost is the incessant soundtrack that dominates and not pleasantly the action and plot of the movie the sheer volume of it is horrendous to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with essex 's electric guitar my suggestion here is to rent this one watch it as long as you can and then return to davis blanchett jackson or even dench overall a disappointment were it not for 95 historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes plus the decent acting most of the problems are the director 's fault do n't blame the actors it would have earned one star but this queen is no legend and this cast is horrendous an inglorious gloriana ||| 0
as much as i like paul newman this movie is very disappointing once you 've seen the film day one '' the portrayal of oppenheimer and groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people the movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the manhatten project be sure to see day one '' if you are interested in this and give this film a miss ||| 0

to be fair the legends of herakles as they were originally written have little to do with this movie but maybe that 's for the best having grown up on superman batman and the justice league i have a hard time calling a person like herakles a hero in the original legends he was a warrior but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage he also was n't as far as i can tell as strong as in this version therefore interpretations of herakles are i think to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend but on where and why disney has attempted to take herakles or hercules in the roman and make it a story about a true hero and a perfect one at that there 's nothing i like more than perfect heroes they inspire me conceptually i like the idea instead of herakles being the illegitimate son of zeus and a mortal woman he 's conceived in love by zeus and hera and turned mortal by a potion not bad as changes go it works better than most herc meets meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him another deviation from the legend and a very good improvement of course because hera is his mother in this version she ca n't be herc 's enemy so they make his opponent hades lord of the dead which could be worse as changes go i 've never seen hades as being all that bad of a guy but that 's how it goes then there 's the hydra which is if anything much larger and more powerful than it was originally so that 's good too aside from this however i have to say i was disappointed with most of the changes the titans to start with were underplayed considerably it might have been premature to mention that they were zeus ' predecessors but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had and a appearance oceanus for example lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose or cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence particularly since hercules did n't beat the titans alone in the original stories nor does it make sense that he should in this one grabbing a whirlwind come on now i actually did n't mind hades ' demeanor all that much though i did n't see a reason why he should have powers when that 's clearly apollo 's territory further i thought most of the gods and muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature why is this the case i think disney made the mistake in this film of not just trying to make the legends clean but fun as well and there 's nothing fun about war i 'm not saying they could n't have made the concept work in fact i 'm saying they could have made it work if they 'd toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect justice league style still for what it 's worth this is one of the few movies left in the world that is n't afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero and for that it 's worth at least one viewing rent it from your local video store in my opinion before you make your decision ||| 0

this is the first time i have ever purchased a the firm '' dvd i was really disappointed in this one many of the moves are not properly explained some movements target only one side of the body and they do n't bother having you switch sides to work the other really obvious in the salsa style section it took a few times of doing to get all the moves right but even after that it barely raises the heart rate the warm up leaves much to be desired the cool down continues the dance '' movements but at a slower '' rate and stretching the neck for one second on each side and the inner thigh for one second here and those are not enough to even make you realize that you are stretching i am used to denise austin workouts that are half the length but you actually feel like you did something when you are done not so with this workout '' at all definately a waste for someone who is n't just starting out ||| 0

i have been a huge fan of montgomery 's work since i was an old girl living in the caribbean i 've read and and her stories again and again and ca n't seem to get enough the first two film installments in the anne of green gables story are warm beautiful funny inspiring and moving pieces of work that are more or less faithful to montgomery 's original novels the third installment is a travesty anachronism bad dialogue bad plot and plain old bad acting plague this sequel '' i say sequel '' in quotes because the thing i dislike the most about the movie is the fact that the storyline is a complete departure from what montgomery had envisioned for anne so long ago what a way to end it that said i 've decided to purchase only the first two installments and leave the third alone i prefer to have anne and gilbert live out their literary lives in my imagination than to poison my memory of them with the drivel that is anne of green gables the continuing story ||| 0

ok i 've only just seen this film for the first time so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect but this is not a particularly good film i mean it has its choice moments where it really comes together the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed any scene with is almost guaranteed classic status samuel jackson 's in it and if you 're a fan of dave chapelle 's tyrone biggums crackhead character the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his similarity but that 's really my problem with this film serious issues are reduced to a series of archetypes straight out of central casting and they 're all here the homey black grandparents the nation of islam convert the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine 's road all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth take the french film 'la haine ' for instance it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society boyz n tha hood but its characters actually feel tormented instead of just having lots of scenes written for them to show their torment rather than just running through a laundry list of problems it really gets to the heart of something bigger some grander alienation that urban youths feel which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do plus if you can believe it the in 'la haine ' is quite a bit better so while i would definitely recommend seeing this film keep the remote aimed and ready finger on the button maybe about a of this film is really worth watching whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising oh yeah and there 's a really sex scene thrown in for no particular reason oh also the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees in a film that did n't try to carry so much social weight that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking but it really just cheapens this one ||| 0
the kit was not worth its price the spatial effect is poor i 've been watching some much better movies with much cheaper paper glasses no i do n't have visual problem and i rigged up everything correctly the dvds itself were not interesting my kids were not impressed much it were not made me happier with the pack sorry this review seems against the others but it is my truth i 've stored it back into the box i do n't recommend this for you ||| 0
for months disney advertised this as a special edition dvd but at the last minute that second disc mysteriously disappeared why this is false advertising and if i had my way disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands it 's unfair to force people who really want a to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the uk and to those of us who do n't own a player they did this same crap to alice in wonderland but the other way around uk lost a disc that we have and paramount and fox have done this to us fans of titanic by dropping the editions in the us but not in the uk and giving fans in the us a edition i do n't understand why these movie companies ca n't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world unfortunately i have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a special edition '' dvd i do not appreciate being lied to i still love disney movies as well as the excellent dvd editions when disney actually releases the product they 've advertised for months and i will continue to buy the quality dvd releases but i do not enjoy false advertisement ||| 0
this movie was so boring and stupid i turned it off after about 45 minutes maybe i had a poor copy but i could barely understand what paula prentiss was saying and it was n't because she was under the influence ! '' i ran it back a few times but still could n't make it out from the other reviewers it sounds like it got better but if something does n't grab my attention after 30 minutes i say forget it ||| 0
i loved the original movie and i love johnny depp so i thought this movie would be wrong wrong ! ! first of all the child actors were horrible well the charlie and mike characters were ok but the two girl actors were the worst i 've seen in a long time and what did they do to johnny depp he was so creepy and weird i took my nine year old to see it in the theater and even she almost fell asleep if you really want a treat watch the original with gene wilder ||| 0
i found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time it 's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning the ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion denzel washington did a great job playing the detective and john goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted my recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money buy somthing that has a good plot is my ratin ||| 0
i practically fell asleep while watching this tape the girl doing the exercises is n't even saying anything while she 's doing it it 's a voice over ! also she 's all alone in a blank room all the exercises are basically the same i would suggest mtv pilates it 's a lot more fun ||| 0
i bought this dvd to replace a worn video from the bbc british broadcasting commission it was a bit of a shock the original film has been edited and chopped up with bits of rubbish added through it also now has a poor voice over the whole feel of the film has been removed all the pbs and viewers like your rubbish where 'd that come from it was totallly funded via the bbc the pbs editions mess up may have been funded by someone else my copy is going free as i wo n't be watching it again sincerely do yourself a favour and source out a bbc edition i give it 5 stars it is an awesome package inspiring and well told something to watch again and again hence i 've worn out the video cassette ||| 0
opened the sealed dvd case and get shorty was inside and not the usual suspects i sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement i got a credit i think not sure i would rather just have the correct movie ||| 0
i really want to give this piece of garbage a zero actually i only watched part of one episode i do n't know if it 's from season one i am a columbo fan and a detective writer i saw a sniper shoot a man on a platform the platform was almost located right up against a building the sniper was in ! a toilet with flowers in it he reacts to colds i saw a classroom full of kids every one had a cold ! not very realistic kiddie video game pacing with no proper build up they do n't make stuff for intelligent people anymore ! if you are new to this series watch some before you buy maybe some of it is ok ||| 0
some idiot edited this and put two bars on the top and bottom that are part of the video so in you watch this on a laptop or widescreen tv you will also get two bars on this side this means that when you view it it takes up about of the screen with four black bars taking up most of the screen i could not even watch 5 minutes of this complete trash ||| 0
the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor but there 's no mystery ||| 0
honestly nothing about this show grabs me i 'm surprised this show gets such high nielsen ratings every week the writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time but the biggest flaw is the acting it is really laughable me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be horatio caine talks in a slow drawl all the time saying the stupidest and most obvious things calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating none of the team displays any emotion whatsoever oh except horatio when he over does it the stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable if there 's a suspect with a history '' with horatio yup you guessed it he 's involved either directly or indirectly and also if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show yea it 's not him and calleigh gets evidence '' such as dna from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality i mean once or twice is alright but i 've seen about episodes and she does it all the time every criminal here is an idiot they are sure to leave all kinds of huge clues '' leading to them or their alliances and every crime gets solved all the time oh and is it just me or does the team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips no need for books or researching they already have it that big brain of theirs think that 's unlikely exactly my point in short i would n't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show in fact even if someone gives me this dvd set as a gift i would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else watch this show if you 're really bored with nothing else to do and no better use of your time if you want real crime scene investigation watch the original las vegas that 's the best ||| 0

i 'm a fan of the 1999 the mummy '' and was understandably looking forward to this sequel in the summer of 2001 i went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and we just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium it 's a curious thing that too much action and in a film can be boring it may not seem logical but it 's true and the mummy returns '' is exibit i recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so i decided to it after over five years yet after a mere minutes i was again completely detached from the picture even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on or at least things that should have been exciting the mummy returns '' has a lot going for it a great cast locations costumes cinematography etc in addition it has a great indiana jones appeal unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement what went wrong simply put no substance the mummy returns '' abandons the characters and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and sequences final analysis the mummy returns '' has so many ingredients right but it somehow utterly fails it 's unadulterated cinematic junk it should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance having all the right elements including budget and stupefyingly fumbling the ball needless to say this could have been a great film franchise but it was not to be returns '' put an end to that ||| 0
charlize theron her real life boyfriend stuart townsend and penelope cruz are all nice to look at and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work theron having won as osca for her role in monster but head in the clouds is one of those beautifully filmed films starring a beautiful cast that trying to stay beautiful in an increasingly ugly world particularly europe in the from the spanish civil war to world war ii the stories of these three people who share a paris flat together is supposed to be a sweeping tragedy that shows how world events and fate can conspire to thwart true love instead it shows how silly things can be when you mix hedonism narcissism social responsbility and sheer stupidity you end up caring less about the characters andwondering more how much more trouble will they get themselves in this was a pretty stylish waste of time for everyone involved ||| 0
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen no real plot and acting is as bad as it can get not even samuel jackson 's appearance saves this sorry excuse for a movie horrible awful ||| 0
i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern 's classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp 's performance '' is chock full of ticks and mannerisms flat and finally rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton 's film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton 's part that does n't make the final product any more watchable it 's one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton 's other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with could care less about the final result is a film that 's like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio ||| 0
this movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have ever seen as a huge colin firth fan originally from a small town in vermont i thought that no matter what i had heard about the film i would enjoy it unfortunately i was wrong the main problem of the film was characterization there were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character 's actions one minute the small town girl played by heather graham is working at a nursing home then she 's downing alcohol then she 's jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason in fact she does n't even seem drunk and all this entices the character colin firth to jump into bed with her i think the heather graham character is supposed to be quirky but because of the script and the way the film is cut she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance and this is no rebound relationship basically the movie continues along this vein with minnie driver showing up as the british who you ca n't see ever having had a relationship with colin both actors are better in the much superior movie circle of friends in any case there are many more unexplained actions and wierd back togethers before the movie thankfully ends additionally the setting is completely misused beginning with the sign that says more than people live in hope in new england that does not classify as a small town they could have used the autumn setting and of the people as restorative to the colin character the suggestion of that is there but it is never demonstrated instead they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the heather graham character downs a bottle of booze and colin firth 's character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town 's people although the hotel owners are fun if unrealistic the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character finally i do n't neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie with the wierd cutting it may have seemed like a good idea at the time i think colin firth does his best at being an ambigious but still likeable guy heather graham aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all has absolutely nothing to work with so you ca n't even blame her for the horrendous character she has and everyone else including minnie driver is a complete caricature although minnie driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film i feel bad to judge this movie so harshly but it is unneccessarily bad and i had been hoping for something at least fun these actors all have much better movies out there ||| 0
here 's the awful truth '' that you would be willing to let this man a raving terminally obese incoherent highschool dropout who is to truth what a lead block smeared with ketchup is to cheesecake you would let this man literally plunge his stained mitts into your skull forming the mushy stuff of your brain into little foamy pink chunks of liberal pabulum and that you would pay him money to render the service ! yes you could watch all of the episodes in the awful truth '' you would no doubt feel smug and superior to all those unenlightened troglodytes who voted for bush you might giggle a bit which is a common of a political lobotomy but at the end of the day it is far better that you take your lead from antiquity when oedipus realized his own version of the awful truth '' he had whacked pa gotten jiggy with ma and generally made an of himself stabbed out his own eyeballs might i recommend the iron pokers js ||| 0
i preface all of my dvd reviews with the following note there are more than enough film reviews on and quite frankly it 's a bit ridiculous a person can scroll through of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the dvd if you want to review or discuss a film go to imdb if you 're reviewing the dvd speak to the qualities or lack thereof of the audio and video mention your opinions of the plot acting etc but please do n't write an essay ! now on to my review of the ghost and the darkness on dvd i remember wanting to see this movie when i was younger when it was first released but it was n't until my sophomore year of college that i bought the dvd in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history in terms of hollywood it 's fairly accurate the film itself as entertainment is great it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary i 'm a fan of both douglas and kilmer they 're fine here but they 've definitely done better work elsewhere the plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense additionally the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great too now the bad news the dvd sucks period and i 'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here the transfer is absolutely criminal and those responsible for it should never work on another dvd project ever again the print is clear and solid but the aspect ratio is not correct at all i was mortified when i popped it into my player only to be rewarded with a distorted image absolutely shameful this film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio video audio a film b ||| 0
i did not much enjoy this film and i did n't find it very clever or funny it 's true as other amazon reviewers have noted that citizen ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue does that make it an intelligent and comic treatment of a complex topic no indeed along the way it also stereotypes poor people middle class people teenagers drug addicts christians and vietnam veterans that does n't make it funny though because the satire is so and predictable simply tackling an important social topic like abortion is n't going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor in my opinion the film 's pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy there were too many of earnest and angry faces and burt reynolds as the national leader of the crowd was just peculiar what was he doing in this film and what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young eric laura dern is a talented actress and she does a creditable job with this part which because it straddles genres was a challenging one but her talent could n't redeem this film for me ||| 0
i have never been a demi moore fan but this movie is even worse than i imagined it would be my kids picked it up in the videotheque i decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them demi 's acting is rather passionless poor and disconnected she looks old too ! she does n't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too after just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in scotland to write a new novel yeah sure that 's what i would do after losing my only child i probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so after five minutes you do n't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her you can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen and all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly a guy who is alone on an island for years who does n't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it and who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly a mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere i expected a film with supernatural elements but boy did i get fooled some of the photography and scenery was acceptable but the cgi generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly alas not a film that i can recommend to anyone ||| 0
half light craig rosenberg 2006 i 've been following some heated debate about this flick on movie boards and it 's brought a somewhat related if tangentially point into focus for me why it is that movies like darkness the 2002 spanish thriller '' with all the suspense of a pee wee herman monologue and haute tension france 's painfully bad 2005 attempt at horror come over to america and fall flat well i knew the answer but really you 're all providing me with more evidence you 've never seen a good horror film in your life have you because that 's really the only way i can see justifying darkness haute tension or half light as marginal much less good movies demi moore plays rachel carlson an american author living in scotland with her husband brian henry ian cusick and their son thomas the beans recently in the tv adaptation of beneath the skin thomas suffers a household accident which leads to rachel and brian splitting up rachel 's friend sharon coupling 's kate isitt finds sharon a lovely secluded place on the coast to hole up and try to write and why is it that dead kids always lead to parents going off somewhere secluded where they 're bound to be tormented by guilt rachel meets a number of fine locals including angus mcculloch the mists of avalon 's hans matheson keeper of an even more secluded lighthouse not far from her new place with whom she feels an instant attraction despite being free of the marriage bond rachel 's not quite sure what to make of her handsome stranger and neither are we there 's obviously supposed to be chemistry between these two characters but it 's never realized it 's probably off looking for the film 's suspense which rosenberg reminds us we 're supposed to be feeling by inserting a few scenes that tread the ground of every suspense movie in the entire book once you 've figured out the movie 's big twists yes there 's more than one handled with all the delicacy afforded to say a road being repaved which you will have done less than thirty minutes into the film rosenberg attempts to hit you with another big twist at the end there 's only one problem the movie 's climactic scene is so befuddling that any attempt at inserting another plot twist that leads to the film 's resolution does nothing but leave the viewer confused and unsatisfied go look at the film boards in various places there is one question that crops up over and over again it relates to the utter inability of the climax to get its point across it 's not often that i say darkness is better than another horror film after all darkness was about the most pointless exercise in mediocrity possible but if you have died and gone to hell and you have a choice of which of the two to watch on endless loop for the rest of eternity darkness should be a yes this one 's that bad ||| 0
i 've owned the laserdisc version of new order story '' for 5 years and watch parts of it at least once a week so i thought having the dvd version would be an upgrade not at all it 's a cheap transfer from laserdisc the dvd containing a collection '' has defects in it i mainly bought it so i could have the full version of the promo for the perfect kiss '' in story '' is almost ruined by bono 's horrible but it turns out it has a huge skip in the dvd version i did n't even care to test the rest of the disc and just returned it ||| 0
the editor decided that i do n't want to see how the plane crashes into wtc or how people jump from windows so he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else instead there is a plenty of news people 's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking and why do i care plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left ||| 0

absolute dog poop with corn so there is this joke that all the comedians know about and there are a million ways to tell it and they get really raunchy there that 's the movie i saved you two hours oh but there 's a kicker the joke is n't funny and everyone knows it yet of course some of the comedians tell it like it 's the funniest thing in the world sarah silverman gilbert godfried bob sagat and south park are definite highlights and i love sarah silverman however the awful cinematography horrific editing and terrible production value of this film make impossible for me to fathom why people did n't burn down the theaters when they realized this film was n't getting any better i would have at least demanded a refund and billed in 15 minute increments i think sarah silverman saved the day again ||| 0
so i 'm supposed to believe that the horrible dialogue bad acting and ridiculous plotting is on purpose just because mamet is a respected guy how about we call a dog a dog and just move on ||| 0
this show is my all time favorite however universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser and a wrong season premier intro ! dvd is meant to bring out the best in media not the worst how could they lose sound effects unbelievable ! just does n't seem possible season 4 is no better universal please read this and season 3 and 4 already the fans are extremely pissed off ! ||| 0
this documentary is poorly produced has terrible sound quality and stereotypical life affirming '' stories there was nothing in here to support their business practices or their philosophy ||| 0
first of all i am a joy division and new order fan therefore i tried to like this really i did sadly this film stinks the focus is not on the bands themselves but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson what a monster ! either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life maybe i 'm not british but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny only a few scenes made me grin the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film in addition the camera work was very jerky looked like it was done by a novice and yes i 'm one myself having made two movies the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division too bad the members of this band are minor characters i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much much better ||| 0
i 'm very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does i suppose most are simply glad the show is available on dvd however the transfer to dvd is absolutely horrible on an opening night shot on disc 1 there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs inside the house ! the colors on these prints are n't even as good as what is shown on tvland this show might be 30 years old but they can not be using the best prints available there is another irritating of the cheapness of this package the music on the closing credits is wrong or is this my imagination for those who are defending this package the upcoming daniel boone dvd set is a good item to compare it with that show aired in 1966 and the remastered print is fantastic studios and companies can do a good job when they choose to it 's a real shame that in this age of tvs this program will look so shoddy it 's apparent that with such a popular show they could have recouped the investment ||| 0
first let me say that i thought angela 's ashes was an absolutely terrific book and frank mccourt fully deserved his pulitzer prize this movie was a horrendous let down no one involved with the film seemed to have a clue about how to depict real deprivation and poverty everything was a hollywood version of suffering and misery from emily watson 's pretty red coat standing in for the real angela 's gray rag to the beautifully lit irish streets and of course john let me tell you how you 're supposed to feel right now '' williams ' cloying inappropriate music the acting from the children was great they were absolutely the best part of the film of course given the constraints of film and the average audience tolerance for unpleasantness such as oozing eyes pimples and bad teeth all the kids were pleasing to look at clear skinned and attractive at least they could act ! emily watson was given little to do robert carlyle was good although alan parker seemed determined to sanitize the ambiguities of mccourt 's father by only showing little episodes of drunkeness and thoughtlessness parker tends to be an extremely literal director with little understanding of subtlety look what he did in the pink floyd 's the wall '' this time he was clearly given a mandate by the hollywood bigwig producers not to make the film too depressing '' or grim '' so that audiences would accept it the film ends up being a choppy gentrified soulless version of one of the best modern books ever written really a shame and a waste of resources ||| 0
this is a made for tv movie and not the original film do not waste your money on this buy the original that was released in 1967 and starred robert blake ||| 0

i ca n't give it any less than one star but what the heck the girls were hot so there 's the one star other than that i am literally dumber after watching this movie ! i swear to god ! i passed out after watching this film because i got so stupid i forgot to breathe ! they should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job ! even if they just ran around the set yelling potato salad march !

i love chazz and i can see why he would want to give the other side of the castellano epic but man is this movie boring castellano has to be one of the most uninvolved mobsters ever to take the reins of a crime family if you know the history of this guy than you should agree and if you do n't read some books about him as powerful as he was he sure did n't know much about running a crime family as did his predecessors which this film does n't portray the film also has terrible actors portraying both sammy the bull and john gotti an insult at that if you like mafia movies and do n't care about the history of its characters than by all means watch it if you do skip it you 'd be better off reading a book ||| 0
to violent for anyone ! this movie is horrible the cast is good but the plot stinks ! its just this family who have super powers then this kid wanted to be incredibles side kick in a way incredible says no so then he hates him then the kid turns evil and kills people and wants every body to like him thats origanal there are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes and there is way to much violence killing guns punching bombs and they say stupid words sometimes i do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence so i do not recommend this movie to anyone especially the 2 disc special edition ! ||| 0
well what can i say about this movie well one thing is it was n't what i 'd expected those who 'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but i still wanted to see it i was wrong and they were right the movie is about a zebra named marty who wants to go to wild ' bring in a lion called alex who is self obsessed a hippo named gloria who is overprotective and a giraffe named melman who need psychiatric care marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to ' him but four get pinned in manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to africa along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps and get stranded in madagascar meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs that 's basically the whole movie in a nutshell the group fight alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat end of story the entire look of the animation was terrible as well they should have continued with shrek 3 instead of making this movie it 's pointless to watch the most interesting thing in the entire dvd was the christmas caper ' which was n't the short movie itself but the man who played patrick from spongebob squarepants is the polar bear for those of you planning to buy this dvd stay away it 's a huge rip off it 's just something to keep you waiting for shrek 3 ||| 0
being a huge fan of sandra bullock i bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work nope this movie is garbage first thing i noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots the acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous over all it 's not a movie worth buying ||| 0

it is unfair to judge a children 's film by the same standards you would judge a film made for a more mature audience that said i had a difficult time figuring out the intended target audience for disney '' s a far off place '' an odd mix of alaska '' walkabout '' and blue lagoon '' since each of these films had a different target audience children for alaska '' adults for walkabout '' and teens for blue lagoon '' a far off place '' suffers from a poorly matched and confused mix of story elements the attempt to appeal to multiple target audiences ultimately makes it unappealing to all audiences despite some positive comments on this database a far off place '' did not impress audiences at the time of its 1993 release and has generated little interest since based on stories by south african writer laurens van der post a far off place '' is the story of three teenagers nonnie reece witherspoon as a girl raised on south african game preserve harry ethan randall as a visiting american boy and sorel bok as their young bushman guide xhabbo who attempt to evade a gang of ivory poachers by fleeing into the kalahari desert ethan randall is actually ethan embry from ca n't hardy wait '' although recommended for ages eight and up most younger viewers will be deeply disturbed by the early scenes where the family 's idyllic life is ended by a night attack on their home by the poachers the house is burned and the parents are murdered and more mature viewers will be deeply disturbed by the next scene where nonnie turns into rambo and kills most of gang in a sequence credible only to a horrified old at this point it begins to look like walkabout '' a story of an australian girl her little brother and a young aborigine on his ritual journey to manhood in a significant deviation from the book xhabbo 's wife does not accompany the group into the desert walkabout 's '' more adult theme of interracial sexual awakening is replaced by a blue lagoon '' romance between the two white teenagers a reflection of the film 's narrower values and more modest ambitions the scenes shot in the desert are almost the equal of alaska '' for scenic beauty but alaska '' s '' more realistic survival challenges are superior to the blend of survival skills and mystic powers that xhabbo demonstrates to his two companions during their journey there is an element of the gods must be crazy '' in this clash of cultures but the film does not go very far bad pun intended with the concept both alaska '' and a far off place '' insert the element of poacher violence into the journey to the detriment of the basic story 'walkabout '' did not need this and found sufficient story material in the enormity of the survival experience bok is excellent as the young bushman and 's performance is solid if unexceptional those interested in witherspoon 's early work would be better served checking out her great debut performance in the man in the moon '' and avoiding this career misstep those looking for a story should stick with alaska '' then again what do i know i 'm only a child ||| 0
well this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get unfortunately the female teenage protagonist played by witherspoon whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here acts masculine and heroic the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant at one ridiculous point the girl runs around acting like a commando a veritable army blowing up the bad guys while the boy hides in a cave sniveling later when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert the gal snaps at him bella and walks quickly ahead leaving him in the dust clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men of course in the real world the result for such manly girls once they become women is that men do not choose them and they remain alone and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men of course in this movie the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy masculine gal but that 's why they call them movies when are these writers artists and other with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females men want someone to complement them not compete with them men crave femininity in females not feminism wow is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie at least his character does progress a little bit by the end of the movie instead of craven and flippant he graduates to something akin to a with a haircut if that is even a step upward but the plucky gal she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of gender relations uh another problem with this movie and there are many is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert something which should be and for a time is here depicted as a foreboding and task yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog and we see the boy 's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally manner considering the dire situation they are in the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these inane scenes look i dig disney kid movies more realistic ones you know old style disney movies you take old yeller '' for example now there was a quality kid movie and quite true to life this movie was not it had a plastic feel throughout disney has gone down the tubes in any number of ways they 've been subverted by radical marxist agendas note one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion something called tapping '' while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their religion this is bias folks leftwing pc bias same as the aforementioned feminist bilge i am learning to run not walk away from disney stuff and this movie was further cause for me to do so ||| 0
having watched great movies in the bible series such as joseph david abraham jacob moses and samson and delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures i was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film what a let down by this anachronism how low can one go ! this is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of god if you do not believe in god have never read the bible particularly genesis but have heard of noah from hearsay perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value a mediocre one at that if you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of noah 's ark do n't aggravate yourself avoid this movie like a plague ||| 0
this movie is not very realistic the sets are great ! but the story is a biblical snafu ! they had the chance to embellish the real story without compromizing the bible 's account but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later which impeached any incredibility it might have had i did n't like it much for that reason ||| 0
the ring two '' is a horror film that gets so bogged down in the minutiae of its storytelling that it simply forgets to be scary naomi watts and david dreckman return as the mother and son who have recently fled to a remote section of oregon in an attempt to escape the murderous clutches of samara the ghost of a young girl whom they encountered in the previous film however like any specter worth her salt samara has managed to track the pair down and quickly begins her scheme of possessing the boy as a way of returning to the land of the living this is an extraordinarily thriller that is little more than a series of extremely mild shocks if you even want to call them that interrupted by long stretches of hopelessly dull exposition the story itself makes very little sense and the climax is so and that i could n't be sure the movie had actually ended until the credits started rolling by the ring two '' has a few impressive special effects up its sleeve but not nearly enough to relieve the tedium that afflicts so much of the movie in a mere two installments this series seems already to have run its course if this ring '' comes answer ||| 0
if you like you might like this attractive leads perform an average script technically good costumes good lighting attractive sets the story holds your attention the detective is interesting and his sleuthing has some interest if you like a light whodunnit you may like this as good as anything on tv today i rated this compared to road to avonlea third season '' mystery episode with christopher reeve which i rate not as clever as the tv show columbo '' but the period setting may make up for this this did not have what i was looking for some adventure more believability more charm and more cleverness the sets are attractively staged '' rather than sets that take you there has pleasant characters but not deep some good humor personality with the servants the appeal is for one who likes a light whodunnit detective film in a period setting without my great expectations i remember young sherlock holmes '' as better though i saw it a long time ago ||| 0

they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden the paid wwe guys just began to the warrior maybe he did have questionable judgment but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved they take some very low blows they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test as soon as he says this they fade to black then come back with a new issue what drug use which drugs presumably they 're talking about steroids but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use let 's not talk about that let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior and they also just try to badmouth him so much who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him hulk and oh yeah they do n't even let the warrior defend himself why did i have to find out from that he was asked to appear but declined why do n't they address this this docu '' is more slanted than fahrenheitt 911 '' every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking ||| 0

michael moore filmed this propaganda partially financed by the united auto workers to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants the japanese auto invasion made possible by gm 's unhealthy cost structure the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal so roger smith becomes the reason for the plant closings years of losses at gm have shown moore 's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then phoney uaw sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the uaw in the death spiral of the automakers moore and others pretend gm management had dropped the ball but gm lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain all of gm 's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the uaw albatross slow redesign cycles lack of money for research you name it moore will never mention how the uaw has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and how now that consumers have a choice they find the better value in asian autos nobody wants to pay a uaw worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor the uaw has fixed labor prices for long enough enough is enough and moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a documentary '' ||| 0

those who describe this story as cute '' and joon as quirky '' are n't paying attention for me this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity the writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness yes depp is great given what he has to work with but overall i am very sorry that i was subjected to this horribly stupid insensitive movie ||| 0
with great music and a setting that reminds you of vampire hunter d '' it sucks you into watching the series the plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing the animation is good which is a must have for me but it was n't enough to redeem the series ||| 0
i only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the twins really bad acting and plot that makes little sense trying to be like the original movie but falls way short its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters not worth it except for the brief shower scene ||| 0

there are two main reasons why this superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects what singer and company have missed is the heart of superman virtues the ideal of the american way noticably absent is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice donner made the mistake in the 70 's of having superman sleep with lois and now singer adds insult to injury by having superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he does n't take responsibility for deadbeat dad using his super powers to invade the privacy of lois in her home drags superman down to the level of creepy peeping tom the second issue concerns personality routh and bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry these are the two ingredients that made reeves and kidder so endearing a new director writers and cast is needed until then at least there 's superman 1 ||| 0
what looks like a good movie to watch quickly turns into disappointment whilst you expect some plot to come together at least on first viewing it is strung together to confuse even to frustrate the viewer i was given no warning about the really really bad quality having a hd large display does not help either the sound is annonying as is irritating in fact i got a refund on the movie hire ! i do n't expect overboard special effect and cgi overlays i expected the quality to be above a cheap cam recorder however the plot is complicated and the noise in the background adds to the disorientation which is done on purpose on the other note the cheap and nasty props do not add anything to crediblility either stay clear but if you have the time and want to view the movie settle back and expect a student '' movie from some high school college this movie although good in concept fails i would like some production house to take it on board create the situation with some convinving special effects to help the storyline better sound widescreen and convincing props it could have been a brilliant movie but is spoiled by bad quality and unconvinving props ||| 0
i was seriously considering purchasing this movie but luckily i saw it at blockbuster one night and decided to rent it before i made up my mind i think it was the smartest move i 've made in my entire life because this movie turned out to be not only the worst lesbian movie but probably one of the worst movies ever made ! the reviews i 've seen for this movie are way too generous i must say believe me when i say that i am not a strict critic i can be easily entertained by the corny ones but this one could not be salvaged and one star is much more than it deserves the fact that is in black and white can be overlooked but the bad acting and scenes reminded me of a film made in middle school unfortunately my girlfriend and i were unable to get through the first 30 mins so i am unable to rate this movie wholly all i can say is please rent it at least ||| 0
i was really looking forward to movie my goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50 's westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing these alone did not turn me off from watching my real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting within the first 10 minutes of the movie a stage coach is robbed my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors they were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers later when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that i laughed as the movie plodded forward scene after scene left me wondering how quickly was this thrown together and how come they did n't rehearse more i felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment i generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly i think it was an embarrassment and waste of time maybe it got better that is why i gave it two stars but i find that doubtful i am wondering if both tom berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of script writing 101 ||| 0
i have seen many pathetic films in my life this topped them did i rate one star i meant negative 11 stars it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping there was no point the script and storyline were pathetic the gore was too much blood killing and the like it was totally historically inaccurate and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his yet he does not even load either time and somehow without even aiming the canon he knocks his 'friend ' off his horse the movie is a failure crappy junky just plain dumb stupid pathetic i am not going to waste any more words on it just you do your money do n't buy it it 's not worth 50 cents ||| 0
you know you 're witnessing the beginning of the end when the best hollywood can come up with is a sequel to a remake not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film but that is exactly what cheaper by the dozen 2 '' turns out to be and the result is pretty much what one would expect this is one of those alleged family comedies in which the adults the male adults at any rate are infinitely more immature in their attitude and behavior than the children they are raising steve martin returns as the prolific father of twelve who is beginning to sense that his children as they are growing older no longer want to spend quality time together as a family to rectify the situation he takes them all on a vacation to a favorite lake resort a move that threatens to turn into a disaster when the bakers find themselves embroiled in a fierce competition with a neighboring family of snooty overachievers led by eugene levy a patriarch who runs his brood with so much regimentation that he makes captain von trapp look like a pushover in comparison one might be tempted to call this a distended version of a brady bunch '' episode and leave it at that but even that show for all its lack of sophistication did n't portray the father as a total and irredeemable doofus with serious developmental issues and the emotional maturity of a bratty besides the stereotype all cheaper by the dozen 2 '' has to offer is lame slapstick a silly romeo and juliet '' subplot and scenes of emotional uplift in which a crescendo of swelling violins serves as the cue for the tears to start flowing the drearily unoriginal screenplay comes replete with the requisite incidents and poop jokes and not one but two scenes of an elderly handicapped gentleman rolling off into the lake in a wheelchair any more of these films and planned parenthood wo n't have to mount a fundraising drive for years to come ||| 0
after reading the novel by jane yolen with my grade classes i was eager to view the film version i had heard conflicting views of the it 's great it 's horrible etc after viewing it for myself i must agree with those who gave it negative reviews however despite its performance the film did serve a purpose in the classroom true the film leaves something to be desired they change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely major events in the rising action are left out thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing overall very few of my students liked the film adaptation of jane yolen 's novel which they found so riveting on a brighter side because of so many differences viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice writing through and venn diagrams it also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills after reading the novel and viewing the film most of my students agreed that the book was much something a reading teacher loves to hear ! ||| 0
this is a '' ronald reagan propaganda style film by that i mean that it tries to portray the us as the good guys being hit by the bad ones it does n't say what dirty role the us cia had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis islam how it set up equipped and nurtured not only bin laden and his but a whole bunch of other loathsome islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe like the islamic brotherhood and the taliban for instance all just to defeat the ussr and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions to fuel the greedy american consumerist lifestyle which us citizens take so much for granted i am not a conspiracy theorist '' these people are usually an absurd breed going off at the other extreme tangent i live in peshawar the hotbed of cia mischief in the and and even now and the area where i live the university town housed all the actors on this stage the us officials and spies their clubs the afghan mujahideen '' leaders ' houses etc etc i grew up seeing all this going on literally next door and so would like to apprise my american friends of the unpleasant truth the national geographic and the reader 's digest magazines are two long established icons of us media culture that have served as the unofficial and therefore hard to suspect mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous us propaganda drives never trust their political commentaries although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very ||| 0
personally i ca n't see this movie for dust in fact i find it extremely annoying the only video worse than this one is monty python and the holy grail '' yecch ! napoleon dynamite no offense to the actor literally puts me to sleep i do n't mind his friend pedro and i also do n't mind his brother the dude with the glasses or his grandmother or even his irksome uncle but napoleon himself is as dull as dishwater if they 'd only take his character out i 'd probably enjoy this movie a little better ||| 0

this movie is just not scary i 'm a huge horror movie fan and this movie has no tension in it no edge of your seat fear i liked the sequel devil 's rejects '' but that is n't much of a horror '' movie either unless you think from dusk til dawn '' is scary corpses '' is about as scary as hostel '' it should never be mentioned in the same breath as texas chainsaw '' because other than trying to look like a gritty 70 's horror flick it has nothing in common with chainsaw '' it has a few moments but they are ruined by scenarios still zombie has potential his follow up reject 's '' was a definite improvement i did n't hate it it 's just not a scary horror movie nothing new no tension but entertaining in some scenes so i 'm giving it 2 stars ||| 0
in essence this is a texas chainsaw remake but here 's the difference and why it 's far inferior i do n't care one iota for the victims '' i can barely tell the females apart the guys are so obnoxious i look forward to them dying unlike texas chainsaw parts one and two horror masterpieces ! this movie shows the psycho family '' hmmm kind of like texas chainsaw far too much a little goes a long way too much overkill ! many plot holes and take away the music there was some really bad acting it gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed but in general rob zombie should not get writing credit for this it 's texas chainsaw massacre only nowhere near as good ||| 0
i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible horrible film mindless banter and weak story line our copy eventually broke stepped on we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star '' seems like a generous rating ||| 0
okay the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen but i like the actors especially ben 's best man so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones or at least why do n't they use them oh no much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor '' charade was so predictable oh gee he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and holmes '' might have to step up and uh they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gon na get busted what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending it was obviously supposed to be a surprise and it was but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience i felt cheated i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah 's little boy and all that i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they 're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen right up to the last moment we think he 's breaking it off with bridget instead what the heck let 's just go ahead and get married after all huh he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane ! ! ! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back this man obviously does n't have a clue what he wants in life and i 'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after not only that but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us do n't do it ! '' and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway it 's just marriage it 's romantic ! you could get lucky and live happily ever after ! it 's been my experience when things are n't feeling just right as you approach that wedding turn and run the last thing you should do is close your eyes grab your balls and take the leap ||| 0
there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to films such as eye for an eye it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end whilst the victim or comes out as the hero at the end it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort but for this critic it is getting old eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film from the opening credits of this film you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end the pauses could be guessed the lines could have been written the night before and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic the violins would always shrill around kiefer and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere this is your typical revenge film with no excitement no frills nothing that would make it stand out from the rest the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end where did eye for an eye go wrong i do n't think i need to count all the ways for you but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic what was sally field 's job i know that is a small detail but it better highlights my complaint that our central family the mccanns were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed ed harris literally walked through his character proving that field 's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion the only character worth watching and was developed briefly was kiefer he was 100 evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end yet we did n't even know that much about him either which upset me schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably did n't even need to read the script and the story played it safe from the beginning but it was n't what i wanted to see i expected film like this to come out during the not in 1996. it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris sally field phillip baker hall keith david and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan nothing stood out in this film nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it and nothing made me feel excited about these actors this was a literal nothing '' film it lent nothing to the cinematic world except and i stress this a bit another peg in a very tired genre known as the revenge thriller '' after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements which made me think of a high school drama production it was amateur at best but she said that is why directors use sally because she is known for being overly dramatic this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly sally saw success with it once but as she continues it only creates bad cinema there were times during sally 's bigger speeches that i found myself laughing i could n't help myself but her focus on certain words and reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he does n't have to play the outlaying father any further in films he was completely wasted in this film was there any emotion with him i did n't see any then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes also did mantegna take a class on how to be a urg his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play police officers again the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself field over dramatized the entire film thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel but alas ole safe schlesinger did n't take us down that darker path i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast yet we chose to stay on the lighted path that coupled with the poor acting just created a film that did n't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world overall in case it was n't obvious this was n't a good movie at all in fact i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the revenge thrill '' fell into that same pattern the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure this film did not sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight while everyone else was forgettable the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil watch this film for kiefer but nothing else skip it ! grade out of ||| 0
this is a surprisingly poor movie although it has some actors and a notable director the material was just presented badly and predictably like a lousy late night with profanity inserted to liven it up the movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings though legitimate in many cases it also glosses over the grieving process of the family ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child overdoes kiefer sutherland 's character flaws which are considerable nevertheless and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title in one scene after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically sally 's character simply stares and dumbfounded at keifer 's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her i do n't know what i missed that the and reviewers like so much i only see mediocrity i would only recommend this for fans of keifer ssssssorry '' sally not your best role or movie ditto ed harris whose other movies i generally like ||| 0

i absolutely abhor this film want to know why because it labled 'valley of the dolls ' and everything jacqueline susann ever wrote into 'great campy fun ' now i do n't know this for certain but i do n't think jacqueline susann wanted people to see her books as cheesy comedies i think she wanted people to take her work seriously and with this awfully made film no one did to others the film might be so bad it 's funny but to devoted fans of the book it 's just depressing the movie was made in 1967 a year after the book was published and you can see that jacqueline susann was ahead of her time because the film is poorly adapted and very censored you know you have a problem when the book would receive an r rating if transferred onto the screen but the movie is only rated pg besides the sex scenes language pill popping and other thematic elements that are left out important details to the plot are also missing anne 's hatred of lawrenceville helen lawson 's screen time jennifer 's complicated and somewhat absuive relationship with tony allen and gino cooper henry 's character development jennifer 's relationship with the senator and the reason she committs suicide the tragic ending etc are all either missing or are shortened down i do n't care if the movie would have been almost three hours long i think if they had stuck close enough to the book then everything would have been fine what a shame and please do n't mention the casting of actors save for patty duke i thought everyone else did a horrible job some of the actors did n't even look the physical part in the book anne is actually a blonde helen lawson has dark hair and jennifer is curvy the thing that really gets me though is why has this film never been remade it 's almost forty years later and i think that this story definately deserves to be given justice and have a proper film adaptation how about kate bosworth as anne welles scarlett johansson as jennifer north keira knightly as neely o'hara joaquin phoenix as lyon burke and liza minnelli as helen lawson well i doubt that will ever happen so in the meantime i recommend reading the book instead and taking it seriously the way jacqueline susann had intended it to be ||| 0

then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else the songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals which arguably were n't that bad what a girl wants '' and get this party started '' were fairly tame to begin with just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds ||| 0
this is an intriguing movie that compels the viewer to search for the film 's deeping meaning i am sure that i missed much of that meaning however one aspect of it is painful clear the crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation i found that premise disturbing and unrealistic also it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex if so this movie could contribute in a small way to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof watch this movie if you must but be critical of its assumptions about relationships ||| 0
simply put the movie is boring upon is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural '' response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death the lawyer has a drunk friend '' and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie save your money save your time choose another movie ||| 0
the premise that one could change specific events in ones ' past through psychic concentration could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller i do n't condemn the film 's corollary either that each change produces new unforseeable tragedies it 's the way the story is told its dialogue and plot its forced obscenity at every turn that reveals its teen sensibilities it is therefore fitting that the director 's preferred ending is included here it is the perfect catharsis for teens who wish i was never born ! ||| 0
you only need to read the book by whitley strieber to know how truly disappointing this movie is ||| 0
since we know there is another version of burn '' out there i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten and get an idea of its can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has told larry king it was his favorite film not if he saw this package ||| 0
read the amazon editorial review they are tiptoeing around saying this movie does n't really work modern language ideas and sensibilities make the whole thing feel like a contrived stage play and it seems to be mostly on stage sets there is n't much of venice in here so do n't rent it for that reason notice i said rent the script is weak the setup for the lead character 's transition to life as a courtesan is abbreviated and unconvincing there are too many horrible moments for this to be romantic the story has so much more potential the only reason to see this movie is to check out catherine mccormack rufus sewell is always good as well otherwise the casting is absurd fred ward and oliver platt stand out as being miscast jacqueline bisset fails to persuade here ||| 0
there is a certain school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound then they are the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable crash '' but at least that was somewhat assuaged by strong performances this arguably the worst mainstream '' motion picture of 2005 is redeemed by nothing an excruciatingly long 2 hours and as much as i usually enjoy george clooney i might never forgive him for this drek ||| 0
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i 'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers ||| 0
this is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills it would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner the shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery the politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray i can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script liberal student who has no clue about the real world 1 and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing bhlswhncatrw 2 interrupts evil corporation '' why are you being redundant the only plus for my wife and i was the acting which was great fiennes was especially good underplaying his character in the early parts of the film resulting in a character with depth and nuance i only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it ||| 0
in the early 1990 's this movie was definitely made for that era just look at the clothing and hair high top fades etc graffiti bridge was definitely unique it should have been released on cable instead of the theater it was more of a musical then a actual movie prince somehow has his own ways of doing things in his own world and he may not care about record sales or what people think of what he puts out but it makes even the most loyal fans question what he is doing the talent he has is amazing but he 's become just a mediocur artist this lack luster film may be remembered a hundred years from now but as of now it 's just what you call a get up and walk out film i 'm a prince fanatic a die hard fan but man the potential this guy has to be a mega star of our time he fails to meet you haft to make people believe in you and really reach them and relate if only prince could relate to what people are feeling now and what they want prince somehow fell behind because the youth of this generation moved on while he stayed stagnet i think he shut the world out and it just went on turning record sales may not matter to him but fans you must keep loyal graffiti bridge is a film in my collection and i just look at it as my collection but nothing more it 's a film that makes you think it 's spiritual and there are some warm moments now purple rain is something not to be missed i recommend that one enjoy ||| 0
oh man this is really ! ! ! i rent this dvd i really really glad i rented it did n't buy this crap ! i thought this series of ghost stories come from would be real shocking and scary gory that 's what u expected from ! ! was looks like our twilligt zone series was made for tv have silly special of slow pasted stories little silly suspense here and lame ! was n't scary at all ! definitely skip this it just wasting time and money i was wondering another review from thom '' did he really saw this movie or someone told him about it gave this movie 5 stars lol ! ! u trippin dude ! ! ||| 0
i purchased this dvd a while ago fyi a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found here years later when i 'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe i guess it 's a little late to complain now ||| 0
i recently purchased this dvd and was beyond disappointed with it i actually ended up fast forwarding just to get through it i expected a true documentary with maybe a few interviews with people who were there with the firemen or anyone at all but the video is mostly silent i can hear the fire fighters radios but most of it is so staticky it 's hard to make out the film has a few comments by the person taping it but that 's it the film also pretty much stays focused on just a couple of areas of rubble i found nothing at all in this film that brought any emotion to me other than boredom i own several other documentaries that i watch over and over as i do n't want to forget the feelings i felt on 911 but this film is lacking greatly in bringing any kind of human element to this horror that was inflicted on our country this dvd was a huge waste of both my time and money ||| 0
like other reviewers i found meetthe parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for 25 bin at hollywood so i figured why not '' well here 's why not it presents the main character 's parents as crude clueless buffoons and having no social judgement whatsoever but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip and for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on fantasy island i 'm surprised they did n't include a sex with a midget scene nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former cia agent who was set up as an object of ridicule oh and they had to be jewish too streisand and hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way our people do n't shoot ducks dear '' do former cia agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built rv that would cost at least 250 k the toilet humor and profanity would n't have made it into dumb and dumber '' nothing reedeming or funny here fuhgeddaboutit ||| 0
i 'll cut to the since plot and story have already been well outlined in previous reviews the basic message of this film seems to be that state controlled education '' is worthy of resurrection and total dictatorship is the way to achieve it though the latter point is probably true the former is questionable indeed why try and save an obviously moribund and mindless system of government indoctrination from its own demise do n't blame the kids you have only to look at the state of the world to see the utter failure that educated people have already created everywhere with world fascism now its ultimate fruitage and the kids at some level know it clearly we urgently need a new vision of education altogether but this film only asks us to glorify what has already died ||| 0
yes this is a supernatural psycological thriller but far from a good one as far as i 'm concerned i love these kinds of stories and i went to see this film with a lot of excitement first because it has a interesting subject second because it has a great actor i thought denzel washington would never associate himself with a bad script but i was wrong but denzel is always top notch the rest is n't by now you already know the story a good detective a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch the hunt blah blah blah the script is idiot from page one the killer as we will see as the story develops travels by simple touch so excuse me why does n't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed i mean the guy is sooo powerful and mobile that i find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place but ok let 's give the screenwriters a break somewhere in the middle of the film the demon enters a cat ok so he can enter all kinds of animals fine later on the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around his brilliant idea the forest full of animals was i the only one who did not know the ending before it came want more in an interesting twist the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on his own brother and no one will believe the truth ! how is he gon na get out of such a mess in the world of storytelling there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation either the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself so he should know ! and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything or something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil despite the fact that there was a way out first line of solution die hard the fugitive second line of solution chinatown we have none of that here instead we have an evil god against a simple man great starter for drama right but the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker and the demon gets stronger and stronger to the point where we get the fact that the demon is invincible long before he actually wins and the great turnaround never comes obviously we all hope he will be defeated and that 's why i kept myself seated all through the film because if there was a way out it would be brilliant if the character dropped the towel it would be thought provoking to say the least but no the ending was easy and predictable the screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions he wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under the story ends bad '' label without any depth every villain has a weak point it is up to the hero to explore it may he loose or win the only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data we have the data the moment the demon enters a cat that 's why we know how 's gon na end what about the girl who helps denzel what about his nephew should n't they be part of the ending too do n't come with the this is an '' kind of talk ! do i sense a smell of desire for a sequel quick ! gas masks ! ! ! ! or as would write quick watson the needle ! '' despite a stupid screenplay denzel is always great ||| 0
sit down under a tree give it a big hug fire up you bong and go to sleep that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this hippie flick i 'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't keep your money say no to drugs ! ||| 0
i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go 's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it ||| 0
i saw this movie for the first time and i found out that it is very very violent and i laughed at some good parts but the scene where amy hits the wildlife keeper on the head with a frying pan for trying to cut the baby geese 's wing is not what you want your kids to see i think that this movie should be taken off the market but this type of film has no place in the lives of young children ||| 0
the dvd is really a deception all the experts invited are the ones that support gnostic theory i was hoping that i can see a balanced view related to this subject instead i only see the point of view of the pro dan brown 's experts i think we should invite the famous evangelists theologists and scholars from the protestant cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue the dvd does not even discuss why the gnostic theory was rejected in the first century ||| 0
sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful ||| 0
period dramas are by definition delicate commodities they 're balanced on that ahem razor 's edge '' between high brow and just plain fussiness i think howard 's end '' is a case of a robust novel buried in tea time and english lace milliners set designers and helena bonham carter 's hair stylist had their job cut out for them on this one ||| 0

i really enjoy both nathan lane matthew brodderick i 'm a marginal fan of will ferrell in this movie i thought he was over the top and it seems nothing in this really gels i knew nathan lane sings really well and was actually pleasantly surprised at matthew brodericks singing voice not pitchy at all good voice but the plot was lame slow the songs did n't flow well and i belived it was too much stage '' and not enough of a movie and i did n't really find it that dark '' even though that 's how this movie was advertised mild satire maybe but nothing near dark it 's more accurately described as bland ! frankly nothing in it worked for me it was a big disappointment if you 're into musicals then you might like it just for the singing that 's the only reason i stuck with it for the first 45 minutes maybe my grandparents would like it i do n't know i 'm somewhat confused by the positive reviews here but i just had to shut it off there was nothing advancing the plot or the characters so i just did n't care how it ended 1 star for the plot 1.5 stars for the screenplay 2 stars for the singing ||| 0
the biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions witch hunter robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime i did n't like it i found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a ' ending i hated the animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky good visuals do n't make up for bad story though this serious drama geared is towards adults and not children if you like dramatic that delivers humor or romantic comedy give this a pass ||| 0
hi folks do n't get your pants in a bunch at the low review its not for the for the appallingly bad dvd grainy and soft i ca n't believe they could n't produce a finer representation of a multi award winning and in general beloved piece of work by all concerned this is n't even vhs quality but then artisan is n't known for quality its cheap enough to get anyway and throw away when a real quality version is released ||| 0
i made the mistake of watching it after seeing how many stars 4 it received from other viewers the plot was butchered the characters twisted the story ruined a pure agony marilla is fat and ugly was n't it supposed to be rachel lynde 's character matthew is sly and conniving and very outspoken what happened to endearing shy matthew rachel lynde had been merged with barry dianna 's mother and hence rachel barry oh brother dianna is a petit blond and not a dimpled raven black haired damsel who gets married behind the scenes without her bosom friend who was sent to queens at 18 as a punishment anne and gilbert are secret lovers brutally separated by marilla who is crossed with gilbert 's father for stealing matthew 's sweetheart many years ago get the picture this movie has no merits as related to the book it might have some as a creation but i have n't found any i wasted nearly an hour and a half of my life and was bitterly disappointed irritated and nauseated the creators of this movie were definitely not kindred spirits ! do yourself a favor if you really like the anne books do n't watch this movie oh and i do wish peter jackson lord of the rings will fall in love with the books and make proper and accurate movies out of them do you hear me peter ||| 0
i 'll be right up front and admit that i do not own this dvd i hesitated writing a review for it because of that fact but then i realized that if you 're reviewing a dvd 90 of the review must be based on the movie itself and having saw the movie when it was released and having seen it again on the various cable channels i felt i could write a respectable reveiw frankly the movie barely approaches a '' status it 's only claim to fame is that it was the first major hollywood motion picture that did not portray homosexuals in a bad light the plot is rather unbelievable naming the fact that all three main characters are leaders in their field successful author network producer doctor nobody has a profession or is in a position with which the audience can relate the dialog is forced and at times rather cliche acting is acceptable though supporting cast members are rather amateurish direction is functional at best one glaring problem is the tendency for the movie to suddenly switch from drama to documentary after or before key scenes the camera cuts to a monologue from one of the main characters the effect is startling does n't advance the story and only serves to distract the viewers and lessen the emotional impact of the film to its credit the actors did portray gay characters and gay love scenes at the time gay characters were never portrayed in a positive light from the media and it was a great risk to do so here there were no previous movie experiences of this topic that the director and actors were able to draw on and they did the best they could it was a very ambitious project and was supposed to be and revolutionary but the weaknesses in the film never raised it high enough to truly make much of a difference in society this is absolutely proven by the fact that brokeback mountain released about two decades later had to work very hard to break the same stereotypes that making love previously attempted to break the difference is that brokeback mountain was a true work of art impeccable in its execution and actually broke ground and stereotypes and making love all but disappeared in the annals of time if you 're a collector of good film this really would n't be part of your collection to add into a collection of films showing early portrayals of homosexuals and homosexual relationships it would be very appropriate sadly it really is good for only that one reason as part of a collection of gay films throughout the years ||| 0
this series might be considered a classic if watched by a but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters most of the plot 's famous unpleasantness '' is just tacked on to the main story and is of no significance apart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses nothing much gets accomplished thought the series the main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series so do n't bother waiting for any meaningful information from her the male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he 's been transported to inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him the most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman who 's included in the story for no reason except to be you can almost hear the writers saying i got it ! let 's rape a little girl that 'll make it real ! yeah yeah i like it ! '' having served her purpose the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series so a little more misery can be dumped on her all the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation the releative standout would be the villian who suffers from bipolarism and alternates between terror anger delight and misery somtimes all within the same scene too bad that was about all he did in the show well that 's about enough if you have an appetite for kid saves alternate universe '' themed anime then you may like this but i found it lifeless and massively overrated ||| 0
alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority the character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by aristotle watching this movie you get the feeling that alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident there is far too much emphasis here on the and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of alexander 's strained relationships with his mother father friends and his own identity if you 're looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient greece look elsewhere this is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant ||| 0
how do you spell 'sucks ' easy ! i loved stone 's jfk but this words fail me but i 'll try to find a few okay the pros angelina jolie i 've never been a big fan of hers but boy was she the hottest woman alive in this movie ! more pros hmmm certainly not the action sequences which were muddled and hard to follow certainly not the weird irish accents the lead characters adopted certainly not the story this is just one of those films you believe can be so bad and that something cool is gon na happen the instant you hit the off button so it stays your finger my advice hit that button ! and i wo n't even mention the blonde wig ! ||| 0
great movie the problem is in the medium of delivery there are 2 dvds in the package each dvd contains approximately of the movie the would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd in addition the dvd is defective the scene where alexander 's father is assasinated consists of some normal footage many lengthy 'still ' pictures no picture at all for a period of time and a short period that looked like satelite feed was breaking all on a dvd that 's supposed to be flawless ||| 0
the first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good in fact it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we do n't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious according to the rumor the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates she was however but we the audience do n't know that however the young woman is quick to think she has been raped why there is no attempt at a physical exam is unexplained especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin however it turns out she is n't so that 's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes fortunately we 're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies either so this does n't turn into a soap opera however we do have the dreamboat hero '' who dreams up the rumor about her being raped and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout but that 's true of the three leads the roommates are all unlikeable being insufferably full of themselves the last half of the film 'dreamboat ' takes the turn as lead character and it 's his story we 're following whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film and basically it 's her introduction to the audience of all the characters turns out 'dreamboat ' and the young woman victim have a history together which means issues they have to work out and everyone else in a way the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth though the characters do n't have the same truth in mind it 's about vengeance not justice and vengeance when it 's not the comic book variety is n't fun for an audience it 's just distasteful in other words the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves and left the rest of us alone so from a brilliant first and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever there is merely too much story so it becomes ridiculous a basically good premise is ruined if you are a fan of any of the stars involved it might be worth viewing if only once but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth perhaps that 's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip or in this case deliberate lies is that what goes around comes around and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach i almost recommend you watch the first min then quit midway but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once just to be sure where this is headed ||| 0

this tepid disappointing sequel is far better than beyond the but dose n't equal a good sequel to the excellent original west and his friend dan dead bodies and when dan 's girlfriend is dying she is just like bride of frankenstein the gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along the new director brian yuzna does a good job taking over stuart gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a channel movie that would debut on tv and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast except jeffrey combs and bruce abbott lower production values and lower budget and tepid to atrocious acting if you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of beyond the ||| 0
there is one thing i finally grasped upon watching 'the 40 year old virgin ' however i came to the realization that hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique 'the 40 year old virgin ' are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas of course they 're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental united states will be for and laugh at anything this film is popular because steve carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he on 'the office ' and people just love those mannerisms ricky gervals is better in the same role by the way but that 's neither here nor there it certainly could n't be because it 's funny the general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise that concept added with the most boiled down middle school potty jokes is not that concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not that concept added with a cross eyed asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up 's of carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not that concept added with 60 year old middle eastern salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not you get the drift maybe the boat left and i was n't on the boat maybe i 'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating chocodiles if you like juvenile humor watch something like 'better off dead ' or 'caddyshack ' watch a movie that does n't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh sincerely bill cosb ||| 0
one of the most overrated comedy shows ever basically the calibre of a high school talent show in a way it reminds me of tom goes to the mayor seemingly fitting into a comedy niche i do n't understand which is more about being weird than being clever but it seems like it 's even more about being dull than being weird i 've heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head i think these guys took that a bit too much to heart maybe the fans see some subtle naunces i 'm missing but to me it seems like i could have written most of this material with little effort ||| 0
this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand portraying the gospel of john beautifully through the movie and slapping and serious scholars in the face with the other hand the scholarly '' comments for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate even the lowliest of bible scholars if honest will realize this it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible while trying to tear it down at the same time the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the dvd i gave the movie to a relative without that add on ||| 0

i was a fan of house the first of the series and so purchased the combo dvd set of house and house 2. i watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while house is pretty good house 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on it is really quite dumb but some of the creatures '' as i like to call him are kind of fun to see i would suggest skipping the second house unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be ||| 0
the beginning is very well done then the only interesting parts are the between jude law and ed harris the rest of the film is bad i 'd say luckily i recorded it from tv it is now erased by the way one of the amazon reviewers who also disliked the film wrote that bob hoskins is american he 's from england ||| 0
this was the most obnoxious time waster i have ever witnessed i kept waiting for the monty python troup to show up the acting was horrid what was with the rocks and urinating on the door i found myself rooting for grendel of the 33 people in the theater 10 got up and left half way through this was a story of great heros not neurotic children too bad gerard butler 's career has come to this i hope the beowulf saga ends here and no attempt is made to do a sequel as discussed in the director interview i would have been ashamed to put my name on this piece of work ||| 0
for a topic this edgy this is an incredibly dull film the actors are good enough mind you but they can only do so much because the real problem with this film is the script for the first twenty minutes or so of screen time the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother you not pick up on that fact at first since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film certainly the two nothing alike finally the main part of the plot begins with natalie just as discontented despite being married to a wealthy and guy alan rickman for whose sake i watched this film at all not worth it and with her brother seemingly happy with his life but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister from that point things spiral no that 's too dynamic a word to describe it out of control with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair the poor brother the only particularly sympathetic character in the film becoming obsessed with the relationship and the worried hubby 's suspicions growing although not in the right direction there 's so much here that have been fascinating and compelling but is n't on any level the plot just wanders aimlessly through an only situation scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet this video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops mercifully for the public but i certainly would n't recommend resorting to buying it ||| 0
i was n't impressed by this film first of all i could never buy '' that saskia reeves and clive owen were a brother and sister nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed relationship they might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems because that 's how the relationship came across personally outside of the topic of incest i found this movie dull and sometimes tawdry clive owen looked and acted like a truculent lawrence harvey and saskia reeves was simply annoying like her character a weak hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man the only actors who showed any real feeling were alan rickman as the husband and karl johnson as clive owen 's boss karl johnson has the best scene in the film he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair obviously suffering from aids and this very fact intimidates the guy he 's gone to meet the man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the karl johnson character and in the end karl johnson seizes the guy 's sandwich and bites it then offers the other guy a bite pushing the sandwich into his face basically it 's a scene that crackles with his anger pain at being trapped by this illness which is going to kill him while this corrupt and man is able to function normally but aside from that call the film dragged and by the time clive owen 's character was shouting in the climatic scene his realization that he 's been used by his sister '' to inflate her sense of i was long gone with my head nodding much ado about nothing frankly one star for the soundtrack one star for the performances of alan rickman what little he has to work with he shines and karl johnson clive owen fans such as myself eeeh pass on this ||| 0
this dvd is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost the film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes the acting is hopeless really really bad ! although there are many soldiers '' involved in the battle scenes it 's all pretty unconvincing considering the carnage of the real conflict in all honesty as much as i enjoy movies of the civil war i 'd like to return this for a refund alas that 's a prospect that has indeed gone with the wind thumbs down to this one ||| 0

you me and dupree is a formula film a template designed for teenage guys who feel the need for potty mouth noisy crude guy things movies there have been a lot of these films of late all spinoffs of the wedding crasher image and one wonders if there is a saturation point relating the story is rather pointless as it is a joke dupree owen wilson playing owen wilson is the best man at his buddy matt dillon 's wedding to kate hudson the you and me and subsequently moves in with them causing all manner of mayhem and bad taste and faux pas and grim situations think toilet problems etc and that is it michael douglas was brought in to play a flat role as kate hudson 's father who objects to her marriage blah blah blah ask directors anthony and joe russo for the rest we know that hudson dillon and douglas have much better roles to offer wilson seems to have found his niche and the only reason films like this keep getting made is because they make money for some reason at the box office the film is silly tacky tired and should only be rented if the shelves in the video store are otherwise empty grady harp november 06 ||| 0
here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i could n't believe what i was watching ! moreover i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating what is going on is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema 's most tedious and overrated sleep inducing actor ralph fiennes how i long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do with the emergence of such a travesty as the constant gardener '' it appears that we unfortunate real '' film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future ||| 0
this movie is a rehash of the first but it is a crappy unconvincing emotionally uninspiring movie let me guess what part 3 will be about a guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time does not alter that timeline the way he wants always worst case scenario and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else ||| 0
after seeing the real show in my girlfriend and i were really looking forward to the dvd and after last night 's viewing i went to bed kinda creeped out and actually felt a little guilty that i did n't like the whole thing that much i 'm relieved to see that other fans just could n't handle all the audience shots either this dvd tries so hard to define paul 's place in our lives and his impact on the world through his music that it ends up blowing it for those of us who already know feel and live it they tried to document his music and its impact instead of just filming it if you 're from mars and this is your first day on earth you might appreciate the way the dvd attempts to explain the relevance of paul 's work if you 've been on this planet for awhile chances are you 're already up to speed and just want to see the band and hear the music ||| 0
this really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out and i accept that but to completely change the ending is not excusable what was wrong with the way the book ended like i said if you havent read the book you will like this movie although they do solve these very complex puzzles after a glance at them even though they hide a very very valuable secret that will change the world if you havent read the book or seen the movie do yourself a favor and pick up a copy its a better story and its cheaper if bought in the paperback if you dont have time to read it then get it on audio disk or tape ||| 0

the details are all fine if you do n't know the middle east but are not well researched and inconsistent i wo n't bore you with the list all the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake tell us something new the overall storyline does not have much else going for it i was expecting more intrigue a more synthesized story line a disappointment ||| 0
if you have read and enjoyed any of the save your buy the graphic novel of the original dark phoenix saga and pretend this movie was n't made if you want to see some special effects are n't that hung up on character development i 'd still just rent it ||| 0
saw this movie at the actual premier in nyc and met sturla gunnerson and i told him exactly how i felt gerard butler needed a bigger horse i expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater sarah polleys language was uncalled for in the film they could have written better lines the fade in fade out was like a child filming with a video camera the film was funny at times and mixed with gore like eating sweet and sour being a gerard butler fan i was distressed after watching this film why did he do this gerry butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes this unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like the jury please or the phantom of the opera i expect butler to be past these b films and know he does have much better stuff in the works than goodness all in all the film was terrible the scenery was captivating and breathless i at times found myself saying wow but it was about the story of beowulf grendel and it did not meet my expectations that i have read even in the easiest translations all i can say is butler your an incredible talent becareful what you choose movies like this can paved the way to a downward spiral i know butler is indeed better than this ||| 0
the basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting how does a man trained as a ' integrate back into society yes it 's been done before but still holds promise the plot was adequate the acting was believable no complaints there i particularly enjoyed sean pertwee as 'mace ' and jason isaacs has long been a favorite actor but what ruined the movie for me was the science i 'm not a fanatic i have no problems with ftl travel or spaceships 'banking ' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies and i realize that movies are not 'real ' but i 've never seen more 'bad ' science in any one movie my son and i watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers i could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie but it would take me all night it spoiled the whole movie for me ||| 0

growing up i absolutely loved the turtles but this dvd stinks the only plus is that i can have the original episodes in convenient dvd form rather than track down a bunch of old vhs tapes this dvd is no different from the season one and season three dvd 's they all have spelling errors and title errors and each one seems to have been produce in a fashion just to capitalize on the new turtle 's sucess which by the way the new turtles are much better than the old ones on the season three dvd the package refers to bebop '' as bebob nice editing job i guess it was to hard to get that one right also all three of the dvd 's are bare bones with no special features the price does however reflect the crappy job the studio did on this most of these dvd 's can be purchased for around 10 bucks i just wish that peter laird had the rights to the old show so that it could have been done some justice on dvd ||| 0
unfortunatly this dvd set is defective on disc 1 episode 3 the picture just freezes and then loops back to the opening scene i sent one back to amazon then got a replacement and had to send that one back as well so i thought maybe the ones at the store might not be defective so i bought a copy at target and it 's the same problem ! i 've written to anchor bay twice and they have n't bothered to reply this situation really angers me because i love this season but am not going to waste money on a defective product do n't buy this dvd until the problem is resolved ! ! ! ! ||| 0
i got this movie on sale a couple years ago it looked pretty good but you know how most of that goes i really lke movies like scream i thought it would be like that but nope this movie was a hundred percent perdictable i knew everything that was gon na happen in this movie from the first seen you can tell it 's gon na suck the first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out the lights flicker wow how original and a person in a really really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax this is what happens throughout the entire movie do n't waste your time or money if you really want to see it i would suggest renting it not worth more than 3.00 anytime ||| 0
i guess i expected more out of this movie but i confess i was mildly disappointed in it at first the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling still it was a great cast dean martin was particularly adept at westerns much more so than frank sinatra who pretty much plays frank sinatra in this one it is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies in this case anita ekberg and ursula andress the bad guys are well represented by victor buono and charles bronson a fun movie but not particularly memorable ||| 0
beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that was real disappointed by gate this film is tepid there is none of the satanic that you find in 'rosemary 's baby ' it 's too hollywood surprisingly considering the maverick presence of film opens well with a suicide and depp 's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere exorcist 3 which i was equally disappointed in at least was more satanic i wo n't spoil anything for those who do want to see it but the showdown scene between depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed emmanuelle seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a demona and the 'showdown with the devil ' is a letdown to say the least this film could have been great but polanski dropped the ball considering he was the and the film fails in all three areas it 's not horrible so i give it 2 stars but do n't buy this film rent it only buy angel heart instead ||| 0

i recently discovered this set available on dvd and was very excited since i 've been a fan of david suchet agatha christie and hercule poirot for a long time i was really looking forward to viewing these however the poor quality of the image was apparent to me in the first scene and it did n't get better the image quality is actually worse than what i 've seen on aired on television via cable the picture appears to be composed of thousands of tiny vertical lines which are easily discernable and difficult to ignore i 'm amazed acorn would release such a great series in such a low quality package and then charge so much for it i will definitely not buy any other titles by acorn media ||| 0
the first set was very entertaining a caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by moore and curtis set ii is another kettle of fish altogether the second set is strictly played for laughs there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin frankly i hoped for more for those who wish to obtain a true collector 's set of this highly entertaining series would do better to purchase the network dvd megaset special edition of the persuaders now available thru amazonuk with some delighful extras including bumpers promotional materials episode commentaries tv spot interviews title sequences and interviews with director robert baker tony curtis and roger moore tony curtis ' unabashed comments regarding the production team joan collins 's antics on the set and his marijuana bust en route to london for the taping of the first episode are absolutely priceless in this network dvd set surprisingly the acute observer will notice that some of the episodes in the second box of the a e set are written by none other than terry nation who would go on to pen a bigger and more serious series survivors in the uk four years will that be available in the us ||| 0
this is a documentary about half japanese most of the critics ca n't remember a dambed thing except for how great they are for recognizing the greatness of jad while continuously ranting about their major label conspiracy theories penn jillette even goes so far as to brag about how he conned a homless person out of jad 's material and then threatened jad with physical violence if he ever talked to the guy if you 're interested in mental illness and sleazy people like penn jillette stroking themselves then by all means watch this if you 're interested in a great american rock band then just buy the albums and listen ||| 0

let me start by saying if you are considering purchase of this film make your own decision as to if you will purchase it this is simply my opinion of the film this movie has horrible fight scenes that do n't appear to be martial arts at all basically van damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities and forces him into a stiff choreographed position they found some buff guys okay big deal they put them in a film and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills these guys do n't have that vin diesel has far better choreography by himself i have said this about other films and i will say it about this one as well the cast crew benefited from the production of this film so it doesnt affect them they go home happy believing they did a good job you the consumer you go and see it on the shelf and recognize a star on the cover and consider buying it wrong move as for this film you will waste money that could have been put into your retirement or used to buy your children school paper as they educate themselves save that money and put it where it belongs this is not worth your cash ||| 0

okay this movie is a complete waste of time for even the most diehard college basketball fans nick nolte does a fine job acting like bob knight coaching ucla or in this case the fictional western univ that is until the 'real ' bob knight coaches indiana against nolte 's fictional team in the climactic game at the end i was a student at iu when nolte was going to every indiana home game in order to study how a real college basketball coach acts at the time indiana was number 1 in the nation so nolte got a lot of attention for his role however the acting by shaq hardaway and matt nover was absolutely horrid ! the plot centers around a legendary court nolte as a knight right down to the sweater who is turned to cheating by those nasty alumni and boosters he takes his dirty team through the season and plays number 1 indiana at the end the real bob knight shows up with a cast of former iu legends and one duke legend in bobby hurley anyway after beating the squeaky clean indiana team nolte rats out the alums and boosters for their recruiting violations other than nolte nobody gives a really solid performance mary mcdonnell is good but she 's hardly in the movie bob cousy plays the ad and he does an okay job for a guy who is n't even an actor hardaway is terrible and matt nover is just plain horrible the only part really worth watching is the final game between indiana and shaq 's team it does a good job of taking you inside the huddle as you actually see and hear knight diagram plays and nolte does the same however it just turns into a highlight reel of shaq dunking if you want to see a good movie just watch hoosiers again also i 'd like to be on whatever mind altering drugs the people who gave this movie 5 stars were taking ||| 0
this is not a collection of the superbowls played from start to finish as some of the reviewers would lead you to believe i got this for my father so he could watch the tromp all over the broncos over and over again since they certainly have n't been up to much lately ! unfortunately all we got was a collection of highlights with so many up close and personal '' shots that it was almost nauseating to watch on a bigger screen tv an expensive disappointment surely ||| 0

wuthering heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion betrayal madness despair greed hatred and revenge it 's not necessarily a pleasant read but always an engrossing one emily bronte 's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you 've finished the book modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the bronte sisters ' works into film and this is no exception the characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book juliet binoche and ralph fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today but this movie is a definite low point for both as heathcliff and catherine fiennes and binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland binoche 's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role the other characters are likewise lacking in realism only janet mcteer fares well she is fabulous as ellen dean even if the acting were better the story does not capture the essence of the book everything moves too quickly the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words sinead o'conner 's appearance as emily bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary this film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it the wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part ugly and unflattering fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests ! maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice this is n't it ||| 0

i 'm not sure what everyone else watched maybe i was expecting to much after reading these other reviews but i was more than just a little disappointed the women are attractive that is for sure but that 's the only thing this movie has going for it the sex footage was over before is started at the most they lasted about 30 seconds i 'm not looking for porn but this was far from what i was looking for my suggestion is ||| 0
20 years ago there was a terrible accident in the mine on valentine 's day the following year one of the miners harry warden takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident since that day there is no celebration of valentine 's day in the little town valentine 's buff until now that is 1981 but harry warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration the music as music is quite good but it does n't lead the film in any direction so it 's not helping the story is recycled which is good but could have been much more minimalistic why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids and trying to put a twist to the story by explaining '' things is seldom very helpful the murderar places human hearts in valentine boxes which is distasteful but not really scary a variation on the holiday theme that could have been a bit more focused ||| 0
are you kidding me ! this movie is beyond all redemption sean conery is a disgrace to himself running around in a red diaper with pirate boots on wtf ! what 's with all the naked women in this thing why do they have to be naked they 're hideous looking in the face and body my god my eyes ! if this is the product of the love '' generation and what they found to be entertaining and mindfully stimulating no wonder our society is crazy i just ca n't get over how profoundly corny and simple the plot and effects are it 's downright insulting to the human brain whoever wrote this and was crazy enough to finance it should be killed and then studied so we do n't have another idiot of this caliber spawned ||| 0
this is the worst version of 'wuthering heights ' i have ever seen please if you are a fan of emily bronte 's classic do n't waste your time on this movie i do n't know how anyone could try out for a part in a movie without reading the book it was based off of first none of the actors read the novel instead try seeing the 1939 or 1992 version they are worth your time and money ||| 0
i first saw the movie poster and was n't particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler but then i heard composer alan menken who had worked on beauty the beast and aladdin was attached and this made me rethink my position then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before still i went into the movie theater ready to give home on the range '' a chance and fell asleep i found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak i admit the animation is fine but not spectacular and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between apparently home on the range '' was meant to be released before brother bear '' but because of story issues it was delayed i do n't think it should have been made in the first place it has also ruined the work laid out by brother bear '' for a new disney renaissance i think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired because not only is it terrible but it ended mainstream animation for disney a massive loss to the entertainment industry the dvd has an audio commentary with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster there is also a behind the scenes featurette games art review and music more than this movie that never should have happened deserves ||| 0
i 'm a fan of audrey hepburn and this movie relys heavily too heavily on her charm and unfortunately it is some of her worst acting work posey and superficial now if you 've read her bio and know what was going on with her and holden that could explain it but still this film is very static like most heburn films a highlight is her clothes her style her self this film relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better there are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here this film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead jayne mansfield could have been a hoot in this thelma ritter too in a very different way somebody with less style and more off beat snap crackle and pop thelma ritter and william holden paired in a romantic comedy i 'm all ready laughing ! before i hit this too harshly this film was intended to be a trifle the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles for that it is adequate the remake alex and emma suffers very much from the same problems they actually improved the script and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices but both films seem to have suffered from settling for a star '' when a less mainstream more zany actress was needed ok this does n't stink it has audrey but it certainly does n't sizzle ||| 0

i have four kids boys and girls ages 3 to 8. we all love hot wheels world race we previewed the first acceleracer movie and were very disappointed ! i agree that perhaps it is targeted to some older kids but that leaves a void for the younger ones why do the characters have huge unnatural feet and arms not to mention lani 's breast augmentation lani now looks like a streetwalker taro my favorite like a cheap hood and what happened to marky the themes have turned dark the behavior street racing violence nastiness provides an incredibly poor example a movie that was very safe and innocuous has turned into a minefield for my children i disagree with some reviewers that the kids do n't pay attention '' to those parts we will not let our kids watch this trash ! my kids and their parents are mystified at why such a good thing was allowed to go so far down we told them it is rated pg i agree with that reviewer and they might watch it when they are older parents beware do not trust materials marked for children to necessarily be appropriate ||| 0

i am a bbc devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic bbc storytelling and visual feasting however i was only partially correct it is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly i left the film feeling robbed disappointed sad and a bit unfulfilled i viewed it only once and then sold it on at a price do yourself a favor and save your time and money ||| 0

while i have not purchased this box set i have seen many of the episiodes several times as i am a fan of spongebob allthough he and patrick can be a bit pathetic at times for example in the idiot box '' when they order a tv just to play in the box anywhyey as someone has said in there reviews some dummy snipped out just one '' bit of the episiode just one bite '' which is my personal favorite spongebob episiode because of the music as well as the humor you all know it so there 's no need for explanation i think it 's so pathetic that certain scene 's in cartoons have to be snipped out ||| 0

i bought this movie without seeing it first and have now watch it at least two times through some chapters i watch several more times this movie has three things against it first i was very disappointed with the number of product placements in this movie it takes alot away from the whole movie second it has too much of the same stuff that can be seen in any recently released wm movie same people doing the same exact things third the sound track was way below par i 'm still a warren miller fan and the movie does have some good ski footage but i do n't think the wm bunch went out of their way to make this a good ski movie ||| 0
do n't bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like i did the earlier artisan release is still much better than this special edition the image is better and also the sound i do n't know what lions gate thought they were doing but remastered no i compared both several times before writing this even though i only had to compare once might as well wait for a hd dvd to come out this is a waste unless you want the additional features ||| 0
an average customer review of almost 4 stars have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia jason supposedly went to hell yeah then why is still in one piece this time round the government realise there 's nothing they can do to stop jason and have him captured he is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm unfortunatley he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space ! yes space ! the budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good there may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it 's just not enough ! this sequel sounds more like a star trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good friday the flick supposedly a twelfth friday the movie is being made if you count the excellent freddy vs jason while freddy vs jason was indeed impressive there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore ||| 0

the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love ||| 0

let me break it down for you in a nutshell people it 's a murder mystery in which the film 's protaganist thinks she knows who the killer is but she has her doubts but she saw a tatto of a spade on the guy 's arm he has the same thing but what does she do she has sex with him sex sex and more sex if you suspect somebody of being a killer than why on earth would you have sex with him plus 50 of the movie is just plain old sex and sex talk i do n't think this was a perfectly planned movie to tell you the truth final verdict it 's easily forgetable and needs to go right before it starts ||| 0
alright take a step back and tell me there is n't something decidedly wrong even militantly spooky about the american southwest you know what i 'm talking about no let me clarify then we 're driving me thee across some barren stretch of ancient arizona moonscape and we 've hit upon what i call the magic hour when the day is laying down its sword in honor of old man night and the setting sun is really firing up all those sleeping reds and oranges and deep feral yellows up on the rocks the hills the cliffs the crags the bluffs can you see it can you hear the coyotes keening and wailing and away back up in some box canyon where those stunty trees wave their straggly evil twisted arms towards an absentee heaven we still think of america as a young country and maybe that 's just our innocence talking because this land is just as ancient as any trod by the african or chinese and ca n't you just smell the terrible old buried down under the earth when you 're out on the high desert sure as the town of desperation 's former sheriff former in that he 's going through something of a midlife crisis would say gosh yes the guts and sheer pulpy bloody visceral glory of stephen king 's novel desperation '' rides that seam of ancient buried hulking horror like a housewife saddling up the mechanical bull at gilley 's and that 's half its charm is why i was expecting so much with mick garris 's cinematic version and no doubt why i was just so damned disappointed the setup the build the execution about desperation '' cuts thematically close to the territory king marked with his tale cujo '' remember cujo '' something ancient and unspeakably evil and deeply stupid and hungry nasty lies all in a dark cujo bumbling naive benevolent lumbering into its domain and gets eaten devoured turned into a shambling rabid hulk of its former lovable slobbery self transformed into a ravenous engine of death with one single design to spread carnage red and raw and toothy across the trembling land now just as the arc and trajectory of the bullet is n't all that mindful of its casing so too the unsleeping ancient evils of cujo and desperation are n't too picky about their corporeal hosts whether it 's a dog or a lawman the only real concern is where to pile the bodies or so you 'd think sadly desperation '' is a tiny little bang and a ton of whimper 15 minutes of shivery brilliance and what feels like about 8 hours of unbridled dullness that bristling tale of ancient sleeping hungry evil ripped out of his slumber with the explosion of the charges in the rattlesnake pit and his unquenchable desire to eat his way out into the guts of the little town of desperation of the novel 's frantic hardscrabble fight against a mounting relentless evil is wasted by mick garris 's listless uninspired direction it 's as if garris burned up his budget hiring ron perlman to run the numbers as collie entragian and then outsourced the rest of the flick to bangalore hell they even dragoon some mountain lion to take a chunk out of flabby old charles durning 's patooshka and even that does n't jack up the on this miserable thing not that i 'm complaining about perlman this sad little flick bumps and grinds and gets its crawling kingsnake when entragian is on the screen and perlman is the perfect choice as the lawman who goes all economy on us and squeezes both good cop bad cop into one body then goes on to downsize his jurisdiction with extreme prejudice tak ! desperation '' has its 15 minutes of brilliance with that fatal traffic stop everything is just about note perfect those lying impossibly high western skies the trooper lurching out of his cruiser that gary cooper drawl just crackling out over the silence of the high desert the spike of dread at the curt command to step out of the car succeeded by a queasy flood of relief when god ! 's just a it 's here in the seconds before desperation '' lurches forward into horror that the movie succeeds that it creeps and crawls the way the book did it is here that the film conjures up the loneliness of the vast stretches the realization most american suburbanites go to their graves without knowing there are wild spaces on this crazy planet where you could be murdered and buried without anyone knowing how or why while the coyotes howl the scorpions scuttle and clatter the black widows stalk and spin and move itchingly towards their prey gosh yes js ||| 0
so i thought i only saw pieces of the abc presentation of desperation on tv i thought i missed the chapter about the first family david 's family and how they came to be in the town jail it turns out i did n't miss anything that 's the way it was filmed when i heard the film was available on dvd and r '' rated too i vowed to rent it and see the movie as it was designed to be seen curses gore adult scares and perhaps a booby ! one would n't expect anything but the most watered down presentation on abc but the r '' rated version oh boy ! the dvd rated r '' was exactly the same presentation word for word and scene for scene with the only difference being the exclusion of commercials i 'm going to say and prove me wrong that the r '' rating was slapped on the dvd to intice people to rent it to see the original adult version what a sneaky how can they do that overall the movie was not great the ending was completely tacked on and i got a little tired of the sermonizing the performances were ok with the exception of ron perlman 's performance he was outstanding i know amazon sells this dvd but they also sell the book and the book is much more satisfying it 's hard to believe the same guy that wrote the movie also wrote the book i 'm sure everybody made lots of money on this project but i 'd like my money back ||| 0
this review might contain some spoilers was disappointed with this anime after all the reviews i read i was expecting alot more it was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over there was some humor but all in all i would not waste money on it infact i took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after i purchased it ||| 0

we bought several different potty training videos and this was unexpectedly the worst the reason it lacks focus it comes off as more of a production made by people who never had kids or at least do n't remember what potty training is all about it goes back and forth between elmo and short film and animated clips that focus on independence and doing things for yourself but it does n't really hold a 2 year old 's interest and the song lyrics and such are overly complicated for a child of that age my older daughter who 's potty trained for years now watched it more than my son who grew bored really fast if you are going for entertainment get this dvd but if you want your little one to start giving up diapers go with potty power ||| 0
this experience was totally unsatisfactory ! ! ! i received a notice that the product had been shipped it included a very long number to trace the shipment it was promised for february but did not arrive on february you wrote me that the shipment was never made now which is it did you have it and misplace it in the process or did you lie when you said it was already send out i have had otherwise good results in my purchases from amazon but this is a real i wrote to ask how to reorder and this is the only response since then is there anything you can do to change this do you reprint reviews of your service ||| 0
sorry but this movie certainly showed a horrific side of the old west sure there were some noble men and victimized young chinese girls but they were way outnumbered by the rotten men and women depicted in the movie i do not find very graphic violence nudity and rape on the top of my must watch list i skipped to the ending on the second disk ||| 0

peter sellers as well as peter o'toole and all the beautiful women capucine romy schneider etc make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60 's was really that world that mad of course ! you could n't stand life without a psychonalist thus the film reflects precisey that the lack of the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade till ending of o'toole and schneider get married and lived happily everafter and everybody has surpassed their personal crises good for the movie the humour is just wonderful i recommend it most enthusiasticall ||| 0
the year 1965. the cast peter sellers peter o'toole woody allen ursula andress the soundtrack burt bacharach tom jones dionne warwick manfred mann the movie believe it or not terrible really as in unwatchable other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits painfully unfunny slapstick routines actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards and no plot to speak of not even fun to watch for 60 's camp value like the party or casino royale i had to turn it off at about the halfway mark grade incomplete safest bet get the soundtrack skip the movie ||| 0
i am a big fan of woody allen and i presume that i will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies prior to viewing what 's new pussycat i would have presumed that i would enjoy each and every movie however what 's new pussycat '' has shown me that even woody allen can make a disaster movie what is wrong with this movie is just about everything the acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up we start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees peter o'toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women he proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous he calls all his femine friends pussycat '' which gets old after a while he constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather approach toward his playmates he seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by peter sellers sellers does his best with what little he has to work with he has the strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times woody allen wrote the script which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture i once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3. with woody allen the comedian said you can use all 10. in what 's new pussycat i wish there had been at least three good jokes this overlong look into the problems that o'toole 's character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of bennie slapstick i take that back there 's no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of bennie hill by associating it with this turkey anyway the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of o'toole 's mistresses an incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring track presumeably all fashional french chateaus have a conveniently adjacent track this enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind after all we have some top talent in allen sellers and o'toole and we see them spontaneously go off into the sunset or the side of a building or a mud puddle or something meant to be funny i was glad to be done with the movie woody allen is a great talent peter sellers was a great talent peter o'toole was a great talent watch them in their other productions but spare yourself the one movie that each one of them should not have made ||| 0

do n't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series it is a six hour bore an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other there is no heat in this story no real passion no real romance it is a dry boring drawn out and uninspired as they come the writing is atrocious and while the actors should be given credit for not choking on the swill they have for dialogue they are completely unbelievable the story is utterly predictable though it goes off on pointless tangents and ignores potentially interesting subplots and the only thing surprising is that anybody ever thought it would be a good idea to make this drivel it does n't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency with terrible editing pathetic sound and blatant continuity problems take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile the bbc has made many better mini series and pretty much any one of them would be preferable ||| 0
next to a night at the roxbury another will ferrell zero this is the worst movie i 've ever seen so maudlin and it dragged on and on and on it could actually make the viewer pray for death to end the torture so i guess it has some authenticity brad pitt 's particularly bad one facial expression blank and a painful monotone delivery i think he got some award aptly represented by a carved wooden statue of keanu reeves brangelina jolie looks awful next to a brilliant thespian like anthony hopkins bottom line this movie stinks and so ironically does pitt ||| 0
metropolis '' fritz lang 's 1927 silent masterpiece is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one ! but over the years this film has been reedited recut and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary its stay on the public domain shelf the prints and image quality have over the years been do not recommend the following goodtimes video release has poor image quality and even worse no musical score ! madacy dvd which is about 5 times as worse as the goodtimes video release contains horrible blurry image quality opening titles and an annoying musical score ! just recently tcm turner classic movies has broadcast the beautifully restored 2002 restoration of metropolis '' which i taped off of and trust me it 's well worth it ! buy the kino restored version on either vhs or dvd but do not buy the horrible public domain versions which can definitely rip you off ! a terrific film and thanks to kino for making this restored version a definite ! i also recommend the 1984 rerelease by giorgio moroder which is now unfortunately and buy the soundtrack to go with it ||| 0
can someone please tell me where to get the dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles the recent hong kong legends release is crazy chinese audio or english audio but no english subtitles ! i have the original chinese subtitled the subtitles are imbedded version of this movie on a universe vcd and based on the merits of its available chinese subtitles alone it is a better movie by magnitudes than the one s commercially available to the hapless market the english dubbing on this dvd even though well synchronized with the actors ' lips takes so much away from the film nevertheless especially its '' which is a major reason i enjoy this movie genre take for example the scene where our hero first returns to jing woo school after learning of his master 's death and sees first senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master after handily defeating the challenger first senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the english soundtrack completely and deplorably misses also at the very end of the release film chen says he is going back to his japanese girlfriend in the original hong kong release he actually goes off to fight the japanese with the resistance movement between these two examples there are many such gross audio enough at least to take three stars away from an otherwise martial arts film the best of jet li 's filmography and perhaps the best of the modern '' martial arts genre period the same criticism holds true for jet li 's the tai chi master released in the as the twin warriors it 's an english soundtrack superimposed over a chinese movie often stripping the film of its unique cultural forcing the film through an american '' template and reducing the potential for mental as opposed to strictly visceral enjoyment to a pitiful minimum we end up with a film typically devoid of humor character development and silver screen intimacy '' a film precariously out of balance with and far flung from its careful directorial intent if you value the full content visible and audible of chinese martial arts films but lack facility in the host language then the next best thing is a original language version and this release clearly is not that by a long long long shot ||| 0
if you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good not great acting jessica lange basically does an impression of marilyn monroe with a southern accent well not all of the time since her accent seems to come and go the amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has skip it unless you really really really love jessica lange by the way if this movie is set in the early sixties why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall this is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend ! ||| 0

of course the criterion collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer the problem is the film itself preston sturges made some genuinely profound films such as the lady eve unfaithfully yours and hail the conquering hero that are rich and complex experiences but sullivan 's travels is simplistic pretentious and false as the film 's characters themselves point out poverty is only intersting to the rich whose view of it is distorted character actors in dingy sets make a rich man 's view of poverty and not at all related to the real thing sturges was one of the most men in america so his view of the subject matter is like characters say in the film based on cliche the climax with its laughing at a cartoon is pretty dopey and a fairly unconvincing argument for comedy sturges would do better to point to how comedy in his best films allows him to examine angry love role playing and a host of other themes in other words how humor gets into the darkest and most ambigous areas of human life that serious '' drama can not so easily reach this film is exactly the kind of film that sullivan wants to make which is why it is so overearnest and uninteresting if you want to see the genious of preston sturges watch any of his other films even harold diddlebock in their entirety after the first 10 minutes a simplemindedness takes over sullivan 's travels that make makes it a dispiriting film ||| 0
i love stargate and give the movie 5 stars i own a vhs copy and have watched it many times with that said this ultimate edition '' is not ultimate at all there are no real special features the documentary is a cheesy one that explores if there is a real stargate but there are no no behind the of star gate insights at all this documentary has nothing to do with the of the movie this does not by any means make this dvd ultimate this dvd edition is n't ultimate at all but extremely mediocre the only special feature on this disk is a audio commentary that can run during the movie that 's it really no kidding ||| 0

what a disappointing purchase this was ! i have never purchased a dvd set that was this bad in quality without it being pirated actually i 've seen vhs copies with better quality if i had not purchased the set from amazon itself i would have thought i did get a cheap bootleg the sound is a bit flat which i could deal get over but the picture quality is just horrendous ! all of the episodes are grainy pixilated and some even blur a bit there are whole episodes where the show is so dark you can hardly tell what is going on it 's a waste of money to buy dvd 's like this shame on fox for releasing them this bad ! as for the show itself well it would be kind to say it was okay in truth it is not that great i wonder how the show made it to season two at all the acting was bad the dialog was atrocious the stories were subpar i could go on but i think you get the idea usually a shows first season is the best or at the least good enough to make you want to see the next run but not this one in short do not buy this set even if you are a fan you can tape reruns on the fx channel in better quality ! ||| 0

the simple truth is this movie is boring yes it has a really long not to say interminable rape scene in it and yes some guy gets his head smashed in with a fire extinguisher but so what it 's still boring we just sort of drift around from moment to moment through what seem to be virtually unscripted scenes backwards through the story '' which has pretty much no focus or ultimate impact then it 's over and you get to do something more interesting like shine the silverware do n't get me wrong i like dark and disturbing films texas chainsaw massacre anyone but i prefer them to at least be interesting and involving i 'd take anything david cronenberg ever made over this and i 'm including the early stuff ||| 0
warning spoilers opening scene is quite shocking some graphic effects there is more male nudity and male genitalia than female there is only one quick very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning or end '' of the movie since the movie begins with the ending scene '' and ends with the opening scene '' the rape scene is violent with graphic language obviously actual penetration is achieved anal but none shown not even a good boob shot you of course '' see the male genitalia big deal ! movie is revenge driven and that seems to be about it does n't have a great script may be good to the french but not to us standards movie is in french with english subtitles ||| 0

peter segal 's anger management '' is a film with nothing going for it it is best described as boring annoying and devoid of laughs dave buznik adam sandler is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding he immediately develops a problematic relationship with buddy rydell jack nicholson the expert leading the sessions as the two men spend more and more time together buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling anger management '' just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like it is essentially a film that wears out its welcome very quickly sandler and nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker furthermore the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings truth be told anger management '' is one of those projects that was because of the talent involved and not because of its quality ||| 0

robert groden suggests that the zapruder film of the kennedy assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of kennedy in my opinion his evidence '' is shaky at best groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who really '' shot kennedy and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by abc cbs and many books groden needs to finally realize that the kennedy assassination has been solved definitively and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money alive do n't draw a conclusion based on this dvd ! look at other sources listed below and then draw your conclusion 1. abc 's peter jennings presentation of the kennedy assassination available on clearly shows that oswald was the one and only killer of jfk 2. cbs 's dan rather 's special program on the kennedy assassination available on cbs website also suggests that the preponderence of the evidence points to oswald as the lone killer 3. the book case closed '' by gerald posner he uses the physical evidence collected in dallas logic and his ability to see through the fallicies of the conspiracies to show that lee oswald is the lone assassin 4. the book marina and lee '' by priscilla johnson mcmillian this book shows that oswald was certainly capable of the assassination and the circumstances of his life point to the conclusion that he killed kennedy my advice is to watch this dvd first and then look at the sources i list above and then make an intelligent conclusion if you are like me you will see that groden really has nothing solid to stand on jim konedog '' konedog kennedy assassination stuudent ||| 0

please do not waste your time or money on this piece of trash not only is harvey walden unconvincing in his role as drill sargeant he lacks passion as is evident by the body language and expressions of the exercisers in the video unlike other excercise gurus he does not exercise with you instead he stands on the sidelines and barks out commands the production quality is very low budget it looks like it was shot using a camcorder the set is bland and melancholy and there is no music ! all you hear is the loud marching of the feet of the exercisers who display no enthusiasm at all and i for one ca n't blame them i only hope they got paid for what must have been an extremely painful project for them i was never more bored in my life walden 's cuing is off and furthermore it is difficult to follow an excercise instructor who does not do the moves with you that 's just crazy what was he thinking i have no words to describe how awful this video is i wish i could give it 0 stars do n't waste your money please ! ! ! ! the other reviewers must be new to exercise because i ca n't understand how they could n't see that this video lacks what an experienced exerciser would expect if you want a energizing effective calorie burning workout you will not like this video at all you will be sorely disappointed for sure instead try kathy smith 's peak fat burning or any one of her step workouts ||| 0
the only thing worse than seeing this movie is the fact that it plays automatically all over again when it 's over this is a glorified music video of horrible music jim carey should not be on the cover of this movie either as he is in about 15 to 20 of the whole thing they should have had whoever the musical artist was i honestly do n't even know the plot of this movie and i 'm not kidding i laughed so hard out loud when i had to read the back of the dvd case to remember what it was supposed to be about the sound they interlaced two songs one in your right speaker one in your left that do n't even match if you want an idea for a good movie read the back of this dvd case and follow that plot as the director sure steered clear of it alan thicke i thought i knew ye ! oh and i gave it one star only because i could n't find the give me my money back '' option it 's currently selling at in the used section that says something right there it 's almost tempting to buy to give to people i go to a university out in okc and we 've passed it around the dorm telling everyone it 's the best movie ever ! it 's so funny !

poor lindsay lohan it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off as an actress she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft as a child actress she was a natural fit for her spate of disney appearances with freaky friday her crowning achievment however as a young adult the pressure is much higher as is the bar of success and movies like this are not helping but to be fair one can not place the blame on lohan the fact is she has already had a turn in a role which paid off exquisitely mean girls offered us the first glimpse of lindsay in a world the timing was on the interaction with the cast was superb and everything just fell into place but then again that film also benefitted from a knockout script by a knockout writer tina fey just my luck has none of these things going for it perhaps ironically lohan 's latest vehicle is quite an unlucky choice for her we have a promising premise in the concept of a boy and girl with opposing luck lohan is lucky chris pine is not inevitably through the courses of movie magic we know that the two will end up trading places much like eddie murphy and dan akroyd once did in what was the name of that movie again the only mystery for the viewer is whether this will occur through a wise old asian or a wise old gypsy spoiler it 's the gypsy ! ok i know i should n't be giving these things away ! like i said we all know this is going to happen what we did n't know was that it was going to take minutes to get there ! so we kill one full third of the movie being bombarded with example after example of lohan 's good luck and pine 's bad luck by the time they make the switch i had already lost interest and was planning my lunch after the predictable bout of sudden bad luck lohan learns that an kiss with pine was what caused the change of fortune problem is the kiss was at a masquerade party and she does n't know whom she kissed what follows is perhaps the film 's only somewhat enjoyable sequence as lohan tracks down and ambushes 20 strangers with sudden and embarassingly public kisses trying to get her luck back sadly this brief bright spot ends too quickly and it is back to the formula as lohan and pine meet and fall in love anyway not knowing that they are the ones who caused each other 's luck to change if predictable make you happy you might find some charm in this final third of the film that is if you can overlook the sudden need for lohan 's best friend to become a in what was obviously a what do we do with the final act '' storyline with positively no beforehand the problem with this film is that it comes across as very '' to borrow from mad tv it was just made in ten days is the director to blame while donald petrie has a few hits to his name miss congenialty grumpy old men and mystic pizza he also has more than a few duds the associate welcome to mooseport my favorite martian or perhaps it is the writing team to date the two credited writers have yet to muster up a single true hit and one gets the sense that a more competent writing team would have taken a better direction with the plot and have not wasted the obvious talent that lohan does in fact possess personally i would have liked to have seen the producers take a risk and make lohan a much more loathsome character to begin with than she is her character comes off as too nice to hate and yet too shallow to root for whoever is to blame this is clearly a effort at best and one i hope lindsay or her casting agent will learn from with four movies coming down the pike she still has a shot at transitioning into a much more serious career i like that she has taken smaller ensemble roles recently such as prairie home companion and bobby a very smart play on her part let 's hope she can steer clear of just my luck roles for awhile ||| 0
i liked this movie but i also did n't like it the story line was very predictable i saw a similar movie of true movies the acting was fairly good it does go to show how ignorant people are when it comes to watching this movie i realise why many rapes go unreported ||| 0
every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known in it that everything will turn out good blue steel is one of those movies jamie lee curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties or should i say murders which she did not commit sounds like an interesting plot right it would be had the script not been so poorly written the supporting actors give such a performance that not even jamie lee could have saved the dialogue aside from the acting the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop jamie lee is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her so why do i give blue steel an extra star well i 'll just say that if you are a fan of jamie lee curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television just do n't pay over 3 to rent it and certainly do n't buy it ||| 0
this is just like an updated b movie from the sixties and i enjoyed it it 's real comic book stuff the effects are not bad the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it 's easy viewing i enjoyed this more than big budget films such as evolution or jurassic park 3. but i think the absence of big names will put people off not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job and if big names do n't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this ||| 0
i love adam sandler well i used to love him before he made eight crazy nights not only was this cartoon not funny it was downright trash i would not recommend this feature '' to anyone eight crazy nights '' was short on story long on time and wearing on patience i kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself i needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that i will never get back needless to say i stuck it out until the credits and now i have to live with the facts that i 1 watched the movie and 2 i 'll never get that time back so now i sit here typing away a review i doubt anyone will read wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie ! humbug ! watch ishtar '' you 'll get more out of it oh and i only awarded one star because amazon insists you give everything at least one star i did this under protest ||| 0
death tunnel began with promise early in the movie we were treated to some unique visuals wonderful music and a good feel them the actors opened their mouths and death tunnel fell apart death tunnel is the story of 5 college girls who seeking an initiation into a party clique are picked into a hazing ceremony which leads them to an old hospital where white plague victims were slaughtered the building holds much more than they suspect including angry and dull ! ghosts from here the madness ensues and the blood flows death tunnel drags after the first 30 minutes and holds few frights the story gets dull once the girls are trapped for nothing really happens other than 45 minutes of filming tricks during this time we are tortured with an abundance of horrible acting some of the worst in an horror film i have seen this year the acting leaves you scratching your head wondering how any film studio will give a 2 million to make death tunnel and allow them to squander the money on junk talent and in the end that is what kills death tunnel pitiful acting the acting is scary the movie is n't run away from this stinker run very very far away and do n't look back total score out of 100 18 11 out of 50 enjoyment a rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film 0 out of 10 acting how good was the acting 2 out of 10 immersion did the movie suck me into the story 5 out of 10 intangibles special effects movie pace is the movie forgettable or something you will talk about and remember for weeks years 0 out of 10 must see is this movie worth 0 out of 10 must buy is this movie a must ||| 0

this is not a movie in a classic sense this is a set of interviews of dj 's promoters i 'm fine with that however the djs that participates are not the best representations of the electronic industry where is paul oakenfold paul van dyk sasha digweed dave seaman deep dish dj dan and countless other famous dj 's i understand that the budget might have been too small to invite one of those dj 's mentioned above for an interview or so but in this movie there are lots of dj 's that are not that well representative of an industry that 's becomming smaller and smaller for your money 's worth buy a breakbeat dance video where you will be more entretained than a documental wan na ||| 0
first off let me say that this is a great collection of really bad movies the selection spans several of the classic age you 've got gamera movies hercules movies outer space movies the whole gamut unfortunately the sound is very bad and the movies are not closed captioned as an individual with a hearing problem the soundtrack was almost indecipherable due to the constant hum that permeates most of the transfers the video is also problematic but no where near as bad as the sound ||| 0
bearing in mind that the 50 movie pack line is what it is packages of films i have to say that sci fi classics is not up to the level of mystery classics and horror classics which i also own i 've watched everything in the mystery and horror sets and while the latter is padded with flicks that properly belong in the former i did n't feel cheated by either moreover some of the films included such as detour impact bluebeard and too late for tears actually are classics of a sort deserving of repeated viewings only about 36 of the 50 films included in sci fi classics remotely qualify as science fiction or even as sci fi '' and the only classics '' among them are famous or infamous on the order of robot monster teenagers from outer space mesa of lost women and santa claus conquers the martians the balance comprises strongman epics hercules and the tyrant of babylon and jungle epics white pongo queen of the amazons and clyde beatty 's lost jungle if you simply must have copies of programmers such as unknown world horrors of spider island and the incredible petrified world on hand for those occasions when the day the earth stood still does n't ring your chimes you 'll like this package otherwise beware ||| 0
kiefer sutherland stars in heat ' a crime drama in which the star of hit tv series ' can show more tender side of the character than he is often associated with he plays pally boston cop who is forced to retire because of the heart problem and his acting is very good overall however there is not much that i can recommend in heat ' except some nice touch in showing the characters the film tries to include as many things as possible but few of them really materialize the story looks rather like a familiar one because of his early retirement pally starts to drink and even thinks of committing suicide his relationship with his estranged wife charlotte rhada mitchell is not going well and he is not happy to know that she is now going out with someone else but charlotte is also nice and caring so she persuades pally 's brother ray anthony lapaglia to visit him ray who is accused of not being a citizen by his too earnest brother has a good plan to make money easily and offers it to pally it is about buying a racehorse cheap he says and it is an easy job because he happens to know that the horse which has not win any races recently is actually misdiagnosed only suffering from a polyp a small operation can remove when everything is going well things get suddenly complicated because of a jockey tony lothaire bluteau from here the story snowballs into blackmail caper and even murder but the film 's overall tone is always light not taking itself very seriously unfortunately for all their effective acting from sutherland lapaglia mitchell and bluteau the weak and unsure direction totally fails to give momentum to the otherwise unremarkable film it is not funny when it tries to make us funny and it is not romantic when it tries to be romantic feeble direction simply misses several good opportunities to make good use of the jockey 's sullen little daughter sam kay panabaker her feature debut who could have been a little surprise or gem in this unconvincing plot it is true that kiefer sutherland shows in heat ' another side of acting talent which is less eccentric and intense than most of the roles he had played or he would play that is good news and the only good news here ||| 0
delmer daves ' mediocre direction of the sequel to the equally pathetic film the robe '' starring richard burton a totally contrived film that demonstrates no competence in either screenplay direction acting or historical accuracy of any sort avoid at all costs unless you 're expecting to see it as a comedy compared to kubrik 's incredible direction for 'spartacus ' a few years later the gladiatorial scenes in this film are second rate even the low budget film 'barabas ' with anthony quinn had better direction than this worthless film the screenplay is contrived the script is worthless and the acting utterly shallow from everyone on this film at least 'the robe ' had richard burton victor mature continues to act as if he just came out of a cocktail lounge after a few martinis too many jay robinson continues his idiotic and ridiculous performance of caligula as if the character were a retarded bufoon instead of the diabolical genius of cruelty and perversion see hurt 's performance in the bbc 's 'i claudius ' to see how a good actor handles this character in short reading the new testament or going to a church sermon is far more entertaining and historically faithful than watching this garbage film just the fact that victor 'manure ' is in this film says it all ignore this pathetic film and watch 'spartacus ' 'barabas ' or even the fantasized 'gladiator ' for some good gladiatorial films as for biblical films 'ben hur ' 'the ten commandments ' or 'quo vadis ' are films that are worth watching much more than this putrid hollywood junk ||| 0

controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate strangers with all their flaws abundantly clear meeting once a week for encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate '' tawdry pathetic feel of their relationship naturally one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later anonymity is not good enough anymore ||| 0

i bought this dvd based on the review of it on the dvd drive in web site either the person who reviewed it has never seen an exploitation movie before or was not old enough to view one in the first place he made it sound like the most graphic and disturbing prison movie ever you would have thought it compared to the 'ilsa ' movies the way this guy went on about it i 'm not sure what movie he saw but it was n't this one when the most extreme scene in the movie involves a person being shot at falling over bloodlessly like an old western you have to wonder why exactly it merited an unrated '' version i guess it 's worth it if you want to see naked women dancing around in a circle but it you want to see a gritty violent movie buy something else ||| 0
ernest borgnine would be spinning in his grave if he were dead there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie ! the actors should be embarrassed ! i could only stomach 25 minutes of viewing and it was about as funny as a viewing in a mortuary i ca n't believe i paid 9.99 for this dvd what a fool i was learn from my mistake ||| 0
the reason the original iron chef '' was such an awesome show was entirely due to the bad translation and over the top voice acting therefore without these elements it becomes a pathetic charade of the original program i was at one time a hardcore cult fan of iron chef '' because of the hilarious voice overs and true foreign zest of chairman kaga and the gang i really did n't care much for the cooking or whatever food was being prepared the real heart of the show was the voiceovers and the mad zesty zeal with which the japanese chefs went over something as inane as cooking i loved iron chef '' in much the same way as i loved the original mystery science theater 3000 '' they were both quirky tv cult shows that gave a certain sense of community among their hardcore fans this new show really does n't cut it in any way shape or form i 'm not being unpatriotic or anything i 'm just saying why this new show is so weak also i noticed that once the translators of the original show started figuring out the show was a huge hit they ruined their own voiceacting by being all self concious the original few seasons of the first iron chef '' are where it 's at ! once again i do n't watch this show for the cooking i watch it for the odd bizarre translations and cheesy voiceacting ||| 0
do not confuse this with the real thing i found teh vhs of this for 1 at a store near me i was interested so i got it i watch iron chef on the food network evey night and this dosent even begin to hold a candle to it ! the one commentator is a failed comedian and the other is a culinary half wit ! i never heard more ussless facts in a span in my life the chefs in the first baattle were for lack of a better term dissrespectful i mean come on how are you gon na have a cell phone on you and answer it during a cooking battle ! they kept cutting away from the cooking to show interview clips with the chefs the cooks were pretty good they had a decent talent but we didnt get to see as much of it here as you do on the real show there flour reporter keeps bugging them thru out the whole thing asking questionspassed down from the dumb kept tryign to play shatner off as a culinary genius but come on we all know that he is nothing but a medeocore actor side of star trek or wat ever he was on the only you see shatner is when he is talking about clearly prewritten statements that sound kinda incoherant lol all in all i give this 2 stars and that purely gose ot the merit of the chefs not to the shows them selfs unless your a shatner fanatic or sone won thats just kinnda like its cooking i 'll watch it '' but be warned its not as good as it could be glad i only spen 1 on it bc its truely not worth more ||| 0
you know shrek 2 is the embarassment of american culture what 's wrong with it you ask let 's see too much slapstick humor too many movie references or parodies and an unforgiving act of making fun of or parodying classic disney characters ! ! ! that 's just unbelievable dreamworks ! disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry and you just make fun of them that 's a real shame you should be thanking disney for all what animation offers nowadays disney classics have heart humor and a beautiful story shrek 2 lacks that shrek 2 deserves to be taken away from everybody and stored in a government facility never to be seen again ! ! ||| 0
when the lead character acts like she 's sleepwalking through the entire film that 's distracting ! when just about anyone from my high school 's drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth then it 's time to open up the wallet and hire better talent once you get past the special affects all which use cheesy models this godforsaken movie is boring as sin or should i say mud ! beside being preposterous for example the meteroid or whatever only hits a dam in its first strike this pitiful film is also delusional ! remember the scene where the head of fema risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire as hurricane katrinia proves there is no such thing as a bureaucratic administrator hero ! instead this movie comes off as a piece of federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time ||| 0
this dvd was horrible i did n't know what to expect but after the first 10 minutes i was thinking is this it ! what 's going on where are they what am i watching after awhile i clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary nothing they do n't even tell you where they are ! it 's basically a 45 minute music video and the music although i like it does n't fit with the footage at all i really do n't understand the point of this project i watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding total waste of time and money and i am a jack johnson fan ||| 0
during a missing persons investigation a cop samuel jackson gets kidnapped by a gang of thieves meanwhile an elaborate bank robbery is about to go down of course samuel does great as always but the script and especially the very slow pace brings it down what sounded like a good movie turned out to be a dissapointment far from being the worst movie you can rent but it 's just not as good as it sounds maybe next time they wo n't take all day to get started ||| 0
i started liking this movie i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal underground '' cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late if you like the depressing gritty wild fastpaced style of this movie check out the original master robert crumb toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of this is crap in noncomformity and dont say i didnt get it '' i just think hes being hugely and this whole thing is an homage gone awry lacking the wit psychedelia and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly ||| 0

this has got to be the biggest stinker in denzel 's long movie career just after the oscar winning philadelphia he went on to star in this cult sci fi movie based on machines outsmarting mankind in a virtual reality game russel crowe also stars in this very and i mean very bad movie but hey if you 're a sci fi fan watch this but do n't expect high rated acting from any of the two big stars on account this movie did n't make any sufficent funds at the box office and was later labeled by the hollywood critic the only movie with two lead star to not hit the box office this low budget sleepy movie is n't worth watching if you love sci fi that outakes the life of machines aginst the human race pick up a true 5 star hollywood material like ' 'terminator ' 'i ' 'ii ' 'iii ' or will smith 's new movie 'i robot' ||| 0
where to start with this bad movie as if the plot matters it does n't the movie is about a woman and her sister who use hubbie 's computer to access chat rooms etc and witness online killings and of course see the killer in a sort of eyes of laura mars '' style the two lead males are played by musicians roger daltrey and huey lewis lead females are played by former actresses natassia kinsky and nicolette sheridan the killer is played by a actor major problems 1. talking computers electronic chronometer activated '' 2. people talking to computers as they type 3. never making a typo even when typing at an awkward angle and not looking at the keys while talking to someone else 4. easy access to talking encrypted computer by using a microphone that you have to be an inch away from to use and the computer selects only some of the words you say as needed 5. really bad acting 6. eroticism 7. thoughout it might seem tempting to save '' 5 bucks but you 're wasting the other five dollars ||| 0
i am referring to the laser light dvd edition of this film which promises the best digital transfer of the film that is great but they used the worst print anyone could concieve to transfer ! i taped this off of television awhile back and decided to buy a dvd version and this is 100 times worse than the version i taped myself on the slowest speed off of late night tv ! in reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better vhs version and i would recommend that over this do not be fooled like i was with the fine condition of welles ' the trial '' by laser light or the pipe smoking picture packaging of this this version of arkardin is a total waste of money ||| 0

the award winning documentary freestyle looks like something fresh creative and new from the exterior i was psyched to purchase this dvd the minute i heard about it what a let down ! first of all how did freestyle achieve all of the acclaim and all of these film festival awards secondly who picked it as a winner probably some cornball who is n't familiar with the culture or good off the dome mcing this documentary tries really hard to connect to the audience and present the validity of rhyming off the dome but falls completely flat the film is n't balanced enough to a certain degree what you basically have is nothing more than a bunch of tree huggin backpackers spitting nothing but junk and 10 syllable words off the top of their heads for a majority of the film do n't get me wrong there are some credible scenes in freestyle with mos def biggie black thought and the last poets not enough freestyle tries to come off as some profound documentary but sheds very little light to the subject and the questions that many heads have asked for years why was n't the current trend of fake freestyles writtens coming off as freestyles addressed more why were n't more credible mc 's exposed and quality underground mc 's presented why is there a section entitled '' what kind of oxymoron is that it makes no sense why is there a section on freestyle djing what ! ! ! is n't that called turntabalism it seems as if they 're fishing for more topics that ultimately do n't have much of a direct relation to rhyming off the top is there a freestyle graffiti section too freestlye continuously fails and derails itself off track from the key subject the art of freestyling at times it tries to be a hip hop 101 dvd most of the people who will be purchasing the dvd are already familiar with hip hop 's roots in the south bronx where is the quality freestyling at ultimately freestyle '' is with extremely weak amateur mc 's who need to focus more on spitting quality off the dome freestyles they cover supernatural 's sorry a for almost half of the entire dvd which is very unfortunate i admire his creativity but he sounds terrible it 's no wonder why he ca n't get signed he thinks his does n't stink because he 's studied the dictionary to help expand his vocabulary for freestyling but yet he ca n't take the time to concentrate on getting out of the broom closet that he lives in i thought that this film could have benefited from more footage of proven vets who can truly freestyle such as kool keith tribe big daddy kane snoop kurrupt common safir likwit crew redman or anyone from hieroglyphics these aforementioned artists can really '' freestyle that would have faired much better than watching these tofu eatin incense burnin soy milk drinkin poetry night geeks struggle to put words together the eminem rap olympics footage from 1997 would have been great too ultimately if you are familiar with culture or a new fan of the underground scene then you will love freestyle if you consider your self a fan of hip hop culture and familiar with the topic of freestyle rhyming then you will be somewhat disappointed just like i was if you want a quality hip hop dvd purchase check out the mc '' scratch '' or hip hop immortals '' take my word for it i 'm rating this with 2.5 stars mainly for the rare footage of artists such as kool moe dee bahamadia biggie smalls the roots craig g and kool herc ||| 0

i love asian movies i like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of hollywood these days 2047 however was the first asian movie that i failed to finish becaase of the sheer boredom of the plot do n't get me wrong the main actor clark gable is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous but the movie itself imo is overrated you can argue art '' all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you not my bag at all i kept hoping the movie was over at several points only to my god it 's not over ! boring ||| 0

five yuppies yup they 're old enough to be that now reunite for the funeral of one of their friends what ensues is a parody of the big chill complete with bad music then mysterious bugs that disintegrate in bright light start infesting them one by one turning them into murderous zombies so far so eccentric and the satire is sometimes very funny the fx are so however and the plotting so loose that the film loses direction and winds uup just going through the motions in the last after a rather promising zach galligan must have been really hungry for work when he chose to do this movie the menu is basic and the only extras are trailers for infested anaconda and the creature features series i like the wit now if only a bit more attention had been paid to the horror plot and we might have something here ||| 0

'the sword and the sorcerer ' released in is a mixed bag of positive and negative the negative the production values are marginal the picture quality overall dark and grainy the dialogue does n't fair any better it 's also dull and uninspired as for the storyline well i found it extremely uneven with some parts of the movie excruciatingly slow and others quite good the positive lee horsley is surprisingly engaging as the vagabound warrior prince talon and kathleen beller is breathtaking as princess alana she 's never looked better the film is worth at least one watch just to see kathleen in her prime there are also numerous other very lovely ladies such as anna bjorn in this production that will keep all the young male viewers interest peaked cast includes richard moll george maharis richard lynch simon mccorkindale and robert tessier one of the great tough guys in film ||| 0
except for the presence of kevin bacon whom i like a lot this would have been a real loser there were so many things wrong directed by paul glaser with no surprises no depth of character a too hollywood scenario you knew what was coming a mile away there was good cinematography and music and kevin bacon is always appealing but that 's the best i can say oh and the nun she was pretty good too the lead black man was also engaging the problem was really the script too pat and too many unbelievable things that screamed hollywood '' like when the village burned down they were ready to just up and leave where they 'd lived for generations as if it takes generations to rebuild their houses and there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game and bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain get cut in the groin then play basketball all on a rotten knee please ||| 0

i hate to be the dissenting voice here but the boost is one of the most hilariously bad cliched and pictures i 've seen in a long while it 's so silly it unintentionally wanders into john waters territory several times the thing is james woods acts like he 's on coke before his character starts doing coke so when he actually starts the coke binge the movie enters a hyperreal realm of ridiculousness still it has its moments such as sean young falling down a flight of stairs and having a miscarriage or woods explaining that cocaine just takes your natural energy and amplifies it '' a good title would be national lampoon 's cautionary cocaine tale of the '' ||| 0
this movie does a very good job of portaying an alcoholic that has not yet found the program of alcoholics anonymous the aa meetings in this movie are packed with self centered selfish and restless irrtable and discontented people who meet to share their misery real aa meetings offer experience strength and hope and the solution to how an alcoholic can live happy lives without alcohol ||| 0
when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good bad this one is n't a very good story this mess came out at the heigth of the slasher '' movie frenzy but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also the theme of 4 kids who now hold on here think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival before you can say please kill me '' the thing '' is picking them off one by one with only 4 teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen but no they just go for the tease scares and even at 90 mins this bore last to long ||| 0
antonio banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you ca n't believe he ever got wealthy when he 's running around giving money freely to a woman angelina jolie who lied to him from the moment they met she did n't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry well we never get to see the pretty girl because jolie must have killed her too the only reason this woman is hot '' is because she 'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody if you 've seen gia you 'll know what i mean neither she or banderas who is n't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent have any chemistry and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her my guess the age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed and all the sex in this movie gets old fast it 's so stupid because nobody has interludes like that unless they 're shooting a blue movie the only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot you can see right through this silly waste of two hours you 'll never get back this adaptation from waltz into darkness was remade especially for the purpose of exploiting two celebrities with highly sensual images and nothing more this movie is as bad as showgirls and one star less than beyond the valley of the dolls because at least beyond is badly funny in an entertaining way not only is their relationship devoid of any true sense of love but you also get this overwhelming desire to see creepy unconvincing billy played horribly by thomas jane get the girl billy what a stupid name for a bad guy but i guess it would n't make a difference even if his name was ralph or percival early on in the movie the beauty forget what else wants to see a really bad theater group and a friend of theirs comments on what a cheap mellowdrama is being presented my thoughts about original sin exactly the plot is stupid and the dialogue is so bad it 's over the top in the end the movie makes absolutely no sense and you wish you would get a payoff but you do n't the rat poison does n't do its job and neither does the executioner all i really am sure of is that with all the rape scenes that jolie 's horrible character seems to enjoy and her portrayal of a woman who 's asking for it constantly that women should find this movie grossly offensive and degrading to our gender and i 'm not even a feminist ! as for studmuffin banderas he really has no business in front of a camera because his acting scope is on par with the little boy who was in problem child with john ritter however he is a good director crazy in alabama heed my advice and avoid original sin the two hours you waste on it will be unforgivable ||| 0
can someone please tell me where to get the dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles the recent hong kong legends release is crazy chinese audio or english audio but no english subtitles ! i have the original chinese subtitled the subtitles are imbedded version of this movie on a universe vcd and based on the merits of its available chinese subtitles alone it is a better movie by magnitudes than the one s commercially available to the hapless market the english dubbing on this dvd even though well synchronized with the actors ' lips takes so much away from the film nevertheless especially its '' which is a major reason i enjoy this movie genre take for example the scene where our hero first returns to jing woo school after learning of his master 's death and sees first senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master after handily defeating the challenger first senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the english soundtrack completely and deplorably misses also at the very end of the release film chen says he is going back to his japanese girlfriend in the original hong kong release he actually goes off to fight the japanese with the resistance movement between these two examples there are many such gross audio enough at least to take three stars away from an otherwise martial arts film the best of jet li 's filmography and perhaps the best of the modern '' martial arts genre period the same criticism holds true for jet li 's the tai chi master released in the as the twin warriors it 's an english soundtrack superimposed over a chinese movie often stripping the film of its unique cultural forcing the film through an american '' template and reducing the potential for mental as opposed to strictly visceral enjoyment to a pitiful minimum we end up with a film typically devoid of humor character development and silver screen intimacy '' a film precariously out of balance with and far flung from its careful directorial intent if you value the full content visible and audible of chinese martial arts films but lack facility in the host language then the next best thing is a original language version and this release clearly is not that by a long long long shot ||| 0
this film itself deserves 4 stars at least im givin this a one cause its a bootleg i tried to play it in 3 different dvd players to include an and it would not play then when i finally got it to play it looks like one of those copies that got transfered from tape to disk and it looks and sounds like if your into purchasing like that then i guess this is for you i advise you to cop this movie somewhere else ||| 0
i just finished the book it is a masterpiece i wish i could say the same for the bbc series for one the musical score is either absent or irritating so much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the characters how about or something else music let the audience in on the torment and conflict of raskolnikov the main character and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book what i saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film i 've written much more but it 's unfortunately been truncated simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book this is a dreary protrayal ||| 0
i thought that this movie would be pretty interesting the previews for it made it seem like it was funny i however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid the charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground also the running time was too long it says it was just a little over 2 hours but to me it felt like much more ||| 0
this is i suppose anybody who 'd hire adam sandler tea leone lacks the ability to create anything that we who are descended from cro magnon man could watch i lasted 20 minutes the jokes '' are older than me and they were n't funny when they were born there is a world that exists nowhere except in american tv and film it 's an ugly place where nobody acts human preferring to cling to stale stereotypes a place where writers without talent set their stories a place they grew up watching on american tv and in films thus perpetuating the vicious cycle this film is set in that world no human being has ever been to this place because it only exists in the minds of hacks from the writer and director who brought us broadcast news which i reviewed recently it too was in the pretend world but that was okay because it was a film about a tv show and it had a bit of wit and perception this has none of either it 's a damn shame this is the only way cloris leachman can get work ||| 0

teenagers plan a mock crime for kicks on the same day criminals knock off a bank for real and their paths cross i can understand implying that two have or had a homosexual relationship but to lace an entire movie with cheap and to stoop so low as to give a lead male character a female first name is a trifle ridiculous ok director we 'get it ' all men are secretly gay ! you made your point move on ! i ca n't even imagine that a person of same gender orientation could possibly find this film the least bit interesting much less stimulating for an intelligent crime caper with a subplot see bound '' since this movie is supposed to take place in wisconsin they give the locals a southern accent an absolute bore ||| 0

date movie should be shown to all captured al qaeda prisoners only terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish let me be perfectly clear about this date movie may be the worst movie ever made it 's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of you may cry you may scream you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here not once it does n't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks the only thing i got out of this movie was an awful headache if you ask me everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years if not for life had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to date movie he would have stayed in the ocean whatever happened to that sweet and charming girl we came to know during the first couple of years of buffy the vampire slayer why and how did it ever come to this alyson hannigan humiliating herself in such raunchy tasteless unoriginal drivel she can still light up the screen with that smile of hers and she certainly put a lot into her performance but i 'm embarrassed for her here she plays an overweight very disgusting waitress from a mixed family boy is it mixed who is desperate to find her prince charming after convincing hitch tony cox to help her find love she 's given a complete overhaul literally plunked down into a reality dating show and actually finds a man we watch them go through the dating stage the meet the stage and the wedding stage encountering a number of obstacles to their future happiness really though the story is unimportant all the script cares about are stereotypes toilet humor and things that make you go yuck there 's no joke too hackneyed no visual too disgusting and no dialogue too stupid to throw in the mix i 'm generally a fan of dumb comedies and ridiculous spoofs but this mess does n't even qualify for the genre date movie is so utterly atrocious that you ca n't even laugh at it it 's a complete and utter failure in every way possible ||| 0
date movie is from two of the six writers of scary movie apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter a few chuckles here and there but that 's all date movie is a spoof of romantic comedies simply that idea sounds good right the writers had alot to work with but they failed miserably alyson hannigan plays the main character julia jones personally not a big fan of her comedy now eddie griffin jennifer coolidge and fred willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop this might be enjoyed by some but only a few for me a big comedy fan it was pretty bad in general i actually watched it at the theaters and my friends it was the biggest waste of ten dollars in my life ! it is now out on dvd and someone will have to pay me to watch it again ok maybe not pay me but at least pay for the movie one measly star ||| 0
do n't get me wrong i 'm a fierce but the stupidity of this movie is just unbearable all the american clichs about russians and ussr are reunited here and it should be studied at school as an example of gross caricature the ridiculous russian language imitations the dissenters presented as freedom soldiers '' whereas a child knows today they never used violence as a mean to achieve their goals the jews presented as traitors the scientist 's wife looks like ethel rosenberg the idea of stealing so easily such a weapon the reaction of secretary general and not premier to send another firefox whereas he could just use this incident to accuse the united states of stealing if you should see an intelligent cold war movie check out white nights it 's a shame it is n't on dvd yet or the protocol far more intelligent than this gross highly unprobable childish parody the chase star wars like '' scene is way too long and looks dated today clint eastwood shame on you ||| 0

watching this movie i am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible and make it drag out on the screen the disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be and how poor direction and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness i wo n't even go into historical inaccuracies or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject the audience and history instead of respect ||| 0
every minute characters in this series try to remind you of some plot point as if you 're a span coach potatoe ehhh ah yes you are well watch this and your life will pass by quicklier than already does two or three nice ideas the rest is very superficial and underutilized probably there was an exec there that keeped destroying the good work of other people what i would do with a tenth of the budget of this misfire ! ||| 0
some juvenile delinquent girl gets in trouble with the cops she 's sent to gymnastics camp she used to be a sickeningly famous gymnast before she became a worthless slacker she thinks everything and everyone is really really stupid she does nothing but argue with everyone all the time it 's all her parents fault of course because she 's perfect her dialogue consists of nothing but remarks that she says in that oh so cute '' way that fans of lizzie mcguire may find clever good grief this is just beyond unwatchable even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds it just grates on your nerves until you 're about ready to shove the dvd through the paper shredder ||| 0

i remember taking a minute of my time to watch this dung when it premiered a couple years back and lets just say i find watching something download more than this i swear i hate preps the most in this country yesterday i was at the mall going to the unspecified phone company lot to cancel my vonage service vonage sucks do not listen to what they say on tv ! i ca n't begin to describe how horrible vonage is ! but to get there i had to venture through the worst part of the mall as i carried the phone bill i crept past the windows without a peep i then leaped from fake palm tree to fake palm tree infront of the abercrombie fitch store which was infested with teen girls and their boy friends that think wearing pink is hot '' i then slid down a railing and fell a couple feet short of the jamba juice stand i picked myself up with my remaining strength and threw the smoke bomb i had in my pocket infront me thus disappearing from the mindless zombies drinking their elixir with the down 4 life playing in the background squash 'n ' squeak below me speaks only the truth ! listen to him too ! it may be hard for you star reviewers to accept the fact but then again you ca n't handle it anyways come to your friggen senses and stop wasting you money on this garbage it 's enough acting like you do already but then you go and spend money on this litter to watch other people act like you do ! god damn ||| 0
the last time i saw the names adam goldberg '' and giovanni ribisi '' together they were two american soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain private ryan goldberg and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long at times towards the end i was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to memento '' or something of that nature what this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning despite a stellar cast that besides rabisi also features jason lee christina ricci vince vaughn haylie duff and elvis costello it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey rabisi stars as gray evans a movie star actor who is having marital trouble gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set going through fan email and getting bugged by people that a fan is stalking him relentless in his obsession of this belief he starts obsessing about others around him great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales we understand that gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time of being the stalker but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring the ideas are there i just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all the sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat if you like independent films or want to try something different by all means give it a try i do n't see it as being something i would watch again or have in my collection for killing time on a sunday afternoon with ||| 0

most of the characters in this movie are great the scenes the costumes and everything but i did n't like the outcome of the story i felt daniel changed somewhat after discovering his past and i could n't understand his abandonment of his former love in order to persue a life with that new girl to be honest i never liked gwendolyn 's character at all she was selfish self centered and annoying yet towards the end i felt very sorry for her after all she 'd gone through for daniel and he seemed to have just forgotten all that which happened between them it 's just what you expect once you discover the jewish factor involved ||| 0
despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie this is really pretty sick stuff with little or no redeeming social context objectively sick just is n't erotic no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so those who think differently really ought to either a focus a little more b examine their true motives or c get a life ||| 0
how i made it through this poorly executed poorly written sequel i have no idea catherine 's in trouble again and people she meets are dying who 's the murderer catherine the shrink who lusts over her or the cop who 's so eager to toss her into the clink and throw away the key catherine certainly gets around she manages to befriend the most unlikely of people all associates or or enemies of the shrink and most of them end up dead is she trying to drive the shrink nuts or does she plan to kill him this movie makes little sense it does n't thrill or tantalize and it offers sharon stone in an unflattering light as a cold seductress with little to offer but mindless sex but then that seems to be her best role does n't it it does n't work this time around and the only realism is in stone 's sneer it looked all too natural ||| 0
from a big jt brit and fan this dvd is soooo disappointing the dvd is comprised of whole episodes of and very little of the episodes has britney justin or christina featured there is only one song where brit and justin sing a duet and only one where christina sings other than that all they basically show are lame hometown profiles '' which last about 60 seconds each you get better content from a behind the music '' or driven '' episode there 's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely nothing to do with britney justin or christina lame lame lame and disappointing i think the total time of real content is about 12 minutes save your money ||| 0
they should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre this series should have been killed off by now the first was not even worth watching ! stay away from this whole movie series ||| 0
being a texas chainsaw fan i of course picked this one up it has 2 big stars in it and was directed by one of the writers of the original i 'm not sure what they were going for in this one is it a horror a sick comedy it is all over the place what is worse is that they made leatherface a wimpy crossdresser the ending leaves you scratching your head mathew and renee do their best with the material ||| 0
this is my vote for worst movie ever made its dumb theres no violence hardly no blood and i actually got a headache from renee now i look chinese screaming for and watching how bad the acting is this is like a drug that doesnt work and now i want my 3 dollars and of my life back ||| 0

i do n't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length once again cheap fox wo n't buy the music rights there is sections i think that have been either doctored or just cut out you 'll be watching an episode and you 'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment you 'll think it 's your eyes but it 's not thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color even though my review is n't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on so they 're all still worth buying ||| 0

yul brynner stalks about like he 's in westworld acting smoking every chance he gets steve mcqueen as always is terrible as for the rest of the 7 '' their acting is atrocious to only eli wallach walks away unscathed yet if these things are irritating it is the blatantly sexist and racist undertones to the entire affair that just make it heinous yul brynner actually says that he might '' rape the women of the town in one scene sarcastically amazing this could have ever been construed as being tough '' it 's just ridiculous and these distinctions are what sepeartes this pathetic remake from the masterpiece it shames but i 'll give it one extra star for being relatively well staged and directed ||| 0
not as good as the first one and pretty forgetable has none of the living comic book '' charm that i loved in the first one that and there are only three stories and more animation only the blob in the water one was worth watching if you see it watch for the joint that the blonde guy pulls out of nowhere after swimming to the raft in a speedo ! funny romero and king seemed to not be as enthused as they were when making the first one i just didnt like it skip it and get the first one ||| 0
3 short films ! ! thats it i feel severly ripped off even after i picked this up used ! it feels like the skits that didnt make creephow 1 were mushed together onto this chief wooden head isnt scary at all if you think that is scary you are easily frightened the raft is defiantely the best on here by far that blob thing does creep me out i shall admit especially the ending to it ! ! the hitchhiker is so stupid i felt moronic for viewing this there is nothing scary or funny about a bloody zombie that says thanks for the ride lady '' over and over i just want to know why anchor bay released a stellar edition if this heap of scrap when they could have done creepshow 1 instead that one is better two stars for the raft '' if only they all held up like that ||| 0
well if this movie had a story then i must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it they do n't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that 's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking as one of the reviewer declared about 2 people having sex i do n't recommend it ||| 0

this line spoken by julie christie to dirk bogarde in darling '' just about sums up my feelings towards this movie although i am halfway done with this movie i think this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen and i am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing i am done with this movie believe it or not and it only got worse christie 's character diana scott marries an italian man who hello is old enough to be father ! and oh yes he 's an aging prince in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to grace kelly and what would happen to jacqueline kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her princess diana '' almost made me laugh that nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my tv a la elvis presley considering that this is the same setup that occurs in georgy girl '' and that is spoiled british girl living in swinging england marries older man three words anna nicole smith also i would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that christie deserved the oscar for best actress she did n't at all because it should and i mean should of gone to julie andrews for the sound of music '' my pick for the best movie of the 1960 's because not only did she overtake her performance of mary poppins '' for which she won the oscar she pulverized every performance by a female that year including christie and there 's a problem with the academy they ca n't seem to pull the trigger in giving oscars to the same person i 'm not alone in this arugment in danny perry 's book alternate oscars '' he picks andrews for best actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the ampas gave the oscar to christie was not because it was 'the british invasion ' but they saw it as a way to give an oscar to christie 's other film doctor zhivago '' which was 's rival and added to the fact that zhivago '' had no acting nominations there 's another oscar problem they do n't know when to be hip also does it seem like dirk bogarde and lawrence harvey were the two worst actors in film history because it seems to me that every movie that i have seen with them are bad weather it was this movie or the manchurian candidate '' with harvey or modesty blaise '' with bogarde in conclusion i think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an oscar or as what bogarde said to christie a fitting way to close this review since that i end where it begins i do n't take taxis that are filled with whores ! ||| 0
if you own or have watched the blue planet '' series you 're going to recognize all of the footage why because you 've already seen it except this time it 's going to be without the informative narrative for those of you who just want to watch a nature movie with very little talking then i guess this is for you the only reason i 'm giving this two stars is because the reused footage is incredible i do n't particularly appreciate being misled by the advertising i was expecting something new not the recycled and repackaged presentation i got ||| 0
i did n't think of it much as a movie as i did a porn frenzy i 'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know caligula was nuts otherwise then i guess so was all of the roman empire i simply can not believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy it was stupid simple and as soon as it was done i immediately threw it out not for the faint of heart not for the sophisticated either or anywhere in between ||| 0
this is the most tedious unfunny overrated movie of all time it 's interesting that this is from the same man who produced spaceballs which was actually rather humorous though also quite tedious at times i 'll always be at a loss to understand why people think it 's so funny his utter lack of subtlety is terrible to behold ||| 0

on the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama underneath however the director seems to have a couple of other themes going one thing that stood out to me is that the film is full of people who are caught between a rock and a hard place '' right from the start where childers has to choose between following the rules of war or saving his best friend he has a similar choice on the wall in yemin fire into the crowd or let the attack on his people continue i think he knew at that moment that his career was in the crapper jones ' character said as much during the trial whatever happens here this man will never command marines again '' the bad guy '' national security advisor was in a bind do what is best for america 's interests or back up the colonel the ambassador had to make a hard choice lie on the stand or lose his job his status his reputation even his wife had to decide whether to tell the truth or stand behind her husband 's story biggs the prosecutor got caught up in it he started out with the intent to prosecute what he was convinced was a legitimate case then got tossed a 'hot potato ' by the nsa right in open court childers ' captain lee had to decide whether to tell the truth or back his colonel and so on the itself seems to pit logic against emotion shades of star trek ! the differences are clearest in the closing arguements biggs is the joe friday just the facts '' type he presents the panel with this happened then b this happened and so on hayes ' whole arguement is based on emotion and then finally the jury is left with yet another hard decision i found the movie very interesting in terms of what is going on with the characters a lot of films are like this if you look a little deeper there 's more there than the surface story ||| 0
first off i do not dislike adam sandler i rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film not so much because i like raunchy antics but because of the underlying message adam sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this you can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting farting etc but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him he is loyal to his fans and to his friends ever notice how he always gives jobs to rob schneider and dana carvey no one else does that 's a good friend also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films he never sinks to there level either perhaps that is why ecn was such a creepy deeply disturbing film i can not in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies what was he thinking early on in the film his character a drunken loser belches very loudly in a chinese restaurant ok i go take shower now '' says chinese waiter i wanted to take a shower too very soon after that scene for starters sandler seems to think he is a voice over man he is not his idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard one can barely understand he is trying to do a character and he barely is also he is the voice of at least four of his characters he is equally bad in each perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something he coaches the kids basketball team he has been for years and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him he is simply there to be lovable and put upon he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face as is the humor here the script calls for sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end there is no real motivation for his bazaar cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them he starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures a menorah and a christmas thing i forget what it was he is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink i can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads surly even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book not here of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go the film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms he goes to the basketball game and insults the children ridiculing one boy for being fat the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants nice kitty kitty '' he squeaks what the then an angry father gets on sandlers bad side his only side and is force fed a jock strap i hope you like them extra sweaty '' ho ho ho for the next part of the film which seems like eight days crazy or otherwise his house is burned he pushes his benefactor down a hill in a porta potty which freezes feces on him he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth we are treated to this twice god bless us every one by the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs each worse then the last fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad if i move my bowls without using the spray 's a technical foul '' is one of few lines i remember thank you god by reading this one might assume as i did that this is irreverent in the good way poking fun at old christmas standards but it is not it is disgusting badly written annoying and very very cruel the two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly for no good reason with no motivation or payoff the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand this is not always a bad thing of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk a childhood trauma involving a car crash on hanukkah he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after the same can not be said for the audience why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate who is the audience there are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place the over all feel of the film is one of depressed sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness adam sandler has been loyal to his friends his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was even if it hurt his feelings this christmas turkey wo n't even work as leftovers bah humbug ||| 0
i bought this dvd because amy jo johnsen is in it one of my favorite actresses what i expected was a decent vampire movie with some blood and guts and a good storyline what i got was a movie with talking talking and more talking and a boring storyline i saw hardly any action hardly any fun and hardly anything interesting i was extremely disappointed in amy for starring in such a boring unintriguing movie the only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between seth and viki 's ex it was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations and useless talking if you are looking for a movie with some action and fun look elsewhere as much as i hate to put an amy jo movie down i am doing so ||| 0
although deleted scenes '' are promised on the back cover of the box there are no deleted scenes on the dvd instead there 's a perfunctory documentary '' which interviews the cast and other creators who recite a common litany of how much fun it was to make the film in this short segment there are a very few informal shots of the players that are n't in the film but there are no deleted scenes in the normal usage of the term rather disappointing since the cast in audio commentary talks about seemingly dozens of neat scenes that hopefully will be in the dvd deleted scenes section '' also although the box promises 2.35 wide screen '' the film is and only slightly letterboxed at about a 1.85 to 1 ratio some of the scenes are annoying because of the missing portion of the image also it 's not a gross teen comedy as the box copy suggests more of a romance with the four buddies '' comedy stuff as a sidebar which makes it potentially better i guess but it suffers from a lack of talent especially in ventimiglia 's acting and in the writing very anemic not much here in the key scenes the players just hem and haw since they 're not given much to say kevin kirkpatrick in a small part is way beyond the rest of the cast in acting sophistication he draws a very perceptive portrait extremely funny but not a typical caricature the most real character in the movie ||| 0

i was very disappointed in this dvd it was a dvd for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds the dvd was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details the ability to view details of color and details of wing tail bands etc would have offered a much better learning tool it also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations ||| 0

picasso is one of the giants in the history of art and surely the artistic genious of the century but this renders him boring and repetitive it was done while he was alive and has him painting '' little works '' that were done only for this dvd one after the ad nauseum this is picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist not the edgy artist genius of les demoiselles d'avignon and guernica it looks as if he 's painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work i turned it off after interminable minutes fortunately i rented it on netflix which i 'd recommend rather than buying it ||| 0
ok i am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as vampire assassin '' then i run into another bad movie lets face it this movie totally blows and what is with the main character and her cheesy fighting sound effects what was eva thinking when she decide to appear in this movie she was n't even the main star more like a background character with maybe 3 sentences to say and thats it please rent this one ||| 0
this review is based on the differences between the standard dvd disc and the superbit version only based on that i recommend that you save your money and get the standard version you 'll get more features while barely losing any audio or video quality which is the whole reason for buying a superbit disc in the first place i 've watched this movie on my 40 '' lcd sony xbr bravia 720 dpi an oppo upscaling dvd player and 5.1 sound system and for this movie i did n't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version so unless they 're selling this superbit version for 10 bucks or less which seems to be the trend since superbit discs may become moot now that hd dvd and discs are starting to come out i 'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers ||| 0

so disappointing hardly a film in my opinion just a proper hollywood murder mystery and there 's no sex except brief kissing which lana always cuts short ! i 'm a james m cain fan and this does n't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel everyone 's too decent cora lana does n't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body and she 's always costumed like a perfect fashion model fingernail polish and all frank garfield is never lustful never mean never desperate always polite and decent not a gas station except for one pump that looks planted not a single oil can or wrench not a greasy spoon or diner twin oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or b b fit for donna reed family the 80 's version is much better in all these areas and actually dark much more faithful to cain ||| 0
i am a big fan of faerietales and stories for children though i do not have any of my own on the whole i am unimpressed with the barbie series which is highly unoriginal with characters that seem as plastic as the dolls themselves while it manages to be more of a sedative than a painful experience it is not something that i would recommend to other lovers of faerietales faerie lore children however are often attracted to brightly colored things with simple stories and will most likely love it ||| 0
mission impossible the tv series told the adventures of the impossible missions force an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins foreign dictators terrorists and others who threatened the security of the united states rather than engage in james shoot outs the imf team worked together to covertly neutralize threats leaving little or no trace of their involvement although the imf had a leader steven hill as dan briggs and peter graves as jim phelps there was no star of the group just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective a truly groundbreaking show along comes brain de palma 's catastrophe of a remake starring that scientologist tom cruise within half an hour of the film starting the entire imf team save for cruise is killed off jim phelps jon voight is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original mission impossible is shot to hell granted ving rhames and jean reno are present as cruise 's new team but mission impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another tom cruise vehicle where he preens and postures making a film called mission impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original tv series it 's obscene what tom cruise 's ego has done to bruce geller 's original concept this is just another action film with cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself see the original tv series and skip this piece of bastardized trash ||| 0

the plot of hard target '' has been summarized in previous reviews so i 'll limit myself to discussing my favorite part hard target 's '' claim to fame when it came out was that it was john woo 's first american film and that 's certainly a big deal i just saw hard boiled '' the other day and i 'd need seven dictionaries to describe that glorious mess but it boggles my mind that lance henriksen 's death scene does n't land right at the top of every review of this movie i mean spoiler alert the dude has a grenade dropped into his pants he manages to get the grenade of his pants before it explodes and then he throws it away from him right wrong ! he unscrews the grenade hoping to separate the fuse from the explosive and he does separate them before the grenade goes off and starts laughing in triumph but he holds the fuse like two inches from the explosive and the spark jumps across ! funny enough already but makes this shocked whu '' sound that is more hysterical than the entire first season of the daily show right before blowing up it 's absolutely brilliant ||| 0
action director john woo 's first attempt at making a good american action movie fails with jean claude van damme bloodsport sudden death on board as the lead hero who jumps over police cars punches venomous snakes in the head hops on motorcyles balancing himself on it while he flips over a truck and lands on the ground kicking a gasoline tank at a guy while he shotgun blasts it and soving a grenade down the pants of evil bad ass lance henriksen near dark the terminator hey when isnt henriksen a evil son of a bitatch yancy butler drop zone is van dammes love interest protecting her from the villains trying to kill him and wilfrod brimley tv 's walker texas ranger plays van damme 's southern fried canjun uncle who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow while trotting off after his country house blows up all in all it doesnt become the worst movie ever made its only presence if the style john woo brings to his action scenes his lingo in the art of which he creates also starring arnold vosloo the mummy and the mummy returns as henriksen 's right hand man ah got ta love the scene where van damme has sexual chemistry with the snake while punching it ou ||| 0
i guess i hold the minorty here in thinking the north and south '' is just the worst civil war ever put on film they took great source material and turned it into days of our civil war lives '' a soap opera of the most unwanted kind i found myself hopeing that maybe it would get better but it got more unbelievible as it went on just a waste of a great cast and a lot of money ||| 0
given the cast i had high expectations for this movie but unfortunately it did n't deliver the storyline and plot twists are totally unbelievable even given the most disfunctional of families there are some nice perfomances granted and for this reason alone i gave it two stars but even with that grace it 's not enough to warrant giving it the 100 minutes of your life to watch ||| 0

a few comments about why i did n't like the video for my daughter the dvd is cheaply done the animation is almost all old and there are frequent times when the princess look like an animated statue with only their mouths moving while their prince next to them really does look like a statue since he does n't move at all the christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for halloween than christmas the part where belle almost drowns and would have certainly died of hypothermia is a good example of this though not the only example overall the video is not at all suited for young children ||| 0
horrible not funny i have no idea how people can say this is a good movie ok now i personally am a adam sandler fan but i just hated this movie accually i hated it so much i couldnt even finish it and we had to give it away i recomend you do not waist your time with this horrible excuse for a movie ||| 0
i actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years i tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes i was finally in the mood to watch it the other night let me say i am a big fan of ashley judd and i have loved every movie i have seen her in she did a great job as always just poor script writing it leaves a lot of questions unanswered such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms etc this fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point i may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something i missed ||| 0
this movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from russian captivity the film covers the experiences of a veteran german officer assigned as an advisor to a rumanian army corps on the eve of the stalingrad encirclement the film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of stalingrad one must think that it even disappointed it 's original german viewers of the 1950 's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of stalingrad and the nazi era as an film this film is a failure as a shoot 'em up action war film it is droll all in all this is less satisfying than a made for tv movie of the same period ||| 0
these 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in chinese cinema and definetly for jet li and movie kung fu however i watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which does n't have english subs i do n't mind but every other dvd i have ever seen has this also in the first ten minutes there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations for some reason cousin yi is now aunt 13 and chu 's bird is now chu 's beard this is crap do not buy this buy the movies seperately you can probably find them each for 9 bucks and they would be more satisfying that way ||| 0
a movie starring shelley long and bette midler as two women in love with the same guy when they learn that he 's used '' both of them they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from new york to new mexico silly and dumb with the usual chase fare thrown in everything is a cliche from the opposing personality idea long is an orderly midler a loudmouthed mess to desert hippies to car chases etc etc the movie seems to go on endlessly ||| 0

trash film usurps title people that like this film seem to come from a group that have only seen ersatz films such as the new mummy have nothing of real movie value to compare them to this must also be a group that has never seen a live play or an old german film the filmmakers attempted to capture a cross between nosferatu it may have worked in 1920 however the film is to clear and sharp it comes off looking more like a cross between a cartoon and a graphics ad the actors outweighed the characters and looked like they were reading the script i could swear that some were watching the teleprompter and who 's idea was it to cut up a three day old corps to get covered in blood that if was any had lone ago coagulated i could go on with quite a few examples but you get the idea this should be helpful even if you liked the movie if you are driving by a place that rents this dvd stay in the car ! ||| 0
why oh why do they keep placing redneck tim allen in christmas movies he ca n't act and he is disgusting i am ashamed at jamie lee curtis for reducing herself to this garbage i can understand tim allen thinking this was a good script the producer probably mailed the script to him as a coloring book with pictures but i had higher expectations from jamie lee curtis i have to say i usually love her but she was awful in this film she is reduced to whining and crying she does little else besides agreeing to everything her caveman husband tells her tim allen was awful from day one in his redneck middle america sitcom and to this day retains that disgusting overweight burping middle america character why do they keep putting him in christmas films it really does nauseate me to no ends to see him playing santa claus ||| 0
many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this too loved this movie at a certain period of my period between my birth and when i turned was when i read the book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever has now been awhile since i first read it but i still remember the excitement i felt with each new finished it in a few short then i have reread it several times and each time it has been just as is a true classic that people of all ages can brother reads as little as possible but even he loved movie on the other hand has gotten worse with each subsequent deters from the book in almost every way makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine dorothy the book dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and the film she is whiny cowardly fretful and slightly is also portrayed as being around her this old distorts the book and her older age does n't fit with her childish behaviour and wrecking the book this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible n't misunderstand me i am a fan of this film made for an atrocious every single song was annoying ! ! ! ! ! also the somewhere over the rainbow '' number did not suit the plotline as it was in the brings me to the biggest most awful distortion of them all ! ! ! in the book dorothy really went to oz ! ! ! ! ! not only that she returned to oz several times in other oz she even moved there to live ! ! ! in making the whole experience a dream the entire story of oz was said that this movie receives a 1 in my so i realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book then the dvd is the edition to features look good and the picture is for me i will spend my money on better things ||| 0

i never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd i was excited remembering the magazine from when i was a kid and being a fan of ilc snl and comedy itself i am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others do n't i write this review now as i am trying to watch the third disc i got the dvd the first day it came out and i have to watch every dvd i get even if i saw it before regardless to say i only broke a smurk once throughout the first 2 discs i even tried watching parts of the disc when i was having a great day and even when i was not in the greatest of moods i was in a good mood again this morning so i started watching it i think it is the lamest show that i have ever seen i really do n't know why it ever lasted past the first season if you 've seen the show on tv and you like it more power to you if you have n't seen it do n't buy it it is a waste of money everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny i personaly do n't think i should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny ||| 0

it starts out as a lady comes home to cook a boy for dinner but the boy tells the lady three storys from the tales from the darkside book the first one is lot 249 with christian slater julianne moore and steve buscemi which this one is the best with of course slater 's character then the next one is the cat from hell with william hickey and david johanssen this one is ok but it sometimes shallows the movie with its annoying and mangling old people the last one is a lover 's vow with james remar and rae dawn chong it starts off good with remar but then ends up being a cheesy story with its lame gargoyle effects ||| 0

i love bad movies so when i saw there was a documentary out all about ranking the worst movies i thought i 'd give it a try do n't bother with this dvd its 60 minutes long now think about that fact 50 movies in 60 minutes some movies are barely shown for twenty seconds or they use a commercial that reveals little of whats bad in the movie so problem number one they do n't show enough of the movies problem 2 is the bad designs of people booing and throwing popcorn at every movie they talk about the voice over was also a bit on the annoying side but thats probably the fault of the people who made this its actually very ironic that this being about the worst films is actually a terrible film in itself another complaint i have is on what merrits on they ranking these films for a few it seemed they put their not cause they were the worst movies made but because they were box office flops i 'm not saying ishtar or howard the duck were good movies but they should n't be placed on a list of the worst there are alot more terrible films with acting thats unbelievably bad mistakes galore poor lighting poor directing poor writing etc these were just bad movies that were flops i 'm surprised they did n't throw heaven 's gate in here if they were doing flops so i do n't get the criteria they were using a lot of really terrible movies were excluded too for some reason manos is sadly missing glen or glenda is alot worse then plan 9 despite plan 9 having the fame yet plan 9 got a lower ranking i guess the best thing i can say about this dvd is that they did get a list of some very bad movies robot monster and santa claus conquers the martians are amongst the worst movies you 'll ever see according to the dvd only black belt jones is a movie so bad its funny but many if not all picked are so bad they are funny i did n't like how they included the movie troll only because the sequel troll 2 was so much worse for heaven 's sake troll 2 did n't even have trolls in it it had goblins thats bad ! so if you guys want to watch a list of movies with barely any clips of the films that emphasize there baddness this a film for you those of you who do n't heres a breif list of some of their movies snow white and the 3 stooges greetings the frozen dead they saved hitler 's brain black belt jones tnt jackson the thing with two heads howard the duck billy the kid dracula bela legosi meets a brooklyn gorilla strange creatures bloodsucking freaks leonard pt 6 attack of the crab monsters robot monster santa claus conquers the martians troll trog xanadu the crippled masters i married a monster from outer space teenage zombie ghost and the invisible bikini fat spy plan 9 from outer space glen or glenda bride of the monster the mesa of lost women voodoo woman ishtar frankenstein conquers the world the creeping terror the great alligator hillbillys in a haunted house the incredible melting man firebird dracula frankenstein smokey and the bandits pt 3 the wild woman of wongo the ape galaxy of terror the robot the aztec mummy snow white german version creature from the haunted sea the swinging cheerleaders trial of billy jack killers from space spider baby the 3 stooges in orbit the sorceress the crawling hand jd 's revenge frankenstein meets the space monster killer shrews great white the thing with two heads eegah ! the incridebly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed up zombies certainly far from a definitive list of worst movie ||| 0
i found this film accidentially on amazon and was curious because i know welles did n't complete a great deal of films his directorial flourishes are definitely evident but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer the picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad it looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so i could n't tell whether this was a bad dvd presentation of a mediocre film or an awful movie put on dvd badly i did not shell out of the criterion edition which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film ||| 0
this is a potentially very good film interesting idea bearing some resemblance to angel heart '' sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer i do n't think i 've ever bought dvd or video or seen tv or cinema quite such an awful copy of a movie it is clearly stuck together from more than one original with the logo delta '' appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner but do n't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version the term special edition '' seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released ! ! ! ! ! tony curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue clearly from some late night cheap tv series do n't buy it maybe there 's a better version i read talk of a critereon '' disc maybe not still it really is n't worth any money ||| 0
i bought orson welles citizen kane and liked it so i decided to watch other welles movies i bought arkadin because the dvd is cheap and rated high on imdb i should have buyed touch of evil instead the quality of the picture is laughable sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes judging by the picture and sound quality i would say that they used equipment from the 30 's to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the european movie industry of the 50 's sometimes the picture shake during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we ca n't read everything the editing is very poor there are too many scene changes when i bought this dvd i expected to receive the laserlight version instead i got a dvd made by alpha video the case cover is different and there is no supplemental material he was mastered cheaply on a pc with the spruceup dvd maestro software that seem to create problems each time i try to play the disc on my computer the fbi warning message appear and then the disc eject i did n't notice any audio syncing problems however this movie is the perfect candidate for a remake i give for the story and for the overall quality of the movie ||| 0
the weight of water kathryn bigelow 2000 this movie should have been a big production an adaptation of an anita shreve novel directed by near dark 's kathryn bigelow starring a handful of actors so why does it seem like a lifetime original movie tm on steroids jean janes shadow of the vampire 's catherine mccormack is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the isles of shoals in 1873 when louis wagner rome 's ciaran hinds was convicted of the murders of two women and executed jean is n't sure they got the right person she and her poet husband thomas sean penn set off for the islands on a boat with thomas ' brother rich josh lucas recently of poseidon and rich 's new girlfriend adaline elizabeth hurley who went from this right on to film bedazzled the interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else and the situation on the boat brings jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime it 's an interesting premise and from everything i 've heard it 's carried off quite successfully in the book which i have n't read but oh it does n't work well at all in the film the links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way most of the actors are wasted here even the vastly talented mccormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self while sarah polley whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame seems as if she 's worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life about the only actor who 's really effective here is hinds who plays his role to the hilt it 's not the worst movie i 've seen in the past month but it 's pretty close ||| 0
i bought a copy of ntr for one reason and one reason only a single scene near the beginning prominently featuring rosanna arquette this was the same reason i bought a copy of the wrong man '' starring john lithgow and rosanna arquette discretion prevents my explaining further other than the scene already mentioned i found the movie pretty worthless ||| 0

added 5 whole minutes documentary about how to make a great movie suck by making it a broadway production deleted karaoke version of five songs from the soundtrack hold me now do you really want to hurt me every little thing she does is magic rappers delight white wedding worth the extra 13 i think not i suppose if you are one of the four people on the planet that does n't own this classic there is a option of which edition to purchase for the rest of us it 's just not worth it ||| 0
well nice cinematography as work nicely interiors and well dressed actors maybe visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year as other reviewers trying to assure ||| 0
i was so bored by this film that i thought i might be missing some subtle french cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting i asked a younger french female friend who said she found it at least as boring as i did the characters did n't engage my sympathy nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other so i did n't care what happened to them scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity did n't build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves the sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable i sat through to the end thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes i want my money back plus damages ||| 0
as i remember when i watched the original chinese version although it wasnt any big deal but i did like it as i remember but this version is totally destroy that feeling something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap especially some sound effect why do n't they put the original track in it i hard can understand if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me it worth my 3 stars with the original trac ||| 0
it did n't take me long to forget this film once again it stars jet in a strange role ||| 0

the bad i ca n't say i dislike this item but i did not like it either even though i 'm still a novice golfer score between and been playing for about 18 months i 've read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other dvds yes i 'm an instruction junky and i can say that this instrutor simon holmes misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing and even though i like how the dvd has a well structured lesson category listing he does not explain deeply enough on many things the filming production seems to have a good intention for this dvd but it lacks camera on the ball clubhead ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want 's to explain i mean with today 's technology on dvd production this seems to be a cheap one the good he has very good tips on many subjects that i think they 're transparent for a very beginner if this is not your first instructional dvd and just want to gather a new bunch of tips then buy it otherwise a better selection that i can reccomend for a complete golf school dvd is the wally armstrong 's ultimate golfing experience the set is very cheap because it 's a compilation of old and from that instructor and from the 5 dvd 's in the box you can thrash 2 if you like but for 17 bucks hey ! ! is worth it ! i hope this helps and saves you some money ||| 0
unlike many i had n't seen this film when it first came out so it was with much anticipation that i recently sat down to watch it well it stunk what a disappointment the only really good thing in there is leo mckern who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue show 'em how it 's done leo michelle pfeiffer is beautiful to look at but her role is limited matthew broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever which hampers the film since his character is supposed to be a thief fortunately he has come a long way as an actor since then rutger hauer is just plain bad in defense of the director and crew the film is prettily shot with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene in well lit scenic locations otherwise i would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations ||| 0
vol 3 marks a new low for family guy a season that started out strong but ended very oh my god i was so shocked by that hahahahaha '' it seems to be riding on it 's laurels so to speak and it 's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny i do n't like it and i think it 's been reduced to recent simpson quality meanwhile the dvd has a few commentaries i 'd like to point out that the competition simpson dvd 's have commentaries on every episode same with futurama some special features the biggest problem here is that the first two discs are which means four episodes per disc as opposed to the traditional seven we only get thirteen episodes of crap and maybe we should be grateful but all in all whatever raoul duke ||| 0
i 'll get this out of the way i never liked the 80 's slasher films stuff like the halloween series nightmare on elm street or friday the just never entertained me all that much the idea of slow walking killers going after olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me of course the major draw was the death scenes elaborate moments of viciousness flinging jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it 's a good kind of laughing for some reason jason is in the future in a facility on a planet except he escapes of course disposing of scientists including the fly and scanners director david cronenberg he ends up getting cryogenically frozen along with another scientist flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out ooh a nice reward for jason as usual he comes to life and does what he does best kill attractive looking hotties you do n't go to these movies to expect dialogue character depth or anything you come for the kills and to tell you the truth they 're slightly disappointing besides one kill which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface the kills are kind of been that it 's basically stab here impale there it seems kind of unimaginative a few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance characters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are however jason does what i 'm starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls one girl wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off off screen and i 'm like damn guy let one cute girl live for once ! '' dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines a parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced we love premarital sex ! '' is so classic as well as it 's okay he just wanted his machete back ! '' granted they wo n't make an afi list but they made me laugh it 's the kind of movie that you probably were n't supposed to like it was ridiculous and dumb but boy did it seem fun just wish it was better ||| 0
jennifer love hewitt needs to fire her manager i 've yet to see her in a truly good role those terrible know what you did last summer movies garfield heartbreakers if only and many others were n't exactly memorable roles the truth about love does n't help bump her in that direction either not that i was expecting when i looked at the back of the box seeing a picture of her in a leather corset i was n't going off of words to know that i was slightly interested in the movie i 've owned it for a few months now and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and i were in the other room playing games she kept coming out every 5 minutes and i could tell that she was n't that interested after giving in and watching it with her i now wish we had all played resident evil 4 instead after what has to be one of the most annoying sweet '' introductions we learn that a man has mailed a valentine letter to his friend 's wife alice supposedly by accident yeah real smooth when alice gets it she assumes it 's from her husband sam and sends him a hot letter as well he gets it thinking it 's from another woman and the problems ensue he starts to hide the letter from her and with that in mind she tests his loyalty to her she texts his phone anonymously with some of the dirtiest things hewitt 's done in recent memory but as it turns out sam does have a mistress and things get more complicated you know what the entire movie 's boring up until through you 're better off just reading the back of the box for the plot summary then skipping to scene 9 or 10. and that 's one of the cons i had with the truth about the time it takes to build up to what 's an actually good conclusion with sam 's anonymous admirer does n't seem like it 's worth it at first but i 'll admit alice 's plan to bust sam was a good one though she gets a harsh slap of reality once everything 's over the key problem with the movie is probably that it takes place in england and jennifer love hewitt 's forced to take on one of the worst accents i 've ever heard there were a few times when i thought that they hired a voice actor to dub over her it does n't sound like her and mouth movements often do n't match lines and that 's funny considering the majority of the cast is from the uk then comes the unbelievable part about a guy cheating on a woman of jennifer love hewitt 's stature there 's no way in hell that could ever happen unless the guy is mentally challenged carson daly the kicker is that sam 's mistress is a woman who looks to be in her and pales to hewitt in any physical category and how about that archie guy he 's in 3 important scenes at most all the other times we see him involve he and sam 's court room scenes which i have to say are some of the most boring attempts at forced humor in fact the trial does n't even have a connection to the central plot aside from showing that sam and archie are friends and partners alice 's friend is also a complete hussy and seems like she did n't make the cut of being on sex and the city finally guys i 'm sorry to tell you this but there are no scenes of nudity here aside from when alice visits an adult movie store though the best we get from hewitt is her in a corset it 's only for a few collective seconds the love scene is kind of laughable too when she 's wearing that ridiculous wig even right now i still have mixed feelings about the movie just when something completely stupid happens something decent does right after it this is some of the worst picture quality i 've seen in a while the transfer looks terrible even watching it on my hd monitor there were tons of errors grain artifacts and something new i almost want to call it many scenes are out of alignment and we get a watery effect that takes over the entire picture i ca n't explain it in full detail but more or less people 's faces and bodies would look all twisted every couple of seconds it stays for most of the first fifth of the movie then is only occasional after that but then there 's blocking and many more problems that make up for it you 'd think with a direct to dvd release they could at least get something right the audio fares a little better but everything 's weird once again while you can hear the audio just fine it 's almost too loud at times and incredibly all the actors ' lines look like they 're especially jennifer 's this becomes very obvious halfway through the movie when archie yells at sam the camera is behind archie so we can see the back of his head talking to sam but when he yells his mouth does n't open special features none though the box tries to claim that a chapter selection previews spanish subtitles close captioning and dolby 5.1 are special features we all know better than to fall for that at the very least i expected some behind the scenes interviews or something with everyone going on about how great it was to work on a movie bound for failure is there any reason to buy the truth about love not at all i guess that phrase low expectations lead to better results '' does ring true for it i just wish the director writers and actors had put a little more effort into everything but you know the funny thing i 'll bet twenty bucks that this thing gets remade in a year or two with actors sorry jennifer and finds success after they rewrite all the boring parts even as a date movie there are many better ones out there might i suggest shaun of the dead ||| 0
when buying a product you expect a little bang for your buck unlike its counterpart family classics action classics leaves far short of its mark although these movies are old you expect quality unfortunately the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy you 'd think that because they 're on dvd the quality would be better the movies shown are low budget b movies with unknown actors and limited action need i continue inaction in this case would be best served save your money for better things like a hot fudge sundae ! ! ! ||| 0

heavyweights was a quite a disappointment considering the presence of ben stiller the movie sheds light on a popular summer camp for fat children that unexpectedly finds itself under different management the new administration will make it clear very soon that some major changes are to take place the plot and the acting are surprisingly ! average while the humor and the dialogues are below average ben stiller 's character a cross between zoolander and dodgeball both being amazing movies was unexpectedly plain and bland as for the rest of the cast this film does not seem to be their thing though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off a shame really no masterpiece here ||| 0
the script and dialogue are lousy all this film has to recommend it is a pretty face and occasional scenes depicting flesh the lady is not very interesting to say the least nothing original this is a clone of a thousand other french movies about young women trying sex for the first time avoid ||| 0
i do not like the format of the dvd at all i had taken several pilates classes before buying this dvd but i found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end much of pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times so with no reminder of what i should be doing in each pose i felt like i was being cheated out of a workout i do n't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form so this dvd will be stored away while i learn the specifics of pilates elsewhere ||| 0
a friend and i tried watching this film once again recently but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant from the beginning when katharine hepburn 's character destroys other people 's cars without a care we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny the acting is fine as could be expected from such greats as hepburn and cary grant but the characters are not sympathetic fun or interesting grant 's character is an unassertive spineless person who is easily dominated hepburn 's character is blindly selfish who could care what happens to them the one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard ||| 0
let me start off by saying that i am a huge madtv fan and have been for years it is easily my favorite show of all time while i loved the complete season 1 '' released in 2004 i think this dvd set is terrible why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent and arguably the worst seasons makes no sense to me of course this does have some classic sketches impressions and characters on it such as debra wilson 's oprah and mo collins ' lorraine but a majority of it is just random most of these sketches are n't some of the better ones who picked this list of course i 'll still buy it because i love madtv but hopefully in time they 'll go back to releasing complete seasons again i can watch a better mix of sketches and episodes for free every day on comedy central ||| 0
i really enjoyed season 1 but from the look of this we 're never going to see other complete seasons released why release the best of seasons 8 9 10 when you 've never released the complete seasons what about complete seasons etc cabana chat with rodney dangerfield phil lamarr 's impressions of michael jackson prince little hassan taylor 's greatest hits darlene mcbride vancome halloween the wash me '' video parody of alanis morissette lick my baby back behind '' video parody of britney spears the love muffin '' video parody of mariah carey the bush cheney rap video parody the ubs man goes to the video rental shop afropuffs cereal the early madtv was a little savage at times but that 's what made it funny i feel it 's appropriate to issue the best after you 've put out the complete seasons of course maybe there were legal problems some of the humor was pretty savage ! i guess if you can find it in syndication then make your own ||| 0

this is a movie directed and played by a guy with unsalvageable narcissus complex always dreamed himself as a modern day casanova in just like that george kastansa character in 'seifield ' a big lover a womanizer a baldy forever young romeo almost all of the screenplays he wrote the movies he directed the characters he played were all like this i just do n't know how women would fall for him in the least sense and possibility only if in his wet dreams this is a very nauseating movie all of his movies are almost the same only the movie titles changed the only one i liked is his recent 'match point ' nothing else and i felt lucky this guy was too old to play that role now otherwise he would n't allow anyone else to play that ambitious murderer but him ||| 0
i expected so much more because it 's marshall but regardless of where you purchase this it 's edited it 's pathetic this is eminem ! i understand you have a daughter mathers but do not make all of us watch an edited concert this is probably the most ridiculous thing i 've ever bought there 's not even a warning that it 's censored you just buy it pop it in your dvd player and listen to a concert with mostly every other word jarbled up it 's a useless dvd there 's no point in buying it first encore now this i 've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90 's as somebody from michigan i saw him before he was cartier global super star buying skin treatments at barneys i 've never been more disappointed with an artist ||| 0
i went and saw another film as i was so disenchanted with this one the opening had so little to do with the rest of the film i thought i was watching a preview to another film i do n't care for spoofs about catholics and protestants the pythons ca n't sing or dance for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable i say to the fans of python get a life ||| 0
unfortunately they just do not get off the ground python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge regrettably they missed the mark on this one one or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it however if you like sex violence blood and debauchery could care less the fact that they have nothing to do with the absent plot you could find this film interesting ||| 0
not my type of humor i think i 'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining ||| 0
i 'm sorry folks but i went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen it would be a tremendous understatement to say i was disappointed this film is horrible in nearly every respect but this is the film 's fatal flaw a character study '' is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature the film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice sorry to bring up the obvious here but the only thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping he would not be with helping defend the police station he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun he would not be worried about his chances out there '' remember he 's on death row he would be concerned only with escaping immediately sorry to all you fans of this cult classic '' but a movie in this vein must be at least somewhat realistic to gain my praise this one is a mess ||| 0

the gauntlet may rank as one of clint eastwood 's worst movies it is so unrealistic and silly i frankly did n't want to even finish it released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and dirty harry movies it stands out as being a real stinker here eastwood plays a loser of a cop ben shockley who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in las vegas for a trial he 's told it 's a nothing witness for a nothing case '' so he thinks it 'll be an easy assignment well poor shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness it seems some conspiracy is afoot the rest of the movie is shockley and his female witness gus mally running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes and plot is so ludicrously predictable it 's pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is unless you really really like clint eastwood this is one to forget i 'll bet he wishes he could ||| 0
what a rip off ! this is my very first bad experience with amazon heck this is the first time i have n't been extremely satisfied who in the world would purposely order a psp disc of any movie the heading for this item still incorrectly states that it is a two 2 disc set it does not mention that it is in some stange format no one in their right mind would buy you can imagine my surprise when i opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device do n't order this ||| 0
i had to contact amazon five times about this item i ordered it on and it did n't ship for several weeks then when i check my account the description had changed to umd for psp you will not get the dvd if you order this i eventually cancelled mine amazon is using the wrong cover art and the wrong disc specs for this title and does n't seem too worried about correcting this do not order ||| 0
i am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one this is not the dvd version of the film however on all the links to it it says dvd '' when i received the item in the mail amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return and even told me that they would send the dvd version of the film nonetheless two days later i received the same psp version again great movie it 's in my top ten amazon screwed up on this one ||| 0
i was thrilled when i saw there was a new sesame street christmas dvd out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized and as much as i enjoy being a sesame street kid 37 just like the show i was tiring of the same stuff over and over imagine my surprise then when virtually all of this dvd is just the highlights of the others classic ernie bert and the beloved hooper from hanukkah from and bob singing all though the year '' from saves christmas '' among others the only new part is christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage if you do n't have the other three dvds this would probably earn 4 stars if you do have the other dvds this is not a necessity hopefully next time the budget will allow sesame workshop to be more creative ||| 0
i ca n't imagine why madonna janet jackson or michael jackson 's vma performances were not included in this dvd the most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded i do n't understand it is a travesty i hope mtv releases more of the vma performances with madonna janet and michael i 'll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of vma performances ||| 0
i have to say this show did not turn me on at all i like twisted humor and a good puppet show this however did n't do much of anything in fact it aimed at the gutter and worked it 's way down very disappointing and also very looks like something filmed for tv i 'm guessing canadian tv some people might find it funny i understand some people find beavis butthead funny i don't ||| 0

i just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a hollywood film the departed i can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie after watching this movie i turned to my wife and said this movie would have been great if it would have stared with an ounce of talent ! '' the acting is very affected and understand that 's how hong kong always act its a sort of us 1930 's throwback style i really really despise us film remakes but martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline i would suggest watching the us version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises not to mention this movie is avoidable without the intrigue ps i have not yet seen the departed but i am assuming that it is a much better version than this however come on america we have plenty of creative writers out there ca n't we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots ||| 0
i love tng and i even quite like a few of the characters in enterprise but i hate voyager why one simple reason janeway i cant stand her she makes me want to puke she has only two personas in the entire series and she constantly alternates between them and they are both nauseating first in which she puts on this phony 'caring ' face and talks in a 'caring ' gentle whisper two in which she puts on a scowl and speaks in a deeper voice that is not in the slightest bit believable god she nauseates me the same thing happened with maggie thatcher the one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything unlike kirk picard sisko and even archer janeway has no charisma at all yuck but shes not the only one this has got to be the only star trek series in which no matter how hard i tried i could never develop any attachment to the characters they 're all boring only paris has any appeal and even then not much i watched the first 3 seasons hoping i would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up years later i finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years no the same old nauseating janeway same old boring episodes spewing over with and endless lectures about human 'morality ' and this series is the most mushy sentimental crap of all the star trek series there is barely an episode that is not in its emotional mushyness the only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the ' episode and that was only because q was in it and they even turned that into a morality play and the very end of 'renaissance man ' when the doctor tells harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded targ good riddance voyager and especially good riddance janeway ||| 0
the book of acts is a book of power ! sadly this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak acting rendition of the story thankfully it is word for word from the bible which is why i gave it two stars reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers all of that is lost in the dvd presentation i would not recommend this dvd stick to the book instead ||| 0
the only other ff material i 've see is the movie and i did n't play any of the games yet so i 'm not basing this review on that after watching the first 3 dvdsand about through the show i can say for me this show sucked the animation was bland and ugly looking the animation which was produced by gonzo was poor and did n't blend in at all if you want good works by gonzo check out full metal panic vandread hellsing gatekeepers and a few others the plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world there they meet a strange man strong silent type each episode goes something like this the kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place the bad guy kid sends his minions to where they 3 are the man in black shows up approx 7 min left in ep and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun attached to arm turns on and he says it has moved '' yells soil is my power '' cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy then he goes away the kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over that happens every single episode and there is very little plot development come on at least pokemon has more of a plot this show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what i understand is not a big final fantasy '' demographic strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it ||| 0
if you 're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill this is not '' the video for you however if you want a training video on big wave surfing go ahead a better video for the stoke would be the classic endless summer 2. much more of a better buy billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in odyssey about surfing training on watercrafts and then they get to the surfing i fell asleep throughout the of it i had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing nice documentary for discovery channel not for the wired surf enthusiast so ||| 0

this is your typical film which replaces reality with fantasy something liberals like to impose on others it flopped because it just does n't have the ring of reality to it you can have beautiful scenery some decent actors except the twit with his ice cube scowl and then a really stupid storyline whallah you get the fantasy liberal worldview in the movie the evil guys are an leader and his band of toughs the good guys are '' with their leader being a conman who found his destiny lol ! dumb just plain dumb ! you realize it is the no i 'm not pro either for the record are worse getting others to do their fighting cowards they are who put limits on free speech have eroded things so bad that i 'm afraid a general bethlehem type guy minus the lunatic traits obviously is the only way to fix things look to ancient rome for the answers on this matter to be brief the bad '' guys are liberals and and the good guys are yet to make themselves known this movie is right only in that america will split up and probably fall in some capacity history shows the way which our current masquerading as humans will not understand nor can do anything about it too busy playing video games and im each other one lesson to be learned in the movie is this might makes right here 's another all is fair in love and war ||| 0
royal wedding is n't on dvd yet that 's because the owner of the film warner has n't released it yet but several other companies have under the guise '' of public domain the original copyright on the film was not renewed properly with the library of congress so the film is perceived to be public domain although the music is very much copyrighted and every distributor of this movie is participating in copyright infringement by selling these bootlegs '' the companies make the money because they 're selling other people 's property the people who ultimately suffer are you the consumer unknowingly buying products of inferior worse than professional vhs quality thinking you 're getting the real thing because it 's a dvd save your money wait until warner gives us the real thing thing and by the way the movie gets 4 stars it 's the cheapo bootleg dvd that gets 1 star ! ||| 0
every store should have a dvd shredder for movies that suck rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away adding darryl hannah and denise richards to an already horrible story line just to sell dvds is a disgrace trying to do 80 's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one save your time money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video ||| 0

our family has an embarassingly large collection of elmo and sesame street dvds so i speak from experience i found this production to be way below par my 2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do instead the plot if poorly contrived the production value is low the acting for the most part is awful and it 's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age my son has no interest in he did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer but i 'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip better bets a celebration of me grover or sesame street the street we live on ||| 0
i just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter i was disappointed with the 4 dollars i spent on it for that it is more like a music video than a story the segments are of adults no children singing or playing and the story line is n't much sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there was n't anything educational about this video and i am so glad i did n't buy it i really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now i 'm sorry that we did even that stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy i hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were ||| 0

did anyone else watch the same movie that i did or should i say try to watch the same movie that i did i am a huge classic movie lover and had heard good things about this one i was mislead i can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie in fact i am sure that carpenter and o'bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past the unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring the 'effects ' do n't exist and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing it 's not funny it is embarassing i could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage ||| 0
yes ! i agree with the other reviewers ! this is the one vandamm movie i love and when i found it in my one used shop i was so extatic i never looked to see screen format ! i never though that it would be full screen ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ye gods ! it totally ruins that wonderful sceen in the kitchen of him doing the splits ! hey ya i 'm a female and i can go ouch at that scene too ! that stunt hurts to do and man very nice ! the cropping really really ruins the impressive impact of that scene and i 've not see the picture since it first came out it was really a disappointment when i saw full screen come on universal ! ! ! we want wide screen ! full picture ! ! ! ! this is a fantastic action picture and a crying shame to see it in full screen only ! ! ! ! ! ||| 0
how sad and pathetic this concert loved the dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their seeing how good the stooges reunion concert was i was hoping for more of the same wrong ! ! it becomes painfully clear from the start that johanssen in particular is phoning it point of the show is when they make human being '' one of the greatest songs ever a me a break ! ! ! ! ||| 0
this is one bad movies i am a devout horror fan but i was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie the acting is worse than bad it 's a joke the plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous save your money even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive there is no humor no likable characters not even a decent quote or one liner by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back so save yourself disappointment and keep looking this movie is the biggest bomb i have stumnbled across in years ||| 0
i have to say i had no expectations going into this movie i watched it with an open mind ready for anything what i got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to wales but also made me want to wail for hours because it was a waste of time i am just confused about the whole thing really the plot the characters the ending see other reviews on here about how creepy '' it was and i just did n't feel that what i felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by maria bello who i have never thought had a face or talent for acting what they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane where the dead go and we can get the dead back if we give something living the daughter is whisked away like penelope taken to hades but with much less interesting results the mother and father now have to take care of a displaced spirit child her haunted freaky father and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice ikea blanket for me are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously and gullible local folks who worships in an abattoir c'mon people none of these folds deserved children much less a ghost one so when the mother realizes that she sucks and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care i did n't really care i was thinking the girl was much better off i was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father because her daughter asked her too um maybe what 's wrong in this family is that no one communicates ! ! ! ! ! oh wait they all flipping know morse code so that 's enough ! ! there are n't any genuine scares and sheep with glowing eyes are n't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it the ending both of them did n't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together it felt rushed i do n't understand hollywood 's obsession right now with creepy children it 's an echo of the days of the bad seed '' and the omen '' but not homage more like terrible copycats with no oomph '' so see this movie if you like sean bean he is the only good thing about it other than that see it to cheer when maria bello hurls herself off a cliff ||| 0
1 scarlett o'hara is the least likable heroine '' i 've ever seen she has no redeeming qualities 2 we 're supposed to sympathize with the south and feel nostalgia for the good old days when white folks could own black folks 3 this movie is way too long and dull 4 i 'm glad they burned atlanta to the ground 5 there was nothing honorable or respectable about the old south and the plantation way of the life the gentlemen '' were nothing but racists who thought they were aristocrats because blacks did all their work for them 6 i 'd rather watch mandingo '' than this racist garbage any day of the week ||| 0
ignore the blurb on the vhs box the movie is not about a couple 's hot parties with hip friends it is about a couple 's awful parties with jerk friends now that might not be a bad thing in fact i think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones but the advertising is dishonest much worse though is the the pointless and boring character of the movie which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic friends '' who mostly do n't like each other while i 've known cliques that keep getting together despite frictions between some members it 's inconceivable that these people would keep getting together for these abusive and tedious holiday events also the couples ' relationships which come and go between these parties are unexplained and mostly unexplored as are some individuals ' character changes and indeed almost everything that does n't happen at the parties themselves ||| 0
this should have been better but angela bassett 's performance was the best so i guess it 's worth a watch ||| 0
others have already described the movie so i shall not repeat what has already said dumont makes a movie somewhat reminiscent of the late early road '' movies in which a couple gets in a car and drives off to nowhere in particular i hated those movies but at least in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen and seem only to be there to move the plot if there is one along katia the girl who seems quite psycotic if you ask me keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever for instance she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car then gets p sed at her boyfriend when he hits one of them by the time the movie approaches its dismal end i did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up the dvd includes a director 's note of intent '' always a bad sign a mix of felliniesque dialog blended with sun tzu not a good combination at the end of the note of intent '' the director finishes with envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct '' well instinct will not get you a viewable movie i do n't think you could make a worse movie if you were trying to achieve it it is not the violence or sex other movies have that but still have some redeeming values photography artistic creation there is no redeeming value in this just a waste of the dvd plastic ||| 0
i purchased this video to get ideas for a yoga fusion class that i 'm designing boy was i dissapointed ! this film is for spectators and posers not for serious yogis you can barely hear shiva 's cues over the music the video is so focused on being 'cool ' that it totally fails to instruct cue or demonstrate poses anyone who has never done yoga would be totally lost and as for the trance dance was not entranced the problem was that shiva was very tight and i did n't get a sense of freedom from her there was one guy that seemed to be 'in the moment ' but for the most part the trance dance was quite silly not a good instructional video all glitz no substance ||| 0
unfortunately i was sent a standard american copy of the movie which of course does n't function on a european system despite my adress beeing in switzerland so i was kind of disapointed to have a lost the money b not been able to watch the movie one is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible dvd player ||| 0
i like pauley shore i have seen him in other movies that i liked so i made the mistake of buying the jury duty video because i liked in the army now and and assumed i would like this too well i learned my lesson well and i learned it the hard way and wasted my money and i have learned to never assume i will like a movie because i liked the actor in another movie and from now on i will rent the movie first ! jury duty simply was just plain awful with it 's weak boring plot and unfunny humor ! in the army now and were a lot funnier and if you want to kick back relax and laugh your backside off than watch those movies ||| 0
hey genius good job ruining the end of the movie for anyone who has n't seen it like say my five year old and eight year old children it 's a miracle if i can even get them to sit still for five minutes and now that they know the ending to this film there 's no way they 're ever going to agree to go to bed tonight thanks a bunch ever heard of the internet before you must be a first time user ||| 0
here we go again another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots the differences between season 3 and this drivel are staggering they must have swapped out writers or something how else do you explain the camera lingering on lana lang 's many revealing showers for no reason let me say this as clearly as i can showing skin on smallville does n't work ! ! good points michael rosenbaum is still the best lex luthor ever put on film sarah carter as alicia baker is back ! she 's clark kent 's interim girlfriend like a psycho lori lemaris who cares if she tried to slice n ' dice lana last season and it makes no sense for clark to be within 50 miles of her i do n't there are two new supporting characters this time lois and erm jason i weep for jensen ackles he 's way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role the way he takes a character like lana 's new boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something erica durance as lois easily the worst actress and her lines do n't help i do n't really mind because erica looks like lois even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese annoyance i think lois would work better if she just stayed in metropolis and we saw her only through chloe but i guess it 's cheaper to keep her on the regular set personally i think it 's a conspiracy to give allison mack less screen time why does n't she get a revealing shower bah that make my brain hurt 1 clark somehow becomes a quarterback for the football team you get to see it for five episodes what drama ok this is just stupid he 's cheating ok it 's cheating he ca n't just switch off his powers when he wants to clark 's football career also results in the episode recruit '' which is hazardous to your health 2 turns out lana 's i thought she was native american nah just french and a villain 3 producer hey does n't this show remind you of charmed writer not really but great idea ! ! lets dress lois lana and chloe is corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers ! '' 4 if the writers were n't going to keep jason around for more than one season why put him in the credits durr 5 jane seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in tv history she does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck bye 6 'jynx ' 'spell ' 'recruit ' 'sacred ' 'spirit ' and 'ageless ' oh right and 'forever ' all lame ! they make me ashamed to watch the show ! some are so awful i do n't think i 've ever watched them more than once that 's like half the dvd set bah oooohh i wonder if clark and lana are gon na get together this season ! just they like get together and break up every season ! i 'm on pins and needles ! the only things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes oh yeah hey writers stop ripping off other successful shows and movies ! morons ||| 0
first off let me explain why i purchased the around the world in 80 days dvd in the first place sight unseen one i was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950 's as i could on dvd to add to my personal library two it was the winner of the 1956 best picture oscar how bad could it be right and third it was on sale at my local wholesaler so i figured what the hey i 'll take a chance talk about a colossal disappointment i 'm a huge movie buff i 'm only 32 years old but i love all sorts of films and genres from different periods and countries i love old black white and silent films and i do n't shy away from foreign films either i 'm also a huge fan of warner brothers ' special edition dvds i try to keep an open mind about all the films i see but i just ca n't come up with any convincing arguments to either buy or watch this to start there is no good reason why this film should be 3 hours long it could have very easily been edited down to 2 if not 90 minutes there is almost no script to speak of and what little there is consists of trite exchanges and banter with barely 2 memorable lines of dialogue there are endless shots of open seas or country followed by about 30 seconds of dialogue followed by even more endless footage of different locales there is no real drama or comedy going on to drive the film and the pacing is absolutely dreadful i found myself hitting the '' button on my remote on more than a few occasions simply because i knew i was n't missing any dialogue and the establishing shots would go on for 1 or 2 minutes straight ! secondly the entire cast is virtually wasted david niven is always a delight to watch but is never given a chance to make fogg truly shine he has one demeanor that he holds throughout stiff and mannered with little or no variation cantinflas who supposedly was one of the highest paid comedians in the world at the time 80 days was produced gives us little reason to believe how or why he was such a sensation other than doing his own stunt work he 's mildly amusing at best and his accent is so thick and mumbled that i had to rewind and replay some scenes with the subtitle '' button on as for the noted '' cameos again the are given little to do and barely play to their strengths and familiarity the only cameo actor who stuck out as having any real performance or impact was the great john carradine ca n't miss that voice ! it 's hard to believe it took three different writers to come up with such a frustratingly bland lifeless and unfunny script not to mention headscratchingly illogical when cantinflas rescues the shirley maclaine princess character would n't she fall in love with him her actual rescuer rather than the cool and distant fogg who only ordered the rescue talk about a missed opportunity for some genuine comedy ! although this film obviously has some fans i wonder if it 's only because of some overriding nostalgia factor whether it was seeing it for the first time back in 1956 or on tv as a child other than that i ca n't understand how anyone could seriously recommend this film yes it 's beautifully photographed and the costumes are great but that 's it i ca n't believe that 80 days won the best picture oscar of 1956 a year that also gave us giant the ten commandments the king and i the searchers hell even forbidden planet or invasion of the body snatchers should have won before this overblown moving postcard i 'm sorry to say that i probably wo n't bother watching this film again and will most likely end up reselling my dvd copy if anyone will take it ! certainly my most disappointing dvd purchase ever do n't say you were n't warned ! ||| 0
this final season is just ridiculous and not in a good way when the wayans abandon a project then you know it is unfunny and over just look at the scary movie films kelly coffield left because the producers wanted to use alexandra wentworth more a huge mistake ! kelly was hilarious save your money and avoid this stinker season ||| 0
when shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang but saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks now dont get me wrong it was funny i 'll give it that that 's the only reason it got 2 stars but season raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure in living color wise so i 'd recomend this for the series collectors like me meaning i have season and although i didnt like season 5 i 'd feel uncomplete without it ||| 0
this is a wonderful film some may say it 's a bit slow paced and perhaps it 's not geared for the mtv generation 's pace of visual stimulation nonetheless patience has it 's rewards for anyone who cares to take a chance it appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the director tati unfortunately the video transfer on this edition is so terribly soft as though the telecine was not in focus it 's a crime that such a great film could not have been treated with greater care one only hopes that a dvd transfer of superior quality is in the pipes ||| 0
the book of acts is a book of power ! sadly this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak acting rendition of the story thankfully it is word for word from the bible which is why i gave it two stars reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers all of that is lost in the dvd presentation i would not recommend this dvd stick to the book instead ||| 0
i did watch that and i did not liked cause i know good detailed information about this history this dvd is making polishing boeing company instead lockheed won this techonology war ! it is 2 hours long and boeing appears most of the times there is no good explanation how lockheed is performed that outstanding job it all talkes about boeing and at the final it again declares boeing bla bla good bla bla succesfull at stealth jobs i think the director was from boeing compan ||| 0
i do n't know what to say about this it was interesting but not wowing by any standards it was to watch with interesting graphics and the concept is novel too but the music sucks and thats half the dvd right there recommend renting or borrowing from a friend i would n't buy this dvd again ||| 0
ok i 'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn this film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon it really does n't take a genius to figure out this plot i mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room i turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film 's plot and sure enough i was right on the money only i thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no it had to keep going and going just end allready i get it ! ||| 0
i am a big fan of martial arts films having lived in taiwan however this one was in my opinion the love affairs in the dvd were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times i often enjoy the melodrama and of chinese films but i gagged a few times on this one it was goofy at times i really wanted this one to grab me but it did not ||| 0
while it may be true that the camera does n't lie '' when you take hours of footage and edit them down to 6 you have a lot of leaway to manipulate immediately after finishing the film i would have given this movie 4 stars it 's very well crafted and kept my wife and me fascinated for all eight episodes after we finished watching it however we wanted to know more so we started gathering information from other sources very quickly we discovered that we had been conned de lestrade clearly knew what would make a compelling story and he crafted the footage to tell that story unfortunately it does n't appear to be the real story we felt so betrayed we 'd spent 6 hours watching what was purported to be the truth only to discover that huge amounts of evidence had not been shown much less explained and that the documentary clearly was more spin that revelation if you want to see a film that will keep you amazed and guessing definitely see this film if you want to see something that reflects reality i would look elsewhere ||| 0
controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating but this film showed two desperate strangers with all their flaws abundantly clear meeting once a week for encounters the fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the desperate '' tawdry pathetic feel of their relationship naturally one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters sooner or later anonymity is not good enough anymore ||| 0
