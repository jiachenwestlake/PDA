i purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad it will run my cable modem router pc and lcd monitor for 5 minutes this is more than enough time to save work and shut down equally important i know that my electronics are receiving clean power i feel that this investment is minor compared to the loss of valuable data or the failure of equipment due to a power spike or an irregular power supply as always amazon had it to me in 2 business days ||| 1
i ordered 3 apc es on the recommendation of an employee of mine who used to work at apc i 've had them for about a month now without any problems they 've functioned properly through a few unexpected power interruptions i 'll gladly order more if the need arises pros large plug spacing good for power adapters simple design long cord cons no line conditioning usually an expensive option ||| 1
wish the unit had a separate light when power to the unit is missing the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds the warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it is n't always easy to tell what is happening ||| 1
cheaper than thick cd cases and less prone to breakage these slim '' cases by memorex protect your cds most buyers will get them for use in cd or dvd burning and these are an affordable choice from a quality company for that purpose you may want to consider larger cases depending on your tastes but otherwise these will probably satisfy your needs ||| 1

this product was perfect it 's a sturdy case that holds my large collection of cd 's and dvd 's my other cases were flimsy and wore out fast this one has a hard outside shell and the inside holds my dvd 's nicely so i have no complaints and at the price i paid i 'd say this was a great deal ||| 1

after going through the reviews i bought this cf card for my canon digital rebel so far it has worked fine though i do n't pretend to be an expert digital photographer when the card is empty it shows 127 shots available it seems to read reasonably fast though it takes a bit longer than i was used to with my olympus and its smartmedia card ||| 1
i am very happy with this product it folds super slim so traveling with it is a breeze ! pretty good sound not bose quality but for the price very respectable ! i 've had it almost a year and it has been along on many weekend and works great i use it alot so it was a good purchase for me ||| 1
i bought this reader because i wanted to avoid having my camera and all its cable attached to my pc to download the pictures and with this reader i could leave my camera and its cables in its case and just download the picture with the memory card i recomend this product ||| 1
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue ||| 1
i was thinking about buying a card but after reading one of the reviews i bought two 512 card just in case that something went wrong which to me made a lot of sense i 'm please ||| 1
i have always been very pleased with the sandisk products i would highly recommend them ||| 1
these earphones are great quality the sound is good and they fit comfortably in the ear once you get used to them two minuses make them only 4 out of 5 stars first the customer support is weak there is supposed to be a website for the product for customer support and replacement parts but altec lansing his it linked to a seemingly unrelated product second the volume control is a little heavy unless you have somewhere to clip it to this might be a problem for runners ||| 1
this cf card is so fast that i can run my shutter on my camera non stop until the card is full at a frame rate of 3.5 fps no lag or slow down that is amazing it makes my camera perform better canon rebel xt ||| 1
fast and worth the mone ||| 1
perhaps the ultimate addition to a good camera i used my camera with a sandisk pro duo the blue one and while most times it was fine when i needed to take pictures in quick succession it let me down the ultra ii is noticably faster you will not regret buying this ||| 1
the sandisk 512 mb secure digitial ultra ii sent to me was not the item i ordered i returned the item unopened ||| 1
definitely recommend this memory card download time is great ||| 1
i am happy to have several sandisk products and all of them are excellent ||| 1
the sandisk is absoultely worth the extra money if you love to take many pictures without worrying about how many pictures are left for you to take it is great to use with if your camera has this feature ||| 1
the cheapest option i found at the time but an excelent pen drive small and with a good style ||| 1
it works great ! i really like it there is one small problem though the lid is really hard to take off ! i 've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little but not much there has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on but is n't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it i appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion ||| 1
works well with or without software installed good for home use and school or traveling ||| 1
this technically works well i am finding learning to use it difficult i really wish i had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one ! ! ! ! ! it is a lot smaller than i thought it would be and would be alot easier if it was bigger ||| 1
i was considering purchasing a tablet and wacom was consistantly recommended i was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because i didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line the intuos line i was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong installing a driver was a piece of cake and i began drawing away in minutes it is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs paintshop pro painter photoshop the mouse is pretty useless however and i would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead they seem to wear out though i do press pretty hard other than that its an amazing product ||| 1
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product ||| 1
great batteries for cameras they charge quickly and it 's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time just in case '' ||| 1
i bought the nulooq product a few weeks ago with little expectation and actually with some doubts it 'd do anything for me as i 'm a keyboard junkie the product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot but what a surprise just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price the menu thing is cool i do n't use it as much for putting tools but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place i guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around but i do n't seem to use that as much i still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around hey i was skeptical about the product like anyone else but found myself a rare surprise good job logitech ||| 1
i 've had this product for well over a year now and was using it with my xp machine and am now using it with my apple mac mini works great with both windows and mac os x with no hassles the removable stand is a nice touch as you can pack the reader into a laptop bag or lay it horizontally if you prefer highly recommended ||| 1
i have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters they are burning at in my nec burner that is pretty considering that it is advertised at hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years ||| 1
shipping was outrageous thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a f'n postage stamp but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than i did for the item could have bought it at walmart for less this way buyer beware i got took ||| 1
this is the second keyboard i 've purchased not because the first one broke because it 's such a great keyboard now i keep one at home and take one with me when i go lanning the only issue with the keyboard is the lcd is pretty useless is fast paced fps games otherwise it 's good for keeping the clock up so one does n't lose track of the time ||| 1
i 'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i 'm very happy ||| 1
my new tv finally arrived and i am very pleased with it i picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews i could find online the vast majority of which were very positive cnet has lots of reviews as well also i have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of tvs all day every day and both of them bought this exact set for themselves my cable provider does not offer many high def stations yet so the image quality of standard def video was the primary criterion for me most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite my first impression had me rather worried i have since come to believe that poor quality standard def video is just a matter of garbage in garbage out i began to suspect this when i noticed that some stations looked much better than others in fact some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them i became convinced as i watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time the video of the host looked ok the video of one contributor was poor and the video of the other contributor looked great the video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen the set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic standard def video i expect that i just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser tvs the quality of the hi def video is breath taking was simple and i have not even bothered yet to read the manual of course the display can be adjusted in many ways but it looks good to me with the factory presets and i do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon flipping through the on screen menu i stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since i live at above sea level i was a little disappointed with the delivery situation i thought i had ordered the tv in time to have it by opening day instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season and i was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that i blame the shipper eagle usa for this not amazon i say this because i could track the package enough to know that amazon had the tv picked up right away but then eagle usa kept it sitting in dallas for almost 2 weeks and then in denver for another week before finally calling me to arrange for delivery i believe that if i had not called and emailed amazon to complain about the delay it would have taken longer eagle usa told amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but i know that this is not true for two reasons 1 i had called eagle usa the same day they told amazon this and eagle usa told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery and 2 my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and i have a very good message and caller id tracking system in place all in all a great set at a great price i just wish i had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner ||| 1
so i was a little weary to buy an itrip after hearing some mixed reviews it seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs or the itrip worked perfectly knowing my luck it would n't work for me at all i recieved my itrip and my luck started right away i tossed the itrip onto my ipod and nothing a bad omen well after i exchanged my itrip for a new one i tried it out on a short drive i live in east lansing mi and we have a very crowded fm dial i could n't find a completely blank station as recommended but it did n't matter my itrip delivered decent sound through the station as others have mentioned charging your ipod while you use your fm transmitter will really help it 's not a difference but it 's a noticeable improvement sure i got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal but you know what through a good 40 minutes of driving the majority of the time i had satisfactory sound this was also on the lx mode not dx supposedly dx provides a better stronger signal this product is dependant on several outside factors the reception your car gets and the availability of a clear fm channel to rate this product poorly because of factors out of it 's control is unfair there were times when i had downright poor sound and times where it was comparable to a tape deck i love good crisp sound as much as anyone does but i 'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday my recommendation after owning this product for a short time it has been used quite a bit already as i do a lot of i say if you can buy a tape deck adaptor but if it 's not an option and you do n't want to put the money into an ipod to car '' setup this is a viable solution indeed in my opinion an itrip is a better option than listening to plain old radio ||| 1
i have used the for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it 's biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an abc '' book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use ||| 1
nice sound i will admitt for the price i get big sound with quality only thing is a humming hissing sound when machine is idle ohtherwise worth it ||| 1
i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must '' plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice ||| 1
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue ||| 1
i bought this tv for college and it fits perfectly in my dorm the picture quality is pretty decent though compared to traditional tv it is not as sharp the audio quality is very good i was able to play final fantasy 12 with this tv and the audio lives well for my expectations no lag while playing my playstation 2 console the only downside is that if you want to switch from av mode back to tv mode you need to press source '' on the remote or the tv 4 times and it 's annoying waiting for it but besides that it 's a very nice budget tv for anyone that wants a tv that can save you some money and space ||| 1
we used this charger with a dc inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a sony camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges the battery is great ||| 1
the tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad the mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks opening programs is one of them it also has a scroll wheel on the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling i use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with the pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines it fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser the only complaint i have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them the lower one is placed in a spot where when i 'm drawing my finger frequently hits it because of this i simply had to make the button inactive over all i feel that wacom has done a very good job of developing this product i feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price i would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet it is nice to have if you have the desk space i 've heard wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that i own one i believe it ||| 1
fabulous product now i can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range happy i purchased this one very trouble free ||| 1
i would n't be without this when i first bought the it was my first digital slr and i spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap in the end i settled for using both and would n't have it any other way with the battery grip and hand strap in place i find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold that 's all there is to it that 's what it does and it does it well on the down side and it 's a small and transient down side actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you 'd sort of expect it to be insecure i think the trick security wise is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap if used i also do n't like the attachment to the neck strap i do n't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use i use this on a which typically has a or lens attached you can only use this if you also use the battery grip or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location but since i always use the battery grip i do n't have an issue if canon read this you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price you normally pay close attention to detail and it 's a bit lacking here ||| 1
i have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of memorex and so far i have not had any problems they work just fine on my sony dvd burner ||| 1
memorex 's are the best price keeps dropping and never have a problem ||| 1
i have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months i have only had 1 burn badly have n't found a dvd player yet that they wo n't play in ||| 1
this is an excellent machine i bought two of them there are a few things you need to do i have had 100 satisfaction using fujifilm up to i have had success with fujifilm up to also had tremendous success with tdk up to and some other brands may not work one thing learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little go recording 3 or 4 or dvds every day give it a rest between recordings one or two per day is okay definitely give it room to breathe if you stack your machines on top of each other put something in between so they can breathe be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides you definitely need to buy a panasonic dvd player to play back your dvds other brand dvd players may not play your recordings properly one of the greatest things about this machine is that it records they are for many many times and each program can be erased when watched you can even edit the recordings on the cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program only works on the i have over 50 discs panasonic brand they sure take up less space than vcr tapes ! get one or two of these recorders and a panasonic dvd player and got it made ! throw away your vcrs forever ! just remember to baby them ||| 1
i bought this for my folks for christmas it took no time at all to hook up and making dvds was simple everything from recording off the tv to recording movies and shows stored on the dvr to transferring home movies from the original vhs tapes i 'm sure for about 300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders but for under 200 you really ca n't go wrong the only flaw i could find is that the initial hookup according to the book did n't seem quite right after taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online everything went smoothly because of that i 'm still going to give it a full 5 's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life really if you 're new to this technology you 're not going to have any ||| 1
the other effusive reviews are the picture is fabulous on new dvds lord of the rings nemo harry potter a 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job we have the sony 42 '' rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination a few annoyances the machine responds and loads slowly but that 's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price and certain dvds of old movies some like it hot the king and i stretch the picture horizontally making things look squat i 'm sure there 's a solution but just ca n't figure it out any tips ||| 1
vhs to dvd disc is just one easy setup i set mine to record and recode just before i go to sleep when i wake up a finished disc awaits with the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct vhs that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape i have taken many vhs tapes that were never released as dvd and now have the start of a great library editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it the product works well ipod old music videos and movies for a real treat sound is perfect ||| 1
i 've had this photo printer a few weeks now i do n't consider myself technically proficient i totally scored despite gross ignorance with this machine you can not go wrong the photo quality is astonishing i 've printed professional quality photos and framed them the results are fantastic for someone who is i had this up and running very quickly ||| 1
two of these jewel cases equal the size of a regular cd case buy them and conserve space there great ||| 1
got my order quickly and found out that these cases are much better than the ones sold here locally and they were cheaper ! ! ||| 1
i like keeping all my stuff in one place but do n't like cd folders so these slim cases are great i accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack the case did n't break and the cd was fine all in all a great product ||| 1
i 've used these and similar cases for years no problems even with the cats occasionally knocking them around and walking on them 1 i 've never had one crack 2 they hold the disc securely but not with so much force that you risk damaging the disc when removing it 3 as long as you open them properly from the front clear side by pulling near the corner s while holding the back colored side they open fine ||| 1
they are okay for eight or so dollars but they do n't last very long then again i used these for a digital camera so maybe that 's why they get drained so quickly however for the price i still would buy them again ||| 1
my daughter uses a cochlear implant that has the option of being powered by 3 aa batteries we have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest we have tried energizer duracell etc she needs to replace them every day and a half since the implant is a high power draining device every extra hour counts these batteries are one of the best values out there ||| 1
i have not had coverage for this apple product however i had a washing machine covered by them the washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off throughout was great and made every effort to fix the machine when the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that i paid for it they did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that i actually had the machine ||| 1
esaki si ta campion un tremendo idea di e sistema pa por load up un potret digital ariba bo pc hopi bon y facil esaki ta pone cu bo por saca bo potret digital y pone ariba bo pc via e systema aki di chip tremendo ||| 1
initial setup could be complex for some but considering all it is capable of i 'd say it 's worth the time investment ||| 1

these are great earbuds i have alswys used sony dj headphones in the past and these are the first pair of buds i have purchased i am impressed for the money the sound quality is very good full and well rounded with good bass and the treble is not too bright they are pretty comfortable in the ears but it does take a little getting used to the cord is rather thin and very flexible but seems to be sturdy enough for most use the included 'case ' is a little tough to figure out but could be good for keeping them clean in a purse or backpack definitely recommended ||| 1
i bought this for my kids to use with nascar racing controls are easily reprogramable nice product for the money ||| 1
great product for getting all those old home videos on dv ||| 1
this little unit is easy to use and ready to go ! ! ! ! not one problem with it so far i 've been using it for over two months now ||| 1
i use these batteries when i need power immediately and i do n't have a set of rechargeables ready to go i also use them as backups so i do n't get caught without power and have to pay 1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores unfortunately my kids keep stealing them instead of recharging their own set ||| 1
excellent sound system reminds you of being in a movie theatre great great system ||| 1
i 've owned many sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality lots of hardy walkmen useful shortwave and portable radios stylish tvs and high quality cassette recorders i still have a sony mini component stereo model made in japan which i bought in 1992 for us but rather than pay to fix its cd player i decided to purchase this new sony component stereo made in china pluses decent sound good functionality easy and intuitive operation simple remote but only covers basic functions cons very short speaker leads unattractive styling for my tastes resembles a boombox only holds 3 cds vs 5 for comparable panasonic units at first glance i was disappointed by the cheap construction skimpy manual and very short speaker leads the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies but then i thought in 2006 for 150 i ca n't expect the same quality as i received in 1992 for 400 everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in china so for the money it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom the real test will be how long the cd changer works to be safe this time i bought the 2 year replacement warranty i have n't blasted it at full volume but it seems to have plenty of power when needed i originally bought a 300 panasonic unit sd micro system which was returned because it did n't have the full data recording feature as advertised data recording was crippled by drm limitations this sony stereo costs half as much and has almost all the same functionality ||| 1
a memory stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a sony camera fantastic ||| 1
this portable cd holder is perfect for me i work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym my cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd 's i like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch i would recommend it to anyone ||| 1
note to brian the be configured as a bridge i have two of them in just such a configuration took me about 10 minutes to set them up major modes of operation are 1. wireless access point its default 2. wireless client connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the and you now have a wireless ethernet device 3. wireless repeater extend range of wireless coverage 4. wireless bridge connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them acts as one end of a virtual '' cable you need two to get the job done a pair of wireless bridges is just what i needed but hesitated to buy the because of brian 's comment that this would n't work because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that brian was wrong i bought a pair and they do work i rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons 1. i understand that more expensive equipment can be had with more range than this box got ta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment ! 2. one must dig very deeply into the users guide a pdf on the cd to find the default ip address in order to configure this device luckily i had read elsewhere what that ip address is other manufacturers make this info readily available even going so far as printing it on the device itself this will be critical info to any linux user also the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is admin '' well it 's not the only allowed userid is an empty field this had me going for a few minutes 3. something that 99 of the world wo n't care about i like to have more access to the firmware for example other linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do analysis of the box and the network it 's attached to i think there are firmware loads that enable this ||| 1
i love the mobilemate sd i have n't had any problems yet it 's small compact and gets the job done ||| 1
i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again ||| 1
the first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it does n't come with software for handhleds that person chose to buy it without and save some and then complained about having to pay extra for it because bought the wrong software package delorme did the right thing and offered us options i just ordered mine and i have no plans on using with a hh so i 'm very happy that i did n't have to buy the hh software just do n't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it nemerous people have highly recommended this to me although i have heard that ms mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option storing data points without a connection to a computer is awesome i will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route elevation etc too bad it is only in ||| 1
i got this jacket a month into having my ipod i had to buy it because i had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when i pulled the ipod out of that case it was easy to drop one time i did drop it and within a month of owning the ipod i had it in fro repairs this case protected my ipod of another 11 months just fine my complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out it is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface it will protect your pod though ||| 1
the product works perfectly the only problem is the manual only includes directions for the most common setups to use one port as an uplink '' to a router for example you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled 1 '' and then leave port 2 '' open the directions do not state this and i had to call linksys to get it to work other than that it is fast reliable and small perfect ||| 1
my setup dell latitude intel chip win xp pro wireless router with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna enabled the wep feature i unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in windows found the new card and did its thing not only was i was able to get on the internet immediately but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that i could n't 'see ' with my cisco aironet card this i sort of expected but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers the cd installed just fine but when i went to the site to check for an updated driver it said i was i ran windows update and it claimed i had an updated driver available for my new card i 've never had a problem with 's website or customer service while we 're on the subject so i was a bit taken aback that microsoft was ahead of 's site either way install the card and get onto the internet then have windows update check for possible updates be sure to enable the encryption feature if you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors ca n't go snooping through your stuff or worse lift the signal and ultimately your personal information i 've had no problems with my current i highly recommend this card to bring your ||| 1
this review pertains specifically to the targus 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub the cord is about 2.5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk ||| 1
i had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it it had gotten very good reviews ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some highly recommend it ||| 1
i 've been a gamer for almost 20 years this is the best mouse i 've ever owned it is fast accurate well formed and constructed i would definitely recommend it the dpi adjustment is a nice touch i prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy this mouse is just right ||| 1
for those of you who bought minidisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording this product is wonderful especially good for recording lectures voice lessons etc it works quite well with the mono mike or you could use an external one one of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike you toggle which setting it is in the settings section i record my radio shows by plugging in the from the station 's tape deck to my iriver for those who recorded live music with their minidiscs it 's a little trickier you have to set the record input before you ca n't change it on the fly i 've recorded live dj shows with the and agc on of course the booming bass distorts horribly but overall an easy record of the show very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show i 've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results a bit of trial and error which i 'm still refining with later iriver products the single aa batter lasts a good long time summer school involves 2 classes and i can record several days of them before battery is low if the battery runs out during recording fear not the file is saved ! the negatives are the requirement to go through the special iriver music program but there are now firmware updates that will change your iriver into the typical usb external drive files are recorded in a file which one then converts to a file after transfer to your computer i do n't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the file but you ca n't trasnfer files off your iriver even if you made them yourself so do n't think you can use this to transfer files from one computer to another also the molding where the input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some rca to '' adaptors so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way i 've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day whether just playing or recording classes i 'm only just starting to have some trouble with the button after so many presses it 's starting to wear out but it 's still working reliably i just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention i have the model which is great i was able to record a radio show marathon i produced with it previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs i 'm quite happy with iriver and plan on buying from them in the future ||| 1
i got this for hubby and me over the summer we used it for our trip to rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it we have a tape deck in the car and used it a cassette adaptor we had not problems whatsoever in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter i did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next but i do n't think anybody can improve upon that i had the same problem my itrip we chose sirius for several reasons i liked the classic vinyl station my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007. the only problem i had was i could n't read the red lettering in the daylight the sunglasses on but i did n't give them less than 5 stars because of this this is the way to go plus it has a suction mount not a permanent mount also if you look on ebay someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat ! ! definitely go satellite the music is great and no commercials depending on the stations ||| 1
works good small and comes with handy little stickers to put on so you can write contact info in case you lose it though slightly costl ||| 1
i purchased this hub back in september i plugged it in and i 'm running two printers and my mouse off of it at the moment i 've had no problems it does n't take up too much room even with 7 ports my only complaint is n't with amazon it 's with after i sent in the rebate info i got a card from saying my request was n't valid because i had n't purchased it from the right store but i called them and in about 10 minutes i had the problem cleared up and had my rebate a week later i highly recommend keeping copies of all the rebate info just in ||| 1
fantastic take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality ||| 1
the product is a good value it performed well and was fairly easy to use i only wish it would allow importing play lists from itunes all text had to be manually input overall i 'm very satisfied with the product ||| 1
i previously owned the lexar cf card and thought that was the fastest a cf could get i was completely wrong this card is one fast sucker and it can hold an enormous amount of images in jpeg mode i am able to store over 1000 images in raw mode which i 'm converting to thanks to this large capacity card i am able to hold 444 images all on my ! ! ! if your thinking of buying this card do n't hesitate it is one awsome piece of equipment and one heck of an investment ! ! ||| 1
this is an excellent buy and is a quality item the service was fast and the card works as expected ||| 1
a lot of space my computer is over old so i use these cd 's as a great back up for storing all my old documents my ebooks and my pics ||| 1
these earphones are the best i ever had i never had to try other pairs of earphone because i absolutely loved these that i keep buying it ! after 6 years i buy the same one everytime of course i never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that i brought but ca n't seem to throw them out because it costed money it seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and i can answer why thats happening it 's actually static electricity i experienced it myself a couple of times because i was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form it 's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones i suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked the bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones hey for 10 bucks or less you ca n't except sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model i abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year i think these are the best rather than buying something thats 100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost broken or stolen ||| 1
after having two sandisk card readers and one lacie card reader die on me i invested in this lexar card reader for the money it has worked flawlessy with pro compact flash cards up to in size i am very impressed with the transfer speeds and the unit is not too big for traveling the door that covers the slot however is very flimsy and easily deattaches but fortunately easily reattaches too i use mac os x and it works just fine i also used it with windows xp without any installation or transfer issues ||| 1
a simple cheap investment this cf reader actually does what it should transfer info from compact flash to the computer previous kodak 1.0 reader had issues after a few weeks and stopped working after 2 months this one is much faster and is still working ahhhhh ||| 1
just some specs missing from amazon 's description usb 2.0 compactflash reader small and travels with ease led status indicator indicates when files are being transferred data transfer speeds up to backward compatible with usb 1.1 ships with removable usb 2.0 cable features designed for large data transfers like images music and video data transfer 5 to 6 times faster than using usb 1.1 portable weighs only 1.5 ounces protective cover case keeps reader pins away from external hazards compatible with windows and mac os x and 9.1 no drivers required with most current operating systems limited warranty ||| 1
i purchased the adorama slinger bag after first purchasing the tamrac velocity 5. the tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag unfotunately it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle the slinger bag addressed both of these deficiencies when worn as a waist bag it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag there are two water pouches on the slinger bag which is a real requirement as i live in arizona the adorama slinger bag is a great travel bag it is light weight and has great utility i highly recommend it ||| 1
this was the least expensive 1 gb memory card i have ever seen and it works as well as it should ||| 1
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it ||| 1
great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your ipo ||| 1
the memorex discs are great i have a lacie external burner that i use with my mac and i have not yet burned a bad disc i would reccommend this product to anyone looking for lots of media for a good price ||| 1
manufactured of a soft gray felt like material a tough leather bottom and draw string closure at the top this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements i store my lenses in a camera bag and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space this case is meant for use with the canon usm usm lenses these l lenses normally come with the case when sold new there is no need to buy one as amazon often suggests however if your case is worn replacing it to protect your lens is recommended pros protects your glass investment cons i can not think of an ||| 1
this cf card is perfect for anybody who needs a high capacity for pics but does n't care about the transfer speed it may be a bit annoying though especially if you try to download all the from the card to your hard drive because it takes some time i do still consider it a real good purchase ||| 1
this memory card handles the job really well unless maybe you 're a professional sports photographer it 's plenty fast enough no problems using it with my canon rebel xt it holds about 550 pictures jpegs at the highest resolution 8.2 mp ||| 1
i have only had this monitor for a couple of day 's but i am verry happy with it it came well packaged and you cant beat the price i shopped around and this was the one for me i dont know about the other review but with in 5 min of opening the box i was using the monitor and it worked verry well ! ! thank 's amazon ||| 1
i had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up but after a little tweaking it works beautifully previously owned regular crt what an improvement ! superb clarity and brightness for the money you just ca n't go wrong with this one ||| 1
i use the pink circles to buff the and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd as i thought it would well i thought that those marks would disappear after i used the repair paste with the yellow circles but they 're still there is it supposed to be like this the reason i bought the thing was to make the cds look like new but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over could someone answer this question for me please ||| 1
with boys aged 2 3 and some poor disc storage procedures when i 'm driving it appeared i was in need of one of these units generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs but it occassionally happens and does n't take long for scratches damage and finger prints to hinder performance and when changing children 's cds in the car i do n't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also i read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products and finally decided on this unit because it runs on power is fully contained and automatic and was about 10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit both items had mixed reviews mostly positive but i found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products i 'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all and one that skipped this product repairs a disc to useable '' condition it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible i can still see but not necessarily feel the scratches it 's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance if a disc plays well but shows scratches i just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair i agree that the instructions with the unit could be better i saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity also some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair so i agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items but it is possible i noticed that i could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the pink disc process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair i ran one disc through 3 times in a row then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine my lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great i usually clean the disc manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime then buff then repair it can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable i think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use ||| 1
so far i havent filled up my disc yet using it the disc that came with it would fill up after 3 minutes of talking so far its great ||| 1
i 've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed this is not true if you 're carefull first of all my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned off when you change the batteries pretty simple huh also do n't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it the main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner and i just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10 i primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and i love it ||| 1
i 've been using these memorex for years and have no problems with their reliability have used them with multiple cd and dvd burners without compatibility issues this was another and i continue to be happy with this product ||| 1
the product arrive to me in very good condition will recommend this product to anyone who needs blank cd ||| 1
for the most part i just want to keep it short i usually always by energizer cause they 're reasonably priced and seem to last much much longer then most other battery products that i have used in the past ||| 1
these batteries are great and seem to fit my rio 500 better than some discount batteries good price too ||| 1
i have been using this hub for about six months the power light started flickering after about three months and now does n't light at all the hub works great but i wonder how long it will last ||| 1
i use my usb hub every day and it works fine with every device i plug into it ||| 1
i 'm very happy with this product it 's great value for the price the corded phone with answering machine means there 's always a phone that 's not dead and perfect for the home office area the cordless phone can be used to check the answering machine messages lot 's of features ||| 1
the unit itself works great much faster transfers than using the usb cable directly to my camera however the software includes a monitoring '' feature which checks every second or so to see if you 've plugged in a card i opened up windows task manager to discover that each time it checked it was consuming 25 of system resources each second no wonder my computer has been slower lately especially if i have my image editing software open duh my recommendation would be to skip the san disk software and access the card reader directly from my computer as mentioned in another review below ||| 1
great quality excellent construction and strong plugs i have worked with a decent share of and i have never had to cut and terminate a belkin cable due to regular wear and tear ||| 1
my husband i searched searched for dvd 's that were compatable to our dvd recorded no one could help then i thought i 'll just check on amazon '' and sure enough there they were ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! what a relief ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i would hate to own a dvd recorder not be able to record anything ! ! ! ! ! thank you ! ! ! ||| 1
this unit is a good buy it is priced low but functions like you paid a higher price the negatives are that it is n't compatible with itunes and the earphones are not very ergonomically designed overall it is a good product ||| 1
i 'll try to keep this short and sweet if you have been frustrated trying to get am reception on the go then you 've found the right radio for you i ca n't tell you how many pieces of junk i 've bought that barely even relatively close am stations unless i constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception luckily those other radios also died pretty quickly this sangean product solves the am reception problem and seems very durable i also own their ccradio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation i love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the speaker just like transistor radios of the 50 's and 60 's a seemingly forgotten feature as for listening through the supplied earphones forget it sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied never have i heard tinnier sound even for am listening not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short i immediatey invested another 35 in decent pair of koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin now i happily and easily listen to am and fm stations even over the roar of the lawnmower there might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to fm exclusivey but if you spend even a little time on the am dial i really do n't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio ||| 1
sound great nice bank for the buck did the follower think they would fit inside his ear maybe he is bitter with the drm and scam that job 's is screwing people over with he 's worse than microsoft i love '' followers ||| 1
this was my second dlo transpod i had an older white one that i bought used i figured i would upgrade '' to this one since my ipod and my car 's interior are black overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one but with a few little changes for one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts that normally does n't matter if you choose a good empty frequency but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect next i ca n't turn it up any where near the volume i used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static it seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it last the most annoying part of this whole product is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use i have paused my ipod to take a phone call only to have very loud since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume static and sometimes radio stations coming through very embarrassing or when you stop your car and then come back as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise since my car does n't leave me many options for stereo replacement this is the best product for my specific situation though i may try and get that old one back from my friend maybe an upgrade '' to a newer one will settle the deal ||| 1
you must have received without the cassette component by mistake is prepackaged with the cassette component ||| 1
worked perfectly battery does not run low after a few hours off the base ||| 1
i use this keyboard at work and as i am a medical transcriptionist it is all i use all day l o n g really like it and i 'm going to buy one for my home as well it is very easy to type on and i like the wrist support ||| 1
this receiver is a replacement for an older more expensive defective sony that i had it was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units i am satisfied with the product ||| 1
the reviews sounded too good to be true the reviews are right on this system is perfect for home theater i have the latest panasonic plasma this receiver is the perfect compliment here is why i could only start with at 2.1 set up and no sub woofer great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison tons of connectors unless you need hdmi the available connectors are perfect the speaker connectors are screw plug type for easy secure connection lots of component video and rca video inputs lots of analog audio connections and two digital coax and one optical i use the digital coax for my and for my cable box really easy set up i could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver the manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures did i mention the sound frys offers polk audio for an indecently low price with this receiver the sound is rich great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels adding a cerwin vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all best of all my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before i got home and pronounced it beautiful it was the only low profile receiver i could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station the end result i sat down and just watched hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation all for less than the cost of me and the missus going to the movies for a few weekends get this receiver ||| 1
this item does exactly what it 's suppose to do it also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception worth the money only drawback would be there is a lot of cord hanging around ||| 1
the sony are a solution to good directional sound for a very small room though i have not had the opportunity to test the up to frequency the highs on these speakers sound very well maybe only slightly boxy note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread the sound is very flat the lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space especially if you stand further away over 5 from the speakers it seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level however do n't get discouraged because with most it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in loosen the diaphragm to get a bit more sustain '' to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff the bass is very punchy and not deep i would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers as their highs are very good and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat the subwoofer will party compensate for the problem and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect use the lfe on your receiver for the do n't worry low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo wo n't suffer in other words you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their box quality ignore the rating for sound as a positive feature as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output most are rated for 20 hz at a reasonable rms you get what you pay for for the price tag on them the are good they perform reasonably well on highs and mids but in no means studio reference sound and are crisp and punchy on the bass they do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity especially so on the bass the further you move away from them and especially if you stand up above them the sound quality suffers i would recommend wharfedale diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you 're willing to expand your budget a bit polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound i also the 100 per pair cat sdat i think i saw them on overstock for 80 with free shipping they are a bit shady but excellent for the price seems that the 20 hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate if you 're looking for deep and sound without a and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your budget solution '' instead of the i was pleasantly surprised they also have poor sensitivity though so if you have a big room shop around for something better ||| 1
i listen to a wide range of music from hard rock to classical and i 've found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this at least until i ordered this set i was apprehensive about buying online and also about the sony brand for speakers but i 'm very happy with this purchase i 've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends the highs are crisp and the bass is tight not boomy the soundstage is expansive of course this depends a lot on your receiver as well and imaging good i 'd definitely recommend this speaker set ||| 1
this first time i use the hd product in my home video system and have the expected results after i installed it and it immediately scan all the signal channels in my local area and have good quality so far i place the antenna in door just in the first floor i do n't have too many channels in my living area in oh ||| 1
i bought my player sep 2006 and the other code did not work it is actually a see manual though it says on the player here is how to do it if you have the model says on the box on the manual the hack is make sure you have no dvd in the tray on the remote control 1 press title '' 2 press 1 '' and then 9 '' on the tv a large box with a small number will appear the number indicates for which dvd region the machine has been set for example 2 '' for germany or 0 '' for no region code 3 press the up arrow or down arrow to raise or lower the number 4 press enter '' done ||| 1
worked very well as planed just heavy to carr ||| 1
i would have given it a five star but sense it 's the only one i have ever used i had nothing to compare with i have used it nine tines and it worked perfect every time sturdily made ||| 1
the idea is excellent the execution is flawed what is not made clear at the time of purchase is that you will need a bridge or gaming adapter as well as a high speed internet connection at home the adapter should be built into the box another disappointing factor is that the quality of the video is almost unwatchable if the connection is not robust there should be a cache memory built in so that a clear unchoppy video and sound come through ||| 1
one of the best i 've ever bought the installation and connection was completely flawless it worked the first time and has been working since and i even used the powerline ethernet adapter to connect back to my router i have my cable tv on one input and my security system on the secondary input using my cellular data connection on my laptop i can watch tv or look at my security system from anywhere in the country ||| 1
box worked perfectly as expected however it would be nice to be able to upgrade firmware to the new hd like performance or via a program to allow old customers to upgrade to the new sling boxes ||| 1
this box is perfect to have all the basic ipod accesories at once i have the 60 mb video ipod and all the accesories works perfect ||| 1
despite some of the negative reviews of this item it continues to perform well with my ipod in fact it has more volume depth and presence than three other portable speakers each costing 50 to 75 more to which i 've compared it the only downside is that the item is no longer sold from amazon diminishing its bargain '' appeal somewhat these and priced speakers perform as advertised the sound is more than adequate they 're small enough that i can take the stephen colbert report with me on walks when not in use they fold up into a mini my only misgiving is whether i should have spent more for a unit with a dock connector but for under twenty bucks you simply wo n't find a better sounding more compact unit ||| 1
i liked these speakers they are small compact they work great with my player and you ca n't really beat the price my only complaint is that they do n't come with an adapter but i just bought rechargeable batteries and the system work great i use them everyda ||| 1
these headphones are lightweight fairly comfortable and sound head and shoulders better than any pair of 20 headphones i 've ever heard here are the aspects people always want to know about bass these do n't pound your eardrums in but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones i 've heard you can really follow the bass line with these rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration this is the reason to buy these headphones not too bright but very clear warm smooth soothing and musical the first time i listened to music on these i was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string something i 'd never heard before on that song in fact i blame these headphones on my new addiction to well headphones these obviously ca n't play as loudly as 200 headphones and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach but everything in the middle is very good i do n't think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under 100 and being under 20 you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money i should go work for these guys or something SMILE ||| 1
i was wondering if anyone knew if this hub would work for linking xbox 's together so you can have more than 4 people play at once i know that i could link 2 with a crossover cable but i want to link 4 together so that i can have a gigantic 16 player halo match it 's a very popular xbox game for those who do n't know ||| 1
nothing much to say about them they 're high quality high speed rewritable discs that do what they are supposed to do i 've been using these kind of rewritable discs for a while now and i have n't had any problems with them what so ever even when i burn at higher than they come with cases too so you wo n't have to worry about scratching the cds ||| 1
i matched this model number up with the phone i have and it is a perfect fit for the phone and for me i stay on the telephone for lengthy conference calls most of my workday and the headset types that go in the ear ended up causing soreness this headset sits gently over my head with the earpiece lying on my ear i 'm told i can be heard very clearly without echo or fadeout i would highly recommend this headset ||| 1
i bought this because my windshield suction mount could not be trusted i 've had it fall off more than once then you drive around wondering if your 700 nuvi is going to fall and break not fun ! the friction mount works for me for everyday driving even aggresive driving it stays put someone on this site left feedback about using it with their nuvi 360 and i used their review to make the purchase i 'm glad i did ||| 1
i think this is as good as the expensive over 60 hdmi cables i would n't spend money on the expensive ones first of all i 'm not a cable junkie nor an expert however according to my research there 's no difference in performance the expensive version nor the 12 15 20 version when it comes to hdmi since it 's all hole buch of zeros and ones the durability of the cables i do n't know but unless you 're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason it would n't matter normally you 'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time so the durability is not really relevant bottomline this is as good as the expensive ones i first tried out the expensive monster brand which was 85 then i returned it after purchasing this for the quality was the same do n't buy the expensive ones ||| 1
this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well ||| 1
this product is a nice headset that did fit nicely on my ear lucky fit i guess and was easy to work with it is compact and feels quite natural for me not to mention it is designed to work on either ear so in the middle of a conversation you can just change ears ||| 1
i am pleased with this printer considering the price it is a good value the cartridges are kind of expensive but i guess most cartridges are these days ||| 1
pros small reliable very good quality with pictures ease of use good software easy install affordable cons ink tends to run out quickly with pictures slow rate of printing usb cable not included overall 5 amazonian stars for the average user ||| 1
this is truly a excellent headphones at a great price wonderful all around phones would make a great gift also ||| 1
i have been using these for a while now and they seem pretty good to me disclaimer i am not an audio professional nor do i have any expensive headphones to compare with they have great detail in both low and high end in fact i can hear things in some of my music that i never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam style or earbud styles this is good when listening to original cds or hq but it did reveal some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality that i had just not heard before i tested these with a frequency response program on my mac show as having hz in my ears your ears may vary this range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds they do a good job of blocking out external noises great if you are in a bit of a noisy space and yes they were a bit tight on the head initially to fix that i got a stack of cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches pun intended this has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now ok to wear for long periods note this procedure is at your own risk as i do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg SMILE do not overstretch them as the headband material while flexible undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take great bargain headphones ||| 1
not an audiophile but someone looking to spend a decent amount of money on a quality set of headphones this product nails all the requirements great sound great comfort well built i 'll be buying more of these guys for friends and family ||| 1
do n't let the reviews fool you at this price it 's worth a little research apparently is annoying a lot of people and the people at have created an uninstall download for you to get so google it download it and buy the usb drive the size of this usb drive and the fact that you 'll never have to worry about losing the cap along with an excellent price make it worth buying after you uninstall the software it works like any other drive it works great it just takes you ten minutes of a little extra work i 'm very satisfied so far and have carried audio video and a lot lot more on a drive the size of a pen cap brilliant ||| 1
i bought these headphones a week ago and i am very pleased with them at the electronic store i listen to 3 pairs of sennheiser and i hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 10 more buck at the store the sound was ok as they were playing from the sennheiser display rack when i got home i plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better i am very impressed of the volume and sound quality i can get from them on my computer my soundcard is an onboard soundmax on an asus motherboard i set the sound option in windows xp on headphones '' and played nothing else matters '' with winamp wow ! ! ! i was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general i only use half of the volume available in windows xp and more than enough for me i do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but i found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source using the sound is better on my computer than on my harman kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my player than with the earbuds that came with it overall i would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price they blow away all the competition in the same price range compared to my old panasonic a drastic improvement especially for the bass response when it comes to music i love bass a lot but i would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level bass knob or equalizer so that way you get too much bass from them very good headphones go get a pair at this price you go wrong i highly recommand them for computer users music dvd movies and games ||| 1
this is one of the best wireless phones i 've had good call quality good speakerphone quality and good range ||| 1
panasonic makes good quality products and this is no exception easy to use very compact no interference with cordless usage ||| 1
i bought this phone to replace my older panasonic because i needed a new answering machine i love that i can retrieve messages from the handset the handset is a bit smaller than earlier models but just took some getting used to would definitely recommend ||| 1
i picked this up for 50 dollars to replace a uniden that had a sticky talk '' button and muffled sound qaulity the panasonic blows the uniden away the sound is clear crisp and intimate the ring selection is varied i prefer the nonobtrusive default setting the controls are easy to use the quality and finish of the materials is high i am now a loyal panasonic phone buyer ||| 1
it 's hard to believe the quality of the sound from this very small device 's sound great as do the voice recordings with 1 gig of space you can record an entire day of seminar speakers and still have space left the built in stereo or mono mics are great plus you can use it to carry files to and from work the function buttons are logical and easily accessed even with my big fingers priced right i 'm glad i purchased received it on time totally happy with my purchase my only wish is that it came with a case and a neck or wrist strap it 's so small it gets tossed into whatever pocket is available and that can lead to scratches from keys etc ||| 1
i am a success coach and i record all my coaching calls as a standard practice this recorder has performed fantastically in all situations i get about 9 12 continuous hours of battery operation depending on battery quality and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls i have an adapter for the phone i have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results i highly recommend using rechargeable batteries always have one extra on hand when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time recharge before your event each day and you wo n't miss a thing the unit only uses one battery and it 's always a great idea to have a spare the unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings each stop and restart begins a new file for me that works great ! if you are looking for one continuous file do not shut it off you can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use you would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money ||| 1
a good stuff at great price and as usual amazon was fast to send the item ||| 1
i decided to replace my iriver after a party cable adapter malfunctioned and fused the pin connection to the usb cable together i wanted usb 2.0 for the faster connection and a larger capacity but still desired standard user replaceable batteries on a flash based player so i picked this up on sale i may still search for a used iriver after playing with the lyra i like the ruggedness of the a bit more than the rca lyra pros user replaceable aaa batteries expandable sd slot up to 512 mb decent sound for biking and general yard work screen is able to be positioned at 0 or 180 degrees for easy reading from belt line in recording and voice for short memos 3 different color backlights for user preference decent battery life cons headphones are worthless placing them in ear prevents clips from holding them in place slow reaction on interface compared to older iriver player please wait '' belt clip is going to break after minimal usage like ink pen cap clips do does n't seem like usb 2.0 speed just normal usb 1.1 no armband or case available i used firmware 3.11 for my testing after upgrading from version 1.11 ||| 1
when i bought my intel imac '' lcd suddenly everything else looked dull in comparison this apple 20 '' is very close in spec to my imac 20 '' screen stores like best buy do not have good quality '' lcds in yet you want the profile also the regular square lcds look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios the newer stuff is very bright and clear it is obvious when you go to a store and look at the lcd screens the cheap 200 lcds just do n't look good in comparison to the new stuff intel imac screen 280 brightness in candle power contrast ratio apple 20 '' lcd 250 contrast response time other comparables gateway 21 '' 599 300 contrast dell 24 '' 800 1920 x 1200 500 contrast you should be aiming for at least 300 on brightness and close to contrast these apple lcds have been out for awhile and are starting to show their age in comparison to the brand new products that have just started to come out if you are using your lcd for a tv you may need the brightness but for computer work the mac 20 '' lcd is just about right i paid a few more 750 total price for the apple lcd but i feel i made the correct purchase i just did n't like the way the others looked and it had to look good against my imac i actually like this screen better than the one on my imac and it seems just as bright even if the specs say that it is not amazon also boxes the shipment besides the apple box so your screen should arrive undamaged ||| 1
i 've been slowly making my way to the mac side after nearly 15 years of unadulterated use the process has been slow mainly because of the price and availability of apple products high and scarce the best thing about apple is that their customer forums are full of people like you and me and if you have a problem someone else has most likely had it too those forums helped in my decision to purchase this monitor i had been looking closely at the 23 '' monitor when i read about a majority of the displays getting a pink tint after only a few hours of use i realized i would either wait until apple the monitor or look at other options with the 20 '' aluminum i did n't have to look far i wanted a monitor that would compliment my laptop powerbook but i did n't want to break the bank either the answer was turning to ebay 600 out the door mint condition saved over 150 and the monitor works and looks great ! the 20 '' and 30 '' models have had no problems if you can buy them new go for it if you can buy new but would rather spend that extra money on something else check out the ebay auctions ||| 1
i was looking for a basic cordless phone with out an answering machine and this one is great it has good reception and i like the size of it this phone is just what i was looking for ||| 1
these are the best portable headphones in this price range good bass and smooth natural sound in fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price if you can afford more consider the sennheiser for about dollars but if you 're on a budget or do n't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones these are definitely the ones to get ||| 1
excellent mount for the 2 tv 's i 've purchased was suprised to buy one about a month ago from for 149.95 then was able to buy this one for did i pay too much for the first mount ollie ||| 1

it 's not listed in the product description but the pico works with the ipod mini too like the other reviewers i found it easy to setup tune the radio turn on ipod connect the pico tune the pico done in my car the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio i noticed this as well with my home stereo maybe the next generation pico needs a larger antennae or my ipod needed charging regarding sound quality my other car has a ipod connector the pico sound quality is comparable somewhat muted but enjoyable the pico does offer the advantage of displaying the ipod menu to select tunes i 've read mixed reviews on other fm transmitters but i am pleased with the pico ||| 1
i ordered this device to sit on a player piano which can play ipod encoded files once they are transferred from the special cds that are designed for the piano the remote is limited as are all remotes for ipods but for the special use i have this is a great product it allows me to sit across the room and pause the piano or select the next piece of music ||| 1
i was looking for an inexpensive yet high quality long lasting and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane a fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace the brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly offering two lines of crisp highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs my experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape in fact i found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet since i purchased the 1750 i have found many uses for it around the home office and i wonder how i got by without one in the past ! my only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters it does not offer a dash or hyphen so when one is required i find myself using a star instead that is a minor complaint though the brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on aa battery power alone so i have not felt the need to purchase the adapter ||| 1
we recently purchased 4 of these phones and all of them work fine the cid works perfectly for both lines the takes a few minutes to learn and get used to but i would n't call it '' the redial button as you can see in the picture is right above the number pad if you ca n't find it you might want to buy a phone with less buttons and less features and it 's pretty simple to redial a number in the cid display when you to the number press enter twice once to bring up the menu '' and once more to dial '' in fact you can also save that number into the phone 's memory through the menu press enter once and scroll through the options ||| 1
at first i was not sure about if this windshield mounting bracket was going to stay in place while i drive trough the streets however i was very surprised when i found out that the bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another even under some vibration the suction rubber system is quite strong it has 2 angles for adjustment and you can rotate the gps pros strong suction rubber system gps mounting system cons lack of a angle for adjustment the gps can only be adjusted in the windshield plane so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing that 's why i give 4 stars ||| 1
very strong suction cup provides secure mounting quick and easy clip in and release for taking the gps with you product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways otherwise this is a and quality product ||| 1
the forums speak highly of these and i was going to get one because of the small form factor amazon 's description for the height at 2.5 '' is incorrect according to panasonic 's website should be listed as 3 '' makes a difference if you 're short on space ||| 1
i was paranoid about having buyer 's remorse from this unit for such a cheap price i was sure i would end up regretting the purchase what is the tradeoff shoot if know but i have n't regretted buying it one bit the receiver is perfect for home theater particularly dd 5.1 shows there is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content which is important for tv watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments as for power it 's not an even match with some of the more power hungry and expensive analog amplifiers out there but it easily crosses the threshold of annoying the neighbors digital is something to get used to on conventional receivers you turn the sound up high and it becomes somewhat sloppy or what some call warm '' not so with the digital panny it 's distortion free up to very high levels i would n't call it bright but the response is very linear and precise i like hearing all the details in music and cinema even at loud volume others do n't the weaknesses are very minor fm tuner is nothing special lacks fancy dsp modes of expensive receivers fancy on screen display must do most of the tweaking with knobs does not upconvert video remote control is an el cheapo for this price though who cares ||| 1
i purchased this receiver from fry 's electronics in san diego ca for 199.99 at first i was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver when i got it home and connected it i was amazed this receiver will blow you away with the precision of it 's home theater capabilities i am using four polk 's as my fronts and rear surround and two sony center channels for my front center and rear center channels i also have a klh tremor series powered subwoofer i estimate the entire system to cost about 650.00 total i have colleague that has a bose home theater system and my little system blows his out of the water and he paid much more for the bose if you want a great receiver a minimal price this is the way to go by the way did i mention that it has four digital inputs an optical output and hdmi in and out connections buy it ! ! ! ||| 1
the logitech stereo usb noice cancelling headset is awesome i never recieved the one i ordered from ant online but the one i bought later at walmart owns me ||| 1
i did a lot of research and finally ended up with this product 1 bose is an excellent piece but main drawbacks portability and lack of audio input from other devices 2 altec lansing basically a roun cylinder shaped one and i didnt get that in a black color for my 30 gb black video ipod and the sound wasnt that impressive as bose or for that matter logitech mm 50 3 apple 's ipod dock its a bulky one that is definitely not portable and costlier than the bose i went to bestbuy to listen to everything and logitech mm 50 really outweighs the other ones on these price portability and sound quality yea its not like bose or apple 's dock but really good for such a small piece the only thing i find a little difficult is i am not able to switch playlists with the remote its just for and sounds would 've been completely happy if had all that i could do in the ipod but i am very happy with the buy and will definitely recommend to bu ||| 1
i 've had 2 other fm transmitters a belkin and a griffin itrip neither came close to the quality of this transmitter neither charged the ipod the belkin required batteries which only lasted about 15 hours of use while the itrip worked ok at first but then started getting static no matter what station i used in fact i had to have the ipod in hand for the static to go away and then it was still not clear the sound is n't as loud as some it takes over the volume control so you cant use the volume on the ipod still it 's not nearly as soft as some i 've seen i found most music came through at a good volume i did adjust a few songs in itunes to pump them up this unit although it seems cheap and flimsy at first is able to get a consistant strong signal even on stations which usually come in clearly it powers through them and the result is a very clean sound it is a little hard to read at the regular angle but once you set the 3 presets you do n't need to see the screen just set your radio to the same configuration also turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer in all i could n't be happier ||| 1
at such low price this player is really pretty good it gets the job done even though the ui is a little bit basic it can record in and and has a 10 hour mode although in the 10 hour mode image is not so clear but still pretty good if view on the computer using 320 x 240 resolution and at such a low price you can get two or three to record different programs and archive some shows and it is still cheaper than the media center pc good thing is the disc is already a dvd playable in any player no need to burn it as opposed to if you are using tivo or media center pc ||| 1
quite acceptable in line with prior purchases at outlet where pixma was sol ||| 1
i 've had these headphones for just over two years and i 'm happy to see that they 're one of the few pairs marketed as surround sound '' that have done quite well the reason behind that is because they 're truly excellent headphones the range is spectacular and the inputs even more so you 're given the option of rca and toslink optical which is all you really need movies really do sound like movies you hear things behind in front and to your left and right when you 're connected via optical take note that dts also sounds 'boomier ' and a tad crisper than dolby d does especially in gladiator honestly i 've nothing to complain about as a college guy i could n't bring my 1010 watt system from home which i might add never sounded as good as my headphones mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my macbook pro truly does some incredible things you 'd be amazed at coldplay 's the scientist '' if you heard it on these headphones it 's indescribable and by the way i 'm a slight audiophile you seriously ca n't go wrong with these headphones and 65 for each additional pair of headphones allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station even better good idea for families in apartments incredibly advanced technology incredible sound and incredible results ca n't go wrong here oh and they 're extremely comfy ||| 1
i just recently purchased the quickcam stx for my sister who lives overseas in greece it 's a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis surprisingly the video and audio is quite good i do have a mac and she does n't have any issue calling me from her pc we use aol instant messenger video and audio or yahoo messenger video to connect i still prefer the isight for macs unfortunately you ca n't use an isight on a pc wish apple could make the isight compatible with pc 's anyhow the stx is a great cam for what it 's worth ||| 1

have had no problems with this item and it 's a good price for the powered kind of usb hubs which i have found are pretty necessary for most usb items ||| 1
i found the sound fantastic just got these after usinf shure for about a year i liked those but find these even better when i first tried them i found the base so much stronger than the as many have alluded to now i run my ipod at normal equalizer settings i find the balance of the set dead on the fit is great of course your milage may vary in fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable this means when i walk with them i can hear my footsteps this would be a real problem if i jogged low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected ||| 1
this is my second fm transmitter and works much better than the belkin that i ended up returning because it simply was n't working it plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there unlike the belkin i drive a 2001 bmw it is easy to use with the preset fm stations it works right out of the box you 'll be ready to go within seconds the sound is crisp with some static interference which can be expected in a big city unmounting my car 's antenna helps a little but does n't completely cure the interference i have a factory bmw business radio which picks up fm signals pretty much without an antenna there is nothing to mount the ipod so you 'll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately i would n't spend more than 45 on any fm transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas i wo n't be getting rid of my cd changer just yet ||| 1
i have had my axim for about three months i purchased it from dell for 480 with aluminum hardcase extra battery and auto power cord strengths just about everything the processor is absolutely incredible i heard unconfirmed that the intel 624 mhz is faster than a pentium 3 ! it sure seems like it this pda blazes through movies photos games word processing and anything else i can throw at it the other definite high point for this pda is the screen once you see a vga screen like this you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a qvga screen i have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels the screen is crystal clear the battery life is phenomenal even with the standard low capacity battery playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones turned off with a sd card drains the battery about 2 per day wifi is amazing it connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up once connected it keeps the signal well and is while not fast reasonable for speed just about everything on this pda is almost perfect weaknesses not enough programs to start with windows media player 10 download tcpmp it 's way better problems do n't use odyssey client it makes the pda start up really slow also in activesync on the pda select menu add server source on all of the screens put random characters in each field and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize then go to menu schedule and select manual for both then go to menu options and delete the entry that you just added the one that has no boxes under it checked and delete it it fixes a myriad of problems and makes the pda run faster and it still syncs automatically in the cradle conclusion an awesome pda that does just about everything combine it with a bt keyboard and perhaps even a bt mouse and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability everything works extremely well ||| 1
this phone has noticably greater range and clarity than our other wireless phones the message center works well and the intercom feature is useful the phone is a little small and similar to cell phones rather than a house wireless phone there are two generic rechargable nicad batteries i think they will be easier to find than some of the packaged nicads that come with most wireless phones ||| 1
this phone is small great battery life awesome range and no interference the features are subtstanial and the quality is amazing from one that has always had uniden cordless phones this is a substantial upgrade ||| 1

i 'm very pleased with this camera i updated it with the new drivers and software on the creative site from january 2006 immediately and i have not had any of the problems others mention the image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true usb 2.0 camera it will work with usb 1 but be sure you use usb 2.0 for better quality video calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement but for basic conversations it is fine i use 8 mbs cable and i connect with people using the same or high speed dsl this camera takes great video photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you if you want to take a large group shot it is really cool the other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well i do n't use the face tracking the base deserves a mention too i use this on my notebook and on my desktop it 's cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate amazon is offering ||| 1
i wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days the mouse is very good a tad small but still very comfortable not as good as mx tm 500 for my hand i 'd say i have a medium size hand but still a very solid product side buttons are very useful no need to install any additional drivers for xp if you are ok with the default behavior just plug it in and use the keyboard is it is not bad but just not very comfortable especially compared to microsoft keyboards i use microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines the labeling is very small keys are not standard and i hate vista ready button if you hit it in the middle of the game you are lucky not to crash would i buy it again yes would i recommend it yes but with some reservations ||| 1

like most people here i found the bose triport headphones to have excellent sound but the plastic on mine also broke in the recess next to the earcups what i found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic in fact the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended my recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic bose replaced them with no hassles no receipt no registration just sent them back and got a brand new pair i think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago ||| 1
i recently received the zen microphoto as a gift since i travel fairly often i decided to purchase the traveldock after reading the reviews it 's great the microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply the sound is rich loud enough and better than any other travel speakers that i own many people comment on the bass issue for travel speakers the traveldock has the best bass to date in my opinion true bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer for an additional 60 from creative 's website i 'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience the jacks are easy to reach and use which are on the back of the unit also the microphoto charges while docked whether it 's playing or not there 's even an attachable fm antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also by the way it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between fm and 's adjust volume and overall this is a very nice addition to the zen microphoto ||| 1
again creative labs has combined all you need into one package line in jack usb port fm antenna and even a jack for a ! for a small portable speaker this system gets pretty loud and clear the stereo effect button works great the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch now for the cons like most reviewers i too have to say the bass is lacking a bit and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price this speaker system is very good i tried the altec lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either right now im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great ! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano then i know the traveldock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for one more thing if your going to use the cable for a device other than the zen micro be sure to insert the black end of the cable into the device your want to play and the white end into the speakers jack i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached i did it myself and i figured it out unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review i love these speakers and i even use them for my and they sound great for that too ||| 1
i bought these speakers based on price because i just wanted to get some budget speakers to start off with on my home theater it turns out that these speakers have amazing sound quality easily rivaling speakers that cost the price i really ca n't find one bad thing to say even at high volumes they have a crystal clear pristine sound the sub woofer pumps a nice rich heavy bass take advantage of the low price on these speakers you wo n't find a better deal i 'm using these speakers with a harman kardon avr 240 receiver and i also have two polk 's as my front left and right ||| 1
nice little system but only 4 ohms so doesnt handle a lot of power good sound for an apartment ||| 1
for the cost you ca n't go wrong with these speakers from jensen we love them and in shopping around found them to be one of the best home theater values the sound is great and the speakers are perfect for just about any home theater need ||| 1
purchased this iterm for my printer pictures are outstanding and the cartridge does the problem is the cartridge gets eaten up in no time at all cost per print no bargain problem is n't with the catridge but with the printer and print process now we know why hp has printers at such reasonable price they eat you up and spit you out via the price of cartidges that 's where the real profit lies amazon is tops in price and service delivery ||| 1
about 2 years ago i finally got into the digital age i began printing my own pictures and have tried every brand of photo paper out there kodak hp store brands etc by far the most superior paper is canon they make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints great photos i did a wedding album using canon photo paper and the couple i gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they 'd hired which speaks volumes to the quality of canon paper i 'd highly recommend that people use this brand you wo n't be sorry ||| 1
echoing most other reviews here this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money but buying them is a risk ! if you do n't wear these earphones correctly they sound terrible easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones those unsatisfied with the sound quality especially those complaining of lack of bass either have n't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears learning how to put them in properly takes time be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions once you teach yourself how to put them in it will only take a few seconds some tips before inserting the earbuds draw the phones up from behind your ear holding the earbuds in the correct orientation drivers pointing medially so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals with one hand pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other this straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone your doctor uses the same maneuver when examines you with an otoscope you may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better if the phones are properly inserted they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your eustachian tubes that is swallow just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator it may seem like it takes a lot of work and possibly learning a bit about anatomy to get these earphones to work as intended it does and success is not guaranteed but it 's worth it ! and to save your hearing do n't forget to turn down the volume since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise ||| 1
this was the largest set that would fit into my space i also looked at the westinghouse 37 inch hd moniter at best buy the first time i looked at the westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy then i read the review on cnet which said the westinghouse picture was actually better than the sharp i went back to best buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the westinghouse could be improved he said it was as it good as it could be he than said the sharp was twice the price of the westinghouse so i should expect a better picture on the any event i purchased the sharp on amazon during the recent electronic express sale on hd the picture is amazing it 's also quite good on regular tv my only regret is that toshiba has just come out with a lcd with a dvd built in if i had known i would have waited to check out that model ||| 1
we bought 3 of these and every one has dead pixels it 's not a ton but one monitor has three that are red in the center of the screen and other has a few that are bright green in the corner not a huge deal but there are some in all 3 ||| 1

before i bought this product i was contemplating which brand name hard drive i should go with i was told seagate was top of the line it truly is no problems at all easy to setup and use and a fair price i highly recommend seagate over any other brand name i 've heard problems with other brands ||| 1
this is a great little piece of hardware i bought it for my 's and movies and i 'm very pleased it 's totally '' there are n't even any drivers that need updating assuming you have xp up to par it gives well 149 in actuality of space to work with after moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once on the first day it froze up after that minor incident i 've had no problems though and my machine runs alot faster because of it with my of music already on it i 'm very happy with it it has given me no fuss it does n't even give me any noise ! it 's as silent as a fart and that 's a big plus i found mine at for 114 and i think that i made a good purchase if you 're on a budget this is about as good as it gets seagate 's is also highly recommended as i 've worked with it before ||| 1
this drive is whisper quiet easy to install and use and in my experience plenty fast i recently encoded my cd collection in flac format and am using this drive to store files i also used to convert the flac files to all on this drive during the process of converting the files which is pretty i found the drive to be completely reliable and the speed to be more than adequate ||| 1
i purchased this radio to keep on my kitchen counter i chose boston acoustics over tivoli because you ca n't preset the stations in the tivoli and i like to flip through commercials other reviewers wrote that the bass can be overpowering i listen to rock music and do not notice the bass my complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly it does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house also if you are listening to the radio you ca n't see the time display this radio is great if you have limited space it looks good and sounds like a much larger radio it has a lot of power for a small radio ||| 1
excellent accessory portable and you do not have to apply anything permanent to your vehicle recommended ||| 1

i own a set of older martin logan speakers their quality is legendary with a price to match so i was interested in maximizing performance when i called their office for advice one of the tech guys excellent service by the way told me the monster banana plugs were great not the best or most expensive available but a good value that was enough for me my speakers are so i purchased two sets of four plugs installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful add to that the free shipping no tax and a total price saving of 12.00 and you ca n't do better than amazon ! ||| 1

this is an awesome little player i enjoy both the player and the fm radio it is very easy to use and syncs well with windows media player it is perfect for going to the gym because it is so small it came with a great leather case that fits it well and prevents damage and scratches my only problem with the player is that i ca n't fit more than songs although it says there is about of space left on the player ||| 1
i 've been using this router for a few days i just had to set it up i have n't had any cause to touch it since it 's very reliable highly recommended ||| 1
unit works about as expected with possible exception of a few areas of the screen that are not too sensitive to the touches from the stylus so far i am working around that this is my deluxe and the one to give any operational problem of any sort generally a good product ||| 1
yeah so apparently this was a really good pda to buy i bought this three years ago and it still works ! ive been searching for a new pda since i thought this one was so out of date and when reading all the reviews i came across many new state of the art '' pdas that broke after only a few months this baby has been great to me for three long years so if you are looking for a reliable buy go for this definately not flashy very basic all i use it for is appointments dates and great for students who want to use a pda as an agenda ! good luck on your pda search ! ||| 1
i am working with my new pda the live drive and is great to have akk ny videos music and to write my notes and documents before my shift or meeting and also the wireless connection is so great i like the option that you can use it as an external drive ||| 1
i am extremely happy with this purchase and will most likely purchase another one of these soon ||| 1
netgear clearly has not figured out how to make their rangemax adapter work well with the microsoft xp operating system if you 're not a techie i 'd stay away until microsoft has certified the here 's what i experienced 1. installed using the netgear automated configuration 2. after installation completion and boot up cpu utilization was at a solid 100 executable from netgear named taking up a bunch of the cpu and microsoft routines and taking the rest 3. emailed netgear and received response to use task manager to delete did so for all users 4. hey ! cpu utilization returned to normal ! 5. sent next email to netgear pointing out that this solution is just a patch '' and would return when i 6. received response to and software for 7. did so but then netgear adapter software could not find my mimo wireless router ! and usage of the netgear adapter software does n't allow you to use the microsoft wireless zero configurator wzc 8. went to and looked up error 871122 error message when you try to run the wireless network setup wizard '' and followed the instruction to allow usage of wzc 9. then able to add my wireless router and everything is the functionality works great it 's the getting there that 's not too pretty good ||| 1

i 'm using the monster cable mp home theater powercenter to remove line noise in the electrical current to a tube the line noise is removed beautifully however the powercenter itself creates a tone the tone comes out of the powercenter device directly if you are planning to use this product on a sound system i recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated ||| 1
for the background i 've owned used various iem headphones over the years ety altec lansing shure sony koss here 's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week pros 1. very good bass well balance not as bloated as the sony the has tight but the least is good treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box but can be tamed with eq 2. easy to drive with the phones i 'd need to crank up the vol 3. very light weight 4. comfortable tips 3 sizes included 5. decent isolation from outside noise the have better isolation 6. moderately priced 50 cons 1. cables are thin so handle with care 2. some people may not like the phonendoscope effect '' cables frictions this is very common with iem headphones some are more than others 3. no pouch or case ps for you will like these iems from an owner of beyer 's experience ||| 1
all headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something sound travels along wires it 's physics there 's nothing you can do about that now these earphones are incredibly and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires these headphones are called asymmetric '' meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left you wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud behind your neck this leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands this also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food does n't spill on the wire i paid about 60 bucks and for that price i love these headphones face it these are low to in terms of price but perform more like to high range if you ask me the cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage the buds are comfy and i like the asymmetric design people need to realize that there are premium headphones for 500 or more i think people need to keep perspective and not have too high expectations from only a 60 pair ||| 1
this is the spindle i 've ordered and i have n't had a problem with any of my dvds ||| 1

i love the new nanos i do n't think i have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio it is small and very thin you barely feel it in your pocket which might annoy some people but not me i 'd rather get this than any zen products or sandisk sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner the screen is really bright with the full color display the new earbuds are a lot more comfortable than the old ones the new ones are n't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out i do n't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me ! the new color coating is scratch resistant but not the click wheel and the apple symbol but you do n't notice the scratches on the white parts the longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano 24 hours ! the new 4 gb color nanos are the same price as the 2 gb of the gen nanos i 'm so happy i waited after the gen nanos came out i would never get the gen nanos now since they scratch easily have a dark screen and have a short battery life the new nanos are great deals and great gifts i recommend this player to anyone that wants a good reliable scratch resistant cool looking music player ! star ||| 1
i am satisfied works great with my phone nokia ||| 1

i thought i 'd weigh in as the reviews suggesting noncompliance with apple products seemed ominous i bought a passport and the usb outlet on my macbook powers it perfectly well i do n't need an external power supply btw i get a transfer rate of about 2 or 1 minutes this seems a little slow but it does n't bother me much the passport is small has a nice rubber coating to prevent shock and overall is worth the purchase price ||| 1
these verbatim discs have the datalife plus layer of protection that will allow them to last years i 'm a professional photographer and it 's crucial to store my client 's digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come i 've tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data read errors many times but so far with the hundreds of verbatim discs i 've burned so far i have n't had a problem yet the kodak brand discs were also excellent but kodak discontinued making them sony also makes a good disc these discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the epson and the surface area is printable right up to the hub ! i have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as verbatim continues to make a great disc ||| 1
these verbatims are terrific as you may know working with media is almost a gamble cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players sticking to name brands helps but even then some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one may be good the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else usually you 're safe with media made in japan these verbatim 's are made in taiwan but they are 've bought one every couple months and i 'm on my spindle now they have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned dries nearly instantly in epson printers i use an hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos not one coaster so far burned with apple powerbook superdrive as well as a lacie firewire writer though the media is it works in my panasonic dvd recorder which recommends up to media perfectly so far i have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs samsung sanyo panasonic sony apex toshiba dvd players xbox no problems over 134 discs so far and they look great play great and are a great price for hub printable discs highly recommended i 'm ordering more ! ||| 1
notebooks pro is the highest rated webcam for notebooks on the market and for good reason audio and video quality is excellent you can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem the echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams especially with the use of video on the negative side the usb cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop also i have the quickcam fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall logitech ships that product with quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to quickcam 9 the notebook pro uses unfortunately logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues b ||| 1
i had the previous version also it is so far the best webcam i ever owned do n't even bother to compare it with cheap creative ones the frame rate and picture quality is awesome works in very low light conditions and has great software which can even make gieco or alien out of you they keep on working for years my old one quickcam for notebooks pro '' still a champion after use of 3 years now i got bored and gave it to my uncle and boy he loves it too newer one as mentioned by other reviewers holds much better do i sound like a logitech sales person well i must admit that i am very happy with their webcams amazon offers get price and you should get it one more thing it 's features outweighs its small size SMILE my parents back in other part of world can see even tiny things in my room which they should n't SMILE ||| 1
i got this mouse because i have developed carpel tunnel pain in my shoulder from years and years of mouse activity i 'm happy to say it is nearly gone the pain i ordered one for my office and will now get one for home it does take a bit of getting used to after years of movable mouse action but it can be done good luck ||| 1
unlike many other cables that splice output this cable does so while retaining the details of that output both left and right channels are extracted and outputted not simply the left channel with audio mixed down to mono also it works on some computers too ! on the minus side i have n't gotten it to work on the television in order to do so you also have to buy the adapter for the creative zen player i bought this so my creative sleek photo would be compatible with an chair with built in speakers and found that cd players and many other audio units became compatible too for that it was worth the cost ||| 1
i am running the radioshark on a powerbook mac os x i am very happy with the programmed recording saves to a variety of formats etc very handy ! the unit did all that it promised but it could have had much better software a dashboard widget is also included that controls basic operation but not recording or eq needed additions 1. station presets are selected from a drop down menu ! one has to go to the rs menu bar top of screen to find the favorite stations kind of klunky better to have radio buttons '' associated with the app window to be fair the widget does have better station selection but the button is labeled with a 'heart ' 2. no station scan '' function one has to dink through the entire spectrum manually wow hard to understand this lack of functionality 3. some additional audio functions could be included there is a eq that works well mostly see comment below at minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect also one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file though for mac os x there is a nice freeware app that can do this audacity oddities 1. when first installed the output had static in it which was worse with the eq on griffin tech support was not very helpful as with most tech support offerings they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions software and it began working well 2. initially did not seem to work well thru an external powered hub now has no problems though unit does work okay with a usb extension cable ||| 1
this is a total bargain not only was the price right it works perfectly in the car at home converting every radio to a stereo system for my ipod nano when they 're put together it looks like one unit and if by chance you use a motorola rzr phone the charger works with he itrip and recharges the nano eliminating the need for any other charger devices ||| 1

i have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new ipod all i wanted was decent sound for a decent price but after trying various models of and standard phones and returning them all i figured i was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all but then i decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be the only choice for koss of course ! and they still have it these are n't the greatest phones i 've ever heard but for 20 and it seems you can now get them for half that ! they easily compare to some sets costing 3 times as much or more finally no awful peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer cough sony they are fairly i think i would rather have the traditional band but you get used to these pretty quick these sound nice the bass does n't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it 's smooth and most important you can listen for hours without ear fatigue without a doubt these are the best budget phones i 've ever owned ! my bottom anyone who does n't grab these for 10 bucks a pop is insane period ||| 1
i 've tried several different brands of headsets and this one wins it reduces noise has excellent sound and is comfortable for hours at a time my office is between the shop where we make rocket engines and the flight line on the airport where airplanes are tested sometimes jet aircraft sit outside my window and perform engine or idle the apu for hours this headset reduces the white noise while still allowing me to hear the phone ring even when a local phantom ii tests the afterburner ||| 1

i 've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase i 've used them for hooking up my gaming systems tv cable box and player note i had to buy a small 3 in 1 fiber optic switch box to handle all these cables receiver and tv only had one digital audio connection each i believe that these cables are the best name brand values currently around for fiber optic audio what do you really get for a high end '' fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable i do n't know i purchased one which was top of the line '' and obscenely expensive and of course it sounds great but these cables sound great too plus these cables are monster cables and they are thx certified ! what does thx certification mean below is a blurb taken directly from the thx website describing it '' thx is on the forefront of entertainment technology offering products and services of unparalleled quality for distribution and playback of audio and visual content thx certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance '' a digital signal is a digital signal this is fiber optic cable uses light to transmit the digital data does n't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable so these cables are not likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables they just are going be a little less durable and probably use slightly less high quality materials are they fragile not at all but the top of the line cable that i purchased was so thick that i probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine this thx cable is thinner and i could imagine it breaking more easily if you work somewhere like a studio where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly a lot of and bending of the ends overall i 'm very happy with these cables and can i afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections i am now using receiver tv cable box for first time users do n't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables these are there to protect the cable during and will prevent the light from passing unless removed throw these tips away you 'll never need them again ||| 1
i have had this phone now about 3 months and i am very happy with it it has all the things and want and many more the hand sets are very clear and i love the fact i can check voice mail on any hand set that goes with it i do not have to run to the main answering machine to check the voice mail the range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this so far i love everything with this phone it is much better than either of the last two phone i have had i have walked over a block from the house and it still works clearly i have never had a phone that worked so far away from home ||| 1
i purchased the notebook cooler approximately one month ago after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating thankfully the same time i read that circuit city was having a sale on this item for only 15 after rebate fast forward one month and my opinion of the cooler so far not bad my laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now and the internal fan rarely comes on the notebook cooler itself is smartly designed with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat i 'll admit the usb connector cable is a bit flimsy and i can see why some folks have complained for those users who travel frequently or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often you may want to exercise extra caution the blue led light that some reviewer claims is too strong '' is a minor quibble if you really wanted to you could always tape over the light and problem solved as for the fan noise i would say the low setting is comparable to white noise '' which you do n't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it ! the high setting on the other hand is a bit loud and i can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or tv to compensate usually though i only use the high setting when it 's really hot in the room or if i 'm running intensive programs like photoshop or some video game overall i 'd say i 'm very satisfied with this product though i am somewhat disappointed that antec needs 3 months to process my 15 rebate check ||| 1
the logitech mx 400 mouse in my opinion was a good buy it is very reliable accurate scrolls smooth and is precise and responsive on every surface i have used it on it is also light weight and comfortable making it the purfect mouse for the price ||| 1
i bought two pairs of these when i saw them in a store on sale for under 15 each they 've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years the cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that i suppose imitates leather in looks and feel this outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs which makes it look raggedy but the comfort and sound quality is n't affected by it so i do n't consider it a big deal the headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it should '' but likewise it 's something to be expected with this much use and has n't affected comfort the cable is also thicker than most headphone cables i 'm used to which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such i 've compared the sound quality to the koss 's which i own and a library 's koss 's or 15 's ca n't remember which though the 's do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on the 's are the most comfortable of the three have the richest bass are the most durable and wo n't eat up your aaa batteries like the ||| 1

what a relief to find this mouse after having bought a microsoft 6000 lazer mouse which caused my tendonitis to flare up again really bad i had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another microsoft ergonomic '' mouse a year ago which became chronic but barely noticeable until i tried the 6000. i also tried a logitech which is a good mouse just not nearly as comfortable as the 450. the buttons on both of these logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless this was not so on the ms 6000. if you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook the logitech is it my hands are fairly large and for the 15 more than the it is definitely worth it as i spend a lot of time on computers ||| 1
this laser version tracks much better on odd surfaces compared to the logitech i have the setpoint software allows you to use setpoint 's mouse sensativity independent of the touchpad settings finally ! ! ! i dont have to change mouse sensativities when i unplug it the setpoint sensativity is an offset to window 's sensativity setting for the touchpad so basically set your touchpad sensativity first then adjust the setpoint sensativity they will be work just the way you want everytime you the mouse and going back and forth between touchpad and mouse perfect product ||| 1

this is a product too unique for me not too try i 've struggling with lost receipts and always in a panic mode when tax day comes there 's just no other easy way i 've found to keep track of all my receipts even with some of the negativity about the accuracy on the receipt recognition i still wanted to try this out for myself i noticed the following will increase the accuracy of the receipt scanning 1 scan your receipt asap once you have it receipts are pretty cheap in quality and will fade over time also for that matter you risk the chance of loosing the receipt the longer you do n't scan it in SMILE 2 ink quality on the receipt matters it does the best job when the dots of the are together and dark 3 wording on the receipt the receipt can say then scanner will pick it as visa business card scans have been excellent for me be sure to upgrade your sw to the lastest version mine is 2.55 at the time of writing ||| 1

excellent antenna why pay so much more for other indoor antennas such as terk or samsung i tried both of those but ended up with the zenith at a fraction of the price and with much better reception ||| 1
i live in manhattan on the floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception i use it hooked up to an hp 3200 lcd tv with tuner it took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception the cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light i have it resting atop my center channel speaker 20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks especially for football ||| 1
this is very comfortable and works very well it 's heavy enough that it does n't move around or push the keyboard as some of the other types of wrist rests that i 've used have done yet it 's cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support ||| 1
i type medical reports for a living up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week without the wrist rest my wrists would not be able to hold up the wrist rest is the perfect size it stays in place on the desk the gel continues to be supportive even after a year of working on it the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell i ca n't smell it while typing only when i pick it up for cleaning i wish there was the option for half stars i 'd give this stars ||| 1

this uniden system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago here 's a list of the other things about this phone that i like most 1. the corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off this along with price was the main reason i bought this phone system this feature is unusual for a cordless phone system 2. the controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you do n't have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording 3. also the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far 4. the battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges at least a week sometimes more 5. voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good however there is something about this phone system that i do n't like the cordless handset has a pretty limited range i had to locate the base unit in a central location in my square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms but overall i think the phone is a good buy if you can live with the distance restrictions of the cordless handset ||| 1
very effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone i have sound is ok for what it does however in a moving vehicle it actually distorts the music which is a surprise my other headphone does not do that it appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite wave by the time the opposite wave applies to the music the intruding noise is over otherwise no complains ||| 1
i was debating over the picturemate kodak printer dock 3 sony and the hp photosmart 475. i made the choice of the hp and i love it ! the prints are and look like real lab prints i use the hp boarderless premium plus photo paper with the hp ink and the prints are just wonderful forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all the hp produces bright vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime the picturemate is also alot larger than the hp 475. the hard drive is a plus as well hp said that the remote is not included but they lied they come with the remote and battery overall this printer is the best i have own ||| 1
these dvds are absolutely top quality and you really need to use bad dvds to know how bad they can get i ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far not a single coaster and nero data verification i always do that for dvds has not brought up any errors ever btw the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files the burner is the dvd multi drive on my dell inspiron laptop 1505 however i should mention to those who have n't bought this product why they are called shiny silver you know that print on the top of dvds with lines and that matte finish well there 's no such thing on these dvds the top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side other than the characteristic dvd color anyone who has seen unbranded dvds will know exactly what i 'm talking no special surface however a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks huge cost cutting here i guess but definitely not in the quality department i will buy again ||| 1
i burn a ton of dvds and have used almost every brand out there many have errors even the top brand names like memorex etc i have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting i 've switched all dvd media purchases to verbatim they are by far the best of them all would recommend to everyone ||| 1
first off these puppies sound good ! however there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know the sound is loud and crisp but definetely as with most headphones the low end is there but for full effect it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves this sweet spot is not very wide that said however i recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small most systems utilize either massive woofers or chambered enclosures or both to deliver since the size of this type of headphones does n't permit for either big speakers or special chambers maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber ! i am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard for the price they better be so if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback look into buying those pricey phones the lack of such bass is the only reason i did n't give it five stars also the lack of colored left blue or white right red tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time i did n't realize i had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable i just had to check so be careful riding while using them can be dangerous since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead bang for the buck i paid 69.99 on amazon i really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados ||| 1

i had slight confusion whether to choose the sony 64 mb memory stick which is nearly the same price or this one which has twice the memory capacity of the previous one i choose this one for the better deal and to add to my surprise j r electronics shipped it so quickly you guys rock ! ! ! this one comes par with sony memory media in every field so why choose the one with lesser memory capacity choose this one and feed your camera with some memory space ||| 1
delivered on time no problems setting it up just followed the instructions to format it because i did n't want the default format it comes with which is less safe it 's been running fine ever since i bought it i ca n't comment on the speed of access because since i leave it backing up over night i do n't really care it 's all done in the morning anyway so i do n't really need anything faster ||| 1
i like this unit it is hooked up to an in from my digital cable box and uses a component video out to a mitsubishi hdtv picture quality is very good i 'm very used to my sony dvd player but this one is very close there is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the cable box but then i 've not compared with other units i think its more than acceptable a dvd i burned played fine on the when i recorded one program deleted it and then recorded again it would only play on an older sony dvd player my sony dvd player is kind of touchy anyhow all told i 'd recommend this dvd recorder without hesitation ||| 1
i do n't normally write reviews on products but in this case i feel i must share the value and features of this product you ca n't go wrong in selecting this for your dvd needs the quick start guide is just that quick '' and well planned the people at samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best i have seen well documented with pictures in full color and just that for the novice the setup diagram is excellent the features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize any disc and away you go one touch record starts immediately the quality is superb especially in high definition i could n't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last electronics trade show so i was able to get it from back east about three weeks ago finalizing discs is a snap and easy i have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the samsung is so easy the menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers ! it will play cds computer made divx movies region 1 dvds picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly you can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer 's codes which they list in a handy guide if you are shopping for a multi search no more get this one you wo n't be disappointed ||| 1
i bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk i was totally wrong ! ! ! these are great they give the bass right where you want it sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much watch out these come on sale instores for around 8.00 sometimes that 's where i got my pair ||| 1
the sound range and clarity is quite good they are comfortable my only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes i 'd like to use it with my computer not a attached to my belt ||| 1
i got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued which in my opinion was a big mistake on apple 's part and i absolutely love it ! mine is pink and the color is so nice the design sleek and seamless all around it 's smooth metal casing is really nice and different the clickwheel is smooth and i have had no problems with it it holds a little less than songs due to different formatting but it 's still a good amount itunes is easily understandable and functional as well the ipod mini is approx of an inch think and slides into pockets easily while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me the clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs raher than as on my brother 's player needing to press next '' everytime you change the song the backlight is fine and does it 's job my one complaint on that would be that as i mainly use it on the bus at am it is quite bright and hurts my eyes another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod family '' is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them i myself have a case an iskin which i have come to adore high quality headphones and the ibass which is another great speaker product for ipods i 've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself but that 's how much i love it ! for having so many great features this is priced very reasonably even when i got it and it was 200 i still felt that it was well worth the money buy this now ! ! ! ! it 's amazing ! ||| 1
i have n't written any reviews for amazon before but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball i had to respond i 've been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90 's when kensington first came out with the turbo mouse '' it was great then and now it 's better this is as solid smooth and precise of an input device as you can get i do n't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk this baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down you can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand your choice the optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance the only drawback is the 100 retail price but frankly it 's worth that it 's a no brainer at 80 which is what i paid through amazon to tiger direct if you need or want a high performance trackball that you 'll be able to use with many computers to come get this one ||| 1
these speakers are awesome for the price they charge your ipod even when the unit is off the sound quality is great for around 50 bucks i bought these for traveling and they are small enough to fit in a suitcase without taking up too much room they also stack so they do n't take up much counter space i ca n't say enough about the sound quality they are great ||| 1
i work for a small sized consulting engineer 's firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text magazine articles old projects letters from the client books etc we got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner still working and we have been impressed with its speed small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality pdf files a couple of years we moved to the scansnap series we now have four of them pros incredibly easy to use you do n't need to teach anybody fast for pdf scanning great value for money includes acrobat 7.0 bundled very small perfect for a desk good construction quality no one of our 4 scanners ever broke cons quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional if you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams that some time occurs not great quality for photographs scanning however difficult because it is not flatbed i strongly suggest it for sized businesses to scan documents if you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better ||| 1
the cd sound is like being at the concert hooking the radio up to a television makes the home theater experience even better the fm radio receiption is even clear great quality product worth the money ||| 1
these are some great headphones with a few minor flaws pros 1. great sound quality 2. very comfortable 3. light 4. charging cons 1. achieving good wireless connection is not always easy could require pressing the button several times 2. interference noises could sneak into the broadcast 3. turning them off could be annoying requires precise timing my experience i 've had two pairs of these for over a year and i like them very much i enjoy great sound watching tv or listening to music while everybody is asleep this is really great i can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night the sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the tv you have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the tv closet or the garage for example the headphones are light and very comfortable i tried other brands and the were the most comfortable by far so overall wonderful product however there a few flaws to be aware of consider the following before buying it might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel sometimes turning the headphones on results in poor reception if any at all to correct this you have to press the only button power search and turn off and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel you might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying once you get good reception everything is ok although you might get some interference alien noises when you turn your head or move around the last problem is with the turn off button again the only multifunction button you need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit that is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on you think you turned it off but it is still on and if it 's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely well i hope my description is helpful regardless of the flaws i recommend the i use them every day and best of all i enjoy great sound when other people are asleep ||| 1
i have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set a midiland 5.1 system was thoroughly aged and falling apart i decided it was time to upgrade i wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd 's i shopped around and came to the conclusion i would aim for the form factor speakers when considering this bose system this must be taken into account first off this system is expensive for just under 1000 dollars does n't 999 sound sooo much better than you get 5 midrange speakers the subwoofer unit and speaker cable at this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize choice to suit any personal needs budget bose includes 3 colors white silver black and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not what brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness for their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any they are paired with a competent receiver anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store once i got the system home it was very easy to set up and install bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system the only serious issue i have with this system ended up being with my receiver an onkyo and not related at all with the speakers since i do run this through my computer presently a laptop i had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver but when that was all said and done i was extremely please with the system with a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges my test soundtracks included gladiator matrix ii or iii snatch and music tracks ranging from techno rock classical and alternative everything sounded great with enough low high and midrange response the second complaint i have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites i found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers were n't drowning out the voices that was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there all in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs though draining my bank account and providing me with great surround sound good great range and volume of sound easy well built and physically no interference or feedback bad subwoofer awkward no dedicated center channel pricey no included receiver for their size these speakers more than compete with any tower 5.1 system here is one satisfied customer ||| 1
ladies and gentlemen just a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy 'toys ' before exploring what it is that they 're buying i have seen people knock the sandisk drives as well as drive made by other companies well the reality is that the software has a way of stopping the software 's there is uninstall software available at at and at and i 'm guessing that those company 's that offer and have a web site probably have the 'uninstaller ' on their site there is a great deal of software available free and at i know that sandisk has a software site so do verbatim memorex for those who want portable software but do n't want or do n't have a drive go to http note some of the software here is the same used by the folks without using the launchpad quality of drives remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys ' available today you are buying chinese junk both the manufacturing and quality control qc are garbage unless you are paying serious change for something you will get passable junk if you are expecting made in japan quality '' your kidding yourself this is the reason you will see many brand name goods also selling with labels coby same production line different labels it is also one of the reason folks are impressed with apple ipods apple demands excellent qc and the destruction of goods that do n't meet the standard in exchange you are willing to pay a 20 premium for this level of qc like everything in life ya gets whats ya pay for since the beginning of windows et al there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs there will always be pain in the software one of the reasons xp has such a prominent ' feature and also the reason many if not most power users run multiple machines of course these days we have to fill billy g 's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of xp most of my friends run at least three or four machines each one with a different use it should n't be this way but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software for many purposes 's scanning video controlling radios composing music et al one machine wo n't cut it because xp ai n't as stable as folks think the more programs and the more varied in type the more instability is introduced into any windows installation why do you think businesses run or because there are less software 'toys ' that run under and the 'admin ' can prevent you from loading a lot of software 'toys ' in the end understand what you are buying before you buy so that you 'll have better luck getting what you want and you wo n't look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site s knows is dead wrong or just plain stupid when you truly understand the product you 'll be able to write truly useful reviews and that what all readers want useful information to one and all may your 'toys ' keep you happy ||| 1
very easy to use expend my wireless network access from two marginal to five with very good signal level no external power required highly recomend it ||| 1
could not have been easier to install literally just put the included cd in the drive and plug the device into your usb 2.0 port installed and in minutes very small light no additional power cords to worry about no additional software beyond the automatically installed drivers to install quick and easy only issue i found is that the antenna is permanent so you could never swap for antenna like you can on some other wireless nics ||| 1
this cover is very durable however it is somewhat difficult to get the ipod into the case the case covers the entire ipod except for small vent holes so it is very water resistant but the case covers the locking button making it harder to lock and unlock the ipod ||| 1
i purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house to start i bought only one additional phone i 'll buy the rest later so far i am very pleased the sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that i have found very useful like the talking caller id and being able to screen messages from any of the phones i also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering download a single entry or the entire list to the other phones and each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom you can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room so you would page the living rm '' rather than phone 3 etc if you have caller id you can program special rings and special call id colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone it does n't transfer when you download the directory to the other phones also on another panasonic wireless phone that i own the incoming call displayed the name i had programmed into the phone directory just like your cell phone will say home '' etc on this phone the caller id displays the telephone company info only i think the phone is great i just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature ||| 1

i am a camcorder buff ever since my children were born i have had the camcorder attached to my hand most days because i know that life is fleeting and memories are too precious to be lost i had a huge collection of video tapes and was able to transfer the entire collection to dvd now i know that they will last at least through my life also i find that using the showbiz application i can create customized dvds for my friends and that has saved me a ton of money in the only problem we had with this product was that we had limited hard disk memory and had to acquire some more and i have probably created more than a 100 dvds by now thanks hp ! ||| 1
this little device is a great invention from hp i had problems installing the unit and was on the telephone with hp tech support india for 1.75 hours i spent very little time on hold the largest draw back to the unit is my computer acts like the is not there from time to time and required me to reboot the computer in order to use this nifty device ||| 1
i recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at ebay 2 pairs of jbl and 1 pair an center speaker and a harmon kardon avr i got the first pair of a week ago and the pair of and the yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend the and are listed as bookshelf speakers '' the are bookshelf speakers as i wrote in my review of the the can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is kong and your first name is king ! the are heavy at each not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are the are heavy heavy ! 16 lbs each that is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs ! they are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep they need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor i am very pleased with both the and for small speakers the have some oomph and can be cranked up the have ooommphhhh they want to be cranked up yesterday i tried them out by listening to my files of the animals singles and paul revere and the raiders kicks when cranked up the sound at least 1000 better than the the i hooked them up to my vintage jvc av receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power at a little over half volume my ears began to hurt you can really feel the bass and the drums kick i also listened to about 2 hours of the doors via rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver i have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the the are simply incredible ! they brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh my biggest surprise with the is that they sound very good at lower volumes not as good as the but still very good as i write i am to a dvd of vivaldi 's 4 seasons concertos performed by herbert von karajan the bpo and mutter on fiddle and am running the and at about 15 volume pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver yet i can still hear everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels i am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums i bought the for under 90 including back in the early or late i spent more than four times this amount adjusted for inflation for 2 large heavy advent loudspeakers with 8 '' woofers the clearly sound better than i ever remember the advents sounding including better bass response and i liked the advents ! over time our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper you still can spend mega bucks and buy a mcintosh system or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as i saw at one website ! it all depends on what your budget is the jbls are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded ||| 1

noel lee 's monster cable products come up with the goods here ! a cable of stunning high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you 'll think you 're watching scenes through a glass window and not through a a bold claim indeed but quite true i was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better this cable brings to the viewer all the picture and yes that does mean warts and all '' so be prepared to see the smallest of detail like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work '' who really needs hdtv when cables like monster 's are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing for only a minute fraction of the cost thanks noel well done ||| 1

i have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure imo you can not beat the sound of a set of '' headphones i have tried all styles earbuds behind the neck clips even the ear plugs nothing gives the sound and comfort of the ktx pros granted i have never tried the sportapros or portapros but from what i have read they are the same headphone except they are ugly ! the ktx pros have both great lows and great highs plus you ca n't beat that price ||| 1
this is an affordable option that provides a lot of memory and allows usb 2.0 protocol for very fast transfer if you need to transfer data from one digital product to another this is very handy and i think that every person dealing a lot with data should have one ||| 1
i basically bought these because they were cheap cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example the provides excellent sound for both music and movies it has excellent bass and sound isolation i am by no means an audiophile but i know good sound when i hear it and these headphones produce great sound especially for its price ||| 1

i 've had this keyboard a number of years and would never go back to anything else i have or had severe carpal tunnel syndrom this keyboard has eliminated that problem entirely i ca n't think of a downside yes it takes a bit of getting used to and yes the keys are a bit noisy but i have no problem with that it just reminds me i 'm working the number pad is excellent too i 'm getting ready to get another one to use with my laptop you ca n't destroy this keyboard if you value your wrists and hands get this ||| 1

corded phones with features are becoming harder to find my home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages mobile phone down for whatever reason etc this is one of the few corded phones with caller id and no answering machine built in the greatest feature of this phone is it has a hold button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless etc also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house ||| 1

i 'm going to cover compatiblity sound and comfort overview although i wish these were as cheap as the ipod 39 6 shipping isnt bad either i have done the heat treatment using boiling water and the headphones seemed to open up more when the headphones came in the box the ear pieces were really close together so i can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head i plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more sound sound quality is excellent comfort the only thing i do n't really like is this style of headphone i do n't really like the band to go around the back of my head causing my ears to support the headphones i like the ones that go over the top of your head compatibility i have a inspiron dell laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter these can also connect to just about any player of all sizes psp also because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord features coolest features with this compared to my other ir sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls ! about feet away ||| 1
i am overall quite pleased with these headphones the sound quality is excellent i 've not had any problems with interference background hiss or anything of that nature battery life has been excellent i have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they 'll last but i use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they have n't failed me yet the only reason i would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use i 'm not really a big fan of this sport '' style of headphone and probably would n't have tried these if i had n't gotten them on clearance but i found that after experimenting a little i was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable even wearing them the better part of a workday ||| 1
the keyboard is good quality and the best product i could find for the price i recommend if you are looking for a low profile keyboard entry pad that takes a mimimum anount of desk space the keypad has the feel of a large notebook computer so makes a great docking station keyboard if you are used to the slim kepads on most modern laptop computers ||| 1
first off let me say that this is a very impressive monitor my points of reference for that statement are my other three lcd monitors three samsung models two of which are and the other is a these two samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this viewsonic and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this viewsonic surprisingly i actually can see the brightness difference between the samsungs and this viewsonic but for my taste and needs the samsungs are simply too bright and i end up turning down their brightnesses anyway for high light daytime use i have found that i do like to have the brightness all the way up on the viewsonic but i truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being installation was simple in fact something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that interestingly again the drivers that are on the viewsonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation cd even though the driver package that is posted on the viewsonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago when i first installed this monitor and turned it on i truly do not think the picture was as clear or the graphics as rich as any of the samsung monitors that i own but and this is another tip for new users of this product the default setting for the viewsonic screen contrast was set much lower than the maximum setting when i increased the contrast up to its maximum setting i believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal if not fully equal to those on the other lcds that i own one big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a dvi cable included so you save that added expense this is n't true with all viewsonics and especially with the digital connection i have no doubts about viewsonic 's claim that this monitor has nearly twice versus the refresh rate as the samsungs i have to admit that i was n't sure i needed a widescreen display but i believe it 's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones ! this is a really a fine monitor ! now for a few small negatives one reason i have n't purchased viewsonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers i already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer so i really have no use for monitor speakers additionally those viewsonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than i 'm comfortable with strains my neck the reason i really did n't worry about it on this monitor was because while there are speakers they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other viewsonic monitors with that said i have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than i had expected for example on the 17 inch samsung monitor the bottom of the screen is 3 '' from the desktop on the 19 inch samsungs it is 4 inches on this viewsonic the bottom of the screen is 5 inches above the desktop it 's not bad but it 's going to take a bit of getting used to if all else fails other monitor stands are available as with most electronic products these days there is very little in the way of documentation the 87 billion language installation card tells diddly the manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard things however i found the interactive help program on the manufacturer 's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems surprisingly all in all i 'm very impressed so far and i 'm really looking forward to using this monitor ! by the by shipping from was amazingly fast it shipped the next day and it arrived the day after that i ca n't complain about that speed ! my only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free go figure ! anyway a solid four stars for this monitor ||| 1
i 'm using this ap along with a netgear pc card to test streaming tv to other parts of my house seems like a capable product even if i did n't use the feature however be sure to update the firmware or the ap might not work correctly when i first received it configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my netgear and hp centrino notebook both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an ip address from my network 's dns server a firmware upgrade solved the problem and the ap now streams tv realibly from my living room to the kitchen i noticed that there is are hordes of wireless aps around my house i guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well however this ap is able to function correctly abeit all the other aps around 2 using the same channel as mine i 've found overall recommended if you want a good ap just be sure to update the firmware ||| 1
the sound quality is pretty darn good except that if you pace around while there are these annoying sounds they are quite and if you stand still they go away i 've had other phones that while pacing around and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking at least this phone does n't do that my 900 mhz dss uniden did n't have these sounds while pacing or otherwise and still had greater range i do n't know why the new technology ca n't measure up still though this is the best 5.8 i 've tried yet i 'd rather buy another dss if there were any on the market anymore all of today 's are analog instead of digital another annoying thing is that you ca n't recharge the phone with the belt clip attached so the clip goes on and off and on and off many cell phones have a charger that allows this the plastic is a bit cheap do n't drop this phone my friend has one and it has n't worked since it was dropped i have n't tried the bluetooth yet and have yet to see how good the battery life is ||| 1
i got this base and added 6 handsets to it the whole setup works great i got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone that features works well there 's a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that 's trivial i will say this you need to keep your cell phone within about 20 ' of this base i just take mine off turn on bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base so if you want the cell dialing feature and like the more traditional upright handset get this base and expand it with other handsets ||| 1

researched a lot before i bought this tv and for the money this one was hands down the best 32 '' lcd also amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues i mainly use this tv for my xbox 360. you will not be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same the game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well i provides sort of an anti aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges all in all after owning the tv for about 2 months now i could n't be happier to get around the poor speakers i just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound great i 've also hooked up an hd antenna and regular cable hd channels have a very good picture over the air some football games almost look better on this than on my 42 '' samsung dlp downstairs with the hd cable there 's also a nice antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the over the air antenna the only drawbacks to the tv are the 1 component input and the fact you ca n't use the pip with the cable connected only the antenna ||| 1
i had a zen vision m but i returned it because i decided i did n't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and i wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player so i decided to go with the zen v since it 's interface is almost identical to that of the zen vision m 's which i liked the first thing you will notice is the physical design initially i was n't that impressed but it 's really grown on me the height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the ipod nano you can actually wrap your entire hand around the device and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand the second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well the music is organized your standard interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion still it 's as simple as you can get i suppose the device officially supports album art although it seems to be very in that regard in my experience the screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight the middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push a dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top the player syncs with via usb connection syncing it is a snap although i was not impressed with the transfer speeds also if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer album art will not be attached to the music tracks if you are a newbie to buying players make note of the different sized models the model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files most of my files are mid wmas and i can fit about 500 songs on the player half as much as advertised summary pros excellent physical design easy to use interface good navigation great sound quality cons playlist creation is flawed album art support slow transfer speeds from accesories rarely available in stores ultimately i recommend the zen v over the ipod nano mostly on the strength of it 's vastly superior physical design ||| 1
i have had these speakers for over a month and i love them they sound awesome they were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described ||| 1
i read the other reviews for these speakers so i had very high expectations i can only say wow ! the premium price compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems is absolutely justified ||| 1
for reference i 've owned a set of labtec 2.1 speakers for about years now with the purchase of a a new computer mac pro cinema display i decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers i spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models listening to them in stores whenever possible of the major pc speaker '' makers i recall sampling altec lansing logitech klipsch bose creative and jbl aside from listening in stores a poor environment i also took into account personal experience with the brands mostly the first three i listed in regular home '' situations i initially wanted the klipsch promedia 2.1 's because of the fantastic reviews they 've gotten on amazon and elsewhere but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality parts breaking very quickly along with reports of buzzing the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer my impression of them in stores and experience with a friend 's promedia 4.1 's which neither i nor him really cared for and which recently broke i tried as many logitech speakers as i could in many different situations and decided i hate all of them with the sole exception of the 's which i own and love ! the bass especially sucks on their speakers so through all this i eventually came to the conclusion that altec langsing was the brand i wanted to go with and if that was so it had to be the 's which i had been eyeing for years the first time i heard them in a store i declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true these are probably the best 200 2.1 pc speakers you can buy even at their msrp of 250 they 're probably worth it these speakers a very nice ! the sound is very clear and sharp get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files the speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments not techno though that sounds good too subwoofer is not boomy '' or buzzy '' like others have reported i never use the equalizer in itunes and have the bass at about half it 's very deep rich and discrete does n't shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain yes i live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine for those who complain about the bass maybe you should n't have gotten 2.1 speakers maybe your units were defective or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position i know sound is highly subjective but those reviews just do n't sound right to me pros tall sleek and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the cinema display perfectly bass and treble have a range of adjustability 50 of either is plenty enough for me power button on control pod this is important no buzzing not while they 're on not while they off 100 silent cons volume adjustment is digital and moves in notches '' these notches are n't always small enough i much prefer a regular analog knob remote is a bit useless while they look good and perform well they feel a little cheap get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor on the other hand long cables are a pro as well and finally do n't be fooled by specs yes other speakers may have more watts of power and thx certification but that really does n't matter as much as it might seem these are more than loud enough for any sane person 100 volume would probably wake up the neighborhood i really did n't pay any attention to the specs i bought them because they sound the best ||| 1
i 've owned these altec 's for over three years now and i have yet to ever coming close to replacing them as a matter of fact when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer i went ahead and still purchased these babies ! sound quality the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall i have used mine for video editing and i 'm very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through in addition to the special effects sound unless you need a five speaker system or comparable then i 'm confident that this is the most crisp sound you 'll find in any speaker volume these suckers can get loud just take my word for it compatibility this is the part i love most there is no software to install and no special plugs the speakers plug right in and very easily into the audio jack just like a pair of headphones would thus hooking in a computer ipod etc is easy as heck making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment controls the speaker system comes with a seperate remote giving one access to adjust the volume bass and treble all seperately from the computer 's controls the knob to control the volume and other functions is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments size the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size placing these speakers is easy price believe me it 's a bargain at under 200 ! ! ! overall i give my full recommendation here you 'll love these speakers ||| 1
my sound improvement was n't as dramatic as many people describe likely because i already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers but i did notice an improvement over the integrated system i have once i made some adjustments if you listen to rock pop blues or jazz this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier it also seems to improve pandora internet radio streams even more than my 's though i have to keep the volume at about in the pandora player to prevent distortion if you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo i 'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound but it might ||| 1
i wondered what kind of mouse i would get for 60 i kept thinking what could be so special about it well i do n't know where to begin i like it so much i 'm getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work i used a microsoft explorer mouse prior and thought i 'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons i needed this mouse completely puts the explorer to shame it took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but i soon caught on i really did n't care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it that 's not why i got it although it does look pretty cool as for gaming i really did n't notice much improvment in my skill but it really does feel better in your hand the bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier my only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks homemade '' i would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a pc ||| 1
i got the razor diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it 's performance for gaming it 's great but i do not recommended it for everyday mousing around the resolution on the diamondback was the selling point for me and if that 's something your interested in you will not be disappointed it 's really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit i do have a few gripes with it 's design but with that can be overlooked ! oh it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip design problems that i have noticed buttons squeak button placement is not optimal it 's kinda small for people with big hands programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement if you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse highly recommended ||| 1
i decided to upgrade my laptop with the from the i did this because the g '' card would randomly disconnect when the wep or wpa security was activated living in a home near about 6 other networks i really wanted the router and wireless network secured so i purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem i can happily say it solved the random disconnect with wpa security turned on the range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid have not had a disconnect yet over the last 5 hours the reason i took away one star is the fact on the wireless network monitor there seems to be a flaw when i connect to the network and internet the monitor says it is hooked to the network but unable to find the internet obvious by my submission of this review the internet can be found and used all in all a good product that functions just fine in my toshiba laptop phil mesa az ||| 1
this was easy to and use it receives the signal from the router in all the rooms in my house ||| 1
camera works great ! the first one i ordered did not function correctly but amazon promptly replaced it resolution is good and audio is a great bonus that works very well a great feature for me that i found was not available on all other devices was the ability to have video stored on a network folder additionally there is no software required to run this ||| 1
a device like this either works or it does n't this one happens to work ||| 1
i had no problem with the product the directions were pretty simple problem i never received my rebate information ! ! ! ||| 1
the first week i had these the left earpiece 's plastic rails '' which hold the earpiece in its slot broke the parts that seem to need the most strength structurally are fasioned with cheap plastic sound quality is great with music playing and noise cancelling active a normal conversation is barely audible in the background great for crowded offices battery life is good i 've gotten hours using a nimh rechargeable ||| 1
i ordered these headphones from amazon based primarily on user reviews of a number of noise cancelling headphones i am quite pleased with my purchase though not stellar audiophile quality the sound is pretty darn good and with some minor eq it 's excellent the noise cancelling effect seems to work very well much better than i expected furthermore the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed i highly recommend them ||| 1
i recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera canon powershot is which came with an extremely small and practically useless secure digital card so i bought a couple of these pny secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than 20 apiece these sd cards are made in japan by toshiba they are then rebranded and sold by pny lexar daneelec etc and i have been very pleased with them so far they work flawlessly with no delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound and the card reader in my hp pavilion media center pc running windows xp professional service pack 2 reads the pictures and video into my adobe photoshop elements 4.0 and premiere elements 2.0 software programs with no problems the only drawback is that the on these standard sd cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster sd cards it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full card onto my pc but i find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem so if a little longer read time is not a problem for you then save yourself some money and buy this card overall a very good standard sd card at an excellent price ! ||| 1
there is n't too much to write about this except is delivers as stated great product for the price ||| 1
i set up a small security program with my macintosh intially i needed a pc to place the settings in the camera however once i got it hooked up to my security system it works beautifully i would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you do n't you will be getting just a black fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security this camera is a very simple easy to use camera without the fuss of zooming pan tilt etc if you need a simple camera you ca n't go wrong with the wireless or wired version ||| 1
what can you say i placed my order with a few days later the product arrived at my door perfect ||| 1
the quality of materials zipper hard case strap and light weight are outstanding when i connected my player the sound was impressive for portable stereo speaker next i took the out of the speaker case and loaded my dt pocket radio again the sound was very good and even loud at a low volume setting now the minor negatives changing the volume etc requires going into the zipped case other than the ipod be careful in selecting this speaker the player radio can not be more than 4 '' high 2.5 '' wide and '' thick larger and you may not be able to zip closed the speaker case which is necessary my items just do fit so the quality sound and materials make this a fine product especially for the money other products reviews have greatly helped me decide what to buy this is why i did this review please do the same for others as you buy products ||| 1
i bought this package purely for the keyboard i wanted a new one with wireless technology and i was driven to bluetooth just because it is so reliable i do not use the keyboard and mouse together however the keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards i 've ever used i am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential the pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized the only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home end page up page down and delete keys they moved them around from the conventional way which i still have n't gotten used to but it 's fine i have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard i play a game called stepmania a sort of dance dance revolution clone for pc which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard i 've experienced no problems here it 's spot on and probably the fastest ever the only problem really is it takes a while to register if you have n't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect after that however there are no problems at all i do not use the mouse with the keyboard i decided to use it as a mouse with my ibook since it had bluetooth i had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly i do n't use the mouse very much but the times i do use it i experience no problems both the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice i can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems the battery life on the keyboard is also very nice esspecially since it has the sleep feature i have had to replace the batteries once since i got the unit in january of 06 currently june of 06 i have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet but i do not use it very much others complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the bios or startup screens but i have n't had any issues with that it depends on how recent your motherboard is and mine is relatively new so i had no problems i highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop either way you can not go wrong with this package it is extremely excellent ||| 1
i recently purchased these speakers for my patio setup the sound quality wont blow your mind but it does not sound bad its large and lound enough to hear for an outdoor speaker for the price it has a switch in the back for not really sure what that does very easy installation with the brackets included no screws provided overall great unit for thye pric ||| 1
i agree that these cables are way too expensive ! ! however that being said they really do perform well i have been using them for almost a year and they are just solid colors always look their best i know it was a silly purchase but my dvd 's look great ||| 1
overall a good phone low cost well built many features speaker works ok for the price features such as caller id and the speaker phone are powered by batteries as stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months even if you do not use the speaker phone often this phone would be a great phone for the price if it did not use batteries but was a model ||| 1
for a long time i was looking for a phone to use with skype for the price and convenience actiontec internet phone wizard was the best i found and ordered it from amazon 42.99 with free shipping after receiving the modem i have been using it for almost a month now and i am extremely happy i have connected my codeless phone to it and everything seems to be working fine ||| 1

you can never go wrong with this paper i always buy it here the price in stores is outrageous ||| 1
my experince shows that it is always better to use paper from the same brand as your printer then the result is really outstanding print after print the paper is really top quality and regardless of your needs it will satisfy them bravo canon for this first class product ||| 1
agree with the reviewer who called this a 'perfect product ' it is a take it out of box b plug it in c you 're networked elapsed time approximate 15 seconds compared to the pain i went through trying to get my slingbox working with a linksys game adapter installing slinglink renewed my faith in technology awesome ||| 1
i purchased this to use with my newly acquired slingbox pro all i had to do was plug these into wall outlets and connect the lan wires worked like a charm could n't believe it was that easy great performance and good price from amazon ||| 1
bottom line up front works very well very low price works much better with the included drivers than with the generic windows xp driver detailed review i bought this so i could use my new treo with my laptop the price was my main motivation in buying it initially i just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay however it did n't always work and i 'd have to for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other after getting tired of that i decided to install the drivers that ship with the product i 've had a much better experience since i did that i was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price but it 's actually quite good and gives you a ton of options that the standard xp driver does not provide if you use a this with a laptop and you it you 'll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to otherwise you 'll probably end up having to it ||| 1
this is a corded mouse fits comfortably in your hand moves smoothly across table surface works well on a mousepad as well if you need wrist support worked out of the box except for the application button for the different buttons on the mouse the internet buttons allow for a page back with your thumb there are also line buttonw above and below the scroll wheel that allow for more control in scrolling the scroll wheel feel good better than some other mice i have used i opted to use the native windows xp mouse driver so the application button does not work but the windows taskbar is not much of a hardship SMILE and i prefer not to clutter up my system with another set of marginal utility software ||| 1
it has very good definition but is slow even in the night is not that good and is slower ||| 1
while the product description states this battery is compatible with motorola and radios '' the 53615 is compatible with many more to bad amazon could n't put this online for us from the packaging series series series series series series series series series series ||| 1
i purchased this phone system as a gift i set it up and used it extensively the handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone many different ring tones to choose from the antenna lights up when a call comes in you can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you 'll know when they 're calling without picking up the handset talking caller id is great too no more rushing to find the phone only to discover it 's a sales pitch or a call that could wait i set this phone up on a voice over ip cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear the phone is running next to an wireless computer network and has no interference at all one suggestion to make the batteries last longer do not leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time this will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out much faster instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays recharge '' on the screen then let it get a full charge you 'll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so ||| 1
i was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when i ran across these on a website i was a little hesitant at first because i do n't think i ever spent over 40 on a pair of headphones i finally decided to invest in these because i spend most of my free time listening to music i received these the other day and immediately plugged them into my ipod please do n't let the breaking in period discourage you ! after these become comfortable you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time i started with all my heavy bass tracks and could n't believe how they sounded with these headphones i then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded this is the first time in my life john coltrane has given me goosebumps ! if you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you if you are just a casual music listener i would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones you will save a lot of money however if you are a passionate music lover and collector these headphones will change your music completely after getting comfortable with these i would have paid much more than i actually did ||| 1
this is the ultimate ears super fi model especially designed for bassheads '' featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies i do n't think ue would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature yes the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction on the bright side however the bass reproduction is marvelous not only is the of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones i 've ever used the quality is excellent the bass is tight and pleasant neither boomy nor thumpy this overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the ue 5 eb 's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented front and center '' including techno bass aka car audio bass '' drum n ' bass and many types of for music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall opinions will vary with rock music for example the strong bass is certainly a plus but i have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly and some detail is lost it should be noted that this sound signature renders the eb 's a good choice for people who own ipods and feel that their music player is weak on bass without any eq adjustment the ipod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is present in terms of build the eb 's superficially seem and designed i have heard complaints however that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage be careful out there ! thoughtfully eb has includes a variety of ear tips with these iem 's including foam flanged and plain so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit the eb 's do n't extend deeply into the ear canal which is a mixed blessing on the one hand this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal comfort is good and isolation decent however if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the eb 's oh and some people think that the eb 's look kind of strange when worn larger than the super fi 5 pro model the eb 's stick out a bit your call as to whether this is a problem like all of the ue iem 's in this series the eb 's are packaged with a nice set of accessories including a '' adapter plug a sound attenuator a soft travel case an earwax loop and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with iem 's cord tangling it 's unlikely that the eb 's will prove satisfactory as your everyday '' earphone unless you listen solely to types of music the truth is however that even for music the overall sound signature of the super fi 5 pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users i own both but as a second pair specifically for use with music the eb 's are and definitely fun ||| 1
we have this for our ipod and it works fine in both our cars handy and a must buy ! ! ||| 1
this is the gamepad i 've owned my first pc was in 1993 the gamepad was the gravis gamepad i recently upraded and there is no port on the new system plus i need more buttons for need for speed most wanted etc i love this controller i 've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results i 've only used it in nfs games i have them all the wifi works flawlessly and i have a wifi network in my house installation is simple and takes maybe the rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software this is totally understandable the feedback in is very slight but that 's not the controllers fault it 's a matter of programming by ea games i like the weight of the controller it 's not feather light so with that motor and battery weight added it feels more like a premium device just like the 67 with tax i paid for it canadian dollars i did n't like how my gravis gamepad as so light so this is a step up the analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel they are rubber gripped for action i am used to the so i have mine setup in nfs to use both as a directional control without having to press the mode button to switch because you do n't have time during a race to press a button before switching it works as well as my old gamepad but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money if you in the usa you 'll be getting a much better deal it lists for 60 cnd here but only 30 us in the states cons it 's not as comfortable to hold as i would like but its much better than my gravis gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one conclusion i 'm very satisfied overall and i knew i may have to get used to the way it feels when i hold this controller since changing from the old snes style gravis gamepad rating only because it could be easier to hold ||| 1
we have had this phone for almost a year and i love it we have the base station which is also an answereing machine plus we have a sattelite phone i wish we had more satelite phones i love the talking feature because i just listen and know who is calling i also love the programming feature i never have to look aup a tel number that i call regularly anymore i just wish the extra phones were not so expensive to add on great phone buy it ||| 1

i work at a home office so i am on the phone lot i always buy cordless phones i can use with a headset so i can have both arms free while i talk with a min of background noise intrusion in other words i do n't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear and i do n't use speaker phone features let 's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that i could n't care less about this phone first of all looks good and feels good it was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces it has a nice solid weight to itself nothing tacky or cheap about it it looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures and it looks pretty good in pictures i like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked clever design the charging base light and buttons all look very slick the screen is attractive a big step up from lcds or no screen at all like my previous phone i like that you can very quickly find and hit mute adjust volume and page through your caller history the belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around i know many 5.8 ghz phones do n't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency both directions as 2.4 ghz sometimes gets used too i do n't know for sure if this phone falls into that category but i was in the market for a 5.8 ghz phone to avoid interference with my wifi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls one thing 's for sure this phone definitely is immune from my microwave oven in the past when i was on a call heating up my coffee static and voice quality went way down unless i got far away from the oven with this new phone i can stand right by it while on high any impact on voice quality one other very cool feature is the spare battery charger while it 's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away the best part is if you have a power failure your phone will keep truckin ' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived waste of time finally i like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock the phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller id info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station no need to manually set the clock and when not in use sitting it is dock the phone 's screen displays the time so far i 've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone i 've owned ||| 1

i have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure imo you can not beat the sound of a set of '' headphones i have tried all styles earbuds behind the neck clips even the ear plugs nothing gives the sound and comfort of the ktx pros granted i have never tried the sportapros or portapros but from what i have read they are the same headphone except they are ugly ! the ktx pros have both great lows and great highs plus you ca n't beat that price ||| 1

i thought that this flash drive was above average in performance works well between a macintosh and a pc i liked the feature missing from my last flash drive of easily emptying the drive after use without having to some fancy erasing techniques in other words the pny worked like a real hard drive i would like the manufacuters to explain in detail how to attach the tread to the laniard it took me a while to figure it out ||| 1
with so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market it was sort of struggle to decide ultimately i felt very comfortable going with the bose brand plus in my opinion this is about the sleakest and unit out there i went with black i 'm not an drone the sound is very very good for small to medium size spaces there are not a lot of features to the unit which i think is a good thing it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes power cord is plenty long and i like the fact i can easily move the thing to a different room if i need music there ||| 1
well the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock its very simple just put your ipod on there and rock out to the beat the bose quality is very obvious and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it which brings me to my next point its too expensive my recomendation is to buy an fm transmitter and listend to your ipod on any fm raido the only disadvantage of an fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod and its slightly easier but thats what ipod is all about isnt it basically im saying buy it if you have a lot of mone ||| 1

i was devout in my belief that i could get similar photo output from my canon with less expensive paper i bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of kodak 's photo quality glossy from costco my prints were blotchy then i got my hands on some of canon 's photo paper pro and my pictures were magically crystal clear the difference is amazing i never would 've thought paper would make this much difference i 've since bought canon 's 15 sheet packs multiple times i now use the kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who do n't care much about the quality of the output while i save the canon photo paper pro for prints we want to frame ||| 1
this stick is fantastic for high resolution photos and is lightning quick do you need the extra speed the gives you maybe maybe not but at least you have it when and if you need the feature highly recommend it for the money ||| 1
those people giving these speakers low reviews because they do n't have enough bass are idiots i do n't know what people expect of these little speakers but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do these are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels from paris to camping in northern california i can not imagine going everywhere without them they are not equivalent to a stereo system but they are not meant to be all i need is my zen touch or zen micro and these speakers do not listen to the other reviews these speakers will make a decent stereo of your player enjoy them anywhere ||| 1
i have used vosky skype call center for about a year now as my only home skype in phone paying 3.16 a month after getting rid of verizon for which i was paying 50.00 a month pros it works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone easy to set up cons once in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the vosky software and start again you need a computer in summary good value for money and the best way to use skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like skype phones netgear and belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router ||| 1
although i could go on and on about how skype has changed my life forever i will try to address the issue at hand and that is the polycom communicator basically i love the concept of the polycom communicator ! when i first started using skype i used a usb headset that works great the problem is that it is a serious pita to put the thing on when someone calls because i have to either try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection or answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord if i chose option envariably i would miss half the calls if i chose option everyone would always comment that i sounded so desheveled when i tried to answer the call well now with the new polycom communicator all i have to do is answer the call as far as the quality and performance of the polycom communicator that is the only reason i did n't give the item 4 stars it seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines it is really sporadic though and i ca n't seem to reproduce it consistently also the driver for the polycom communicator has crashed on me a couple of times so despite the downfalls that i mentioned above there is no way i could give up my polycom communicator now i simply love it i just wish those other issues never happened ||| 1
well actually i bought this nice cable at amazon marketplace great offering that it was for an hdtv tuner which bombed in my neighborhood so i never did get to unpack the cable but it 's in the closet and it knows it 's a good cable great cable great price thru amazon ||| 1
i 'm a creative fan so these are the first logitech speakers i ever bought and i was pleasantly surprised i was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no i decided for this model well these are perfect to keep on your desktop though the ideal placement of any is on the floor close to a corner as it has a small sized all controls in one the speakers these speakers sound really nice slightly superior sound to creative 's corresponding model sbs 350 but with less output power creative 's sbs 350 is larger and more powerful pros headphone jack and power button in the left speaker no wired remote '' which adds more clutter to your desktop nice design for the price even cheaper than creative 's sbs 350 cons small no wired remote '' which means you have to keep one of the speakers close no bass control which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control ||| 1
i bought one of these to replace the standard card that came with my camera wow now i can store a ton of pictures the price on the ep memory cards are awesome too ||| 1
i have the quest 2 but i 've heard that this also fits the quest i bought it because while my dell laptop backpack is well padded i wanted to make sure that my quest 2 gps was protected just in case '' this case fits perfectly literally like a glove when i got it i was sceptical it looked to small but i was wrong the dimensions are perfect and there is more than enough padding to protect the gps from harm yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket which i sometimes have to late day meetings where i leave my backpack at work all in all it 's another great product from garmin ||| 1
i have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years it keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn the barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt i wash them down each year and they are like new the fans i have now are on their third barn year in a normal house i 'm sure they would last forever they are a little noisy but the horses do n't care ||| 1
i purchased this dashmount so i could swap the gps between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount i do n't know what the feet '' of the base is made of but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket it is heavy yet is very pliable this is useful since my dash a 2004 has an uneven surface i can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it 'll stay there occasionally on long or bouncy '' trips it 'll creep out of position a couple inches and i 'll have to move it back i 've seen some comments complaining of that but i do n't see it as a problem since common sense says it wo n't stay perfectly still since it is n't bolted in place overall this mount has worked very well my wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the gps i do n't recommend she take the mount though since the thing must way at least a couple pounds too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion ||| 1
i got the dash mount because a friend recommended it i thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield i felt like i should remove it each time i parked somewhere also there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling the dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to mold '' to fit the surface of the dash however it kept slipping off the surface of my toyota avalon until i found a little sticky pad to put it on that solved that problem anyway it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when i stop thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber ||| 1
this is my first hotas but i did a good bit of research it is very easy to set up and the sst programming is very helpful setting the shift key the joystick is easy to move which is nice in a close dogfight i am very glad that i bought this hotas because i have had no problems with it i highly recommend this system to anyone ||| 1

we bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming marching this is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice this is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades the drum is a bit heavy large cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is loud the cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality do recommend this purchase it does come a bit steep at 30 but is a very nice looking and performing set if you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans spoil with this set that they should be able to use well into their childhood ||| 1
i found this as the perfect solution to fill in some dead airt space in my house downstairs given the internet connection is upstairs and so far other wireless solutions have been marginal i really wondered if the ethernet over powerlines would really work or if the would really work so i get my new extender kit unbox it and plug everything in without bothering to read the directions lets be real this stuff should be plug and play and it was it came right up and worked and has worked for the past three months flawlessly i have decent range downstairs it works with the macs and the pcs and doesnt seem to care a whit i can highly recommend using this product as the primary connection or as i did extending an existing network without having to pull cable or put in multiple 802.11 bridges ||| 1
i have had no problems with my mini cruzer usb flash drive it has been recognized without exception by multiple computers and has performed flawlessly ||| 1

if you 've got a treo 650 you do n't need a gps device simple as that the gps device talks via bluetooth to your 650 which attaches to your windshield via a holster the charger charges 'em both or not as you see fit the instructions are clear and to the point the installation instructions are slightly out of date you do n't need a card reader to make it happen after all and the user experience is in my case outstanding if you 've got a 650 and you ever drive somewhere unfamiliar buy it ||| 1
when i purchased this product a couple weeks ago i wanted to make sure this purchase was worthwhile i studied many other speaker stands and it just did n't seem i would have been getting the same quality i received this pair a few days ago and originally thought they may be a little complicated to put together they only took about twenty minutes to assemble and put my cube speakers on the stands look great and go well with the cube speakers i am happy i made this investment and will enjoy these for years to come ||| 1

look around in your local electronics stores and you 'll find either hugely expensive players or single tape units this player allows duplication as well as the ability to put two of your old collection in and listen uninterrupted sure it 's not a cd carousel but how else are you going to listen to some of your best stuff that you probably taped yourself this or the other teac units should find a place on your shelf ||| 1
after having used crts roughly the size of small cars for my entire life i finally jumped on the bandwagon this acer 19 '' lcd makes me happy i did ! mostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color brightness and size of the screen really matters to me this monitor really nails all three of those areas it provides vivid crisp colors it does n't wash out the picture with what my old monitor did nor is its display too dark to catch the action and the 19 '' screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size ||| 1

i bought this paper after my mom gave me a box of epson paper she did n't need i was really impressed by the quality of the pictures rendered on that paper by my printer when the paper ran out i looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive on the order of 40 cents per page since you can only get 2 pics from a sheet of paper that comes to about 20 cents per print not counting the cost of ink finally i stumbled upon this paper epson and the price per print was around 12 cents which rivals the cheapest internet photo printing services i 've found if you print a lot of pictures this is a great value for a great product ||| 1
hands down epson paper is the best photo paper on the market at this price its a no ||| 1

i bought this to illuminate the keyboard on my 12 '' apple powerbook when i work in the dark it works well and shines impressively bright and wide i even use it to read by simply sitting it on its back on my lap as i read in bed and pointing the lamp at my book it 's too bad the lamp 's arm is n't telescopic or it 'd make for a perfectly good booklight right out of the box this device is well built folds into a form that protects it from damage even when thrown in a laptop case full of stuff that might crush something built less solidly and it has a nice retracting usb cable the retraction device for the cable like most i 've seen on devices like this can be a bit finnicky but with the right pulling technique works correctly about 90 of the time update may 2005. the light died no idea why so maybe it 's not as good as i thought ||| 1
to really take advandage of this installation was super easy although i ran into the ti thing like another reviewer oh well not much more i can say about this product it works and that 's all that really matters ||| 1
i found this device to be relatively easy and comfortable to use no less and accurate to within 15 ' under tree cover of greater than 90 mature alder and fir once locked onto satellites under clearer overhead conditions in seattle wa and using an external gilsson antenna mounted atop a hat satellite aquisition under the trees did not happen the few times i tried the display is excellent under sunny conditions downloading waypoint data into a text file was simple i have n't used it yet under driving conditions so i ca n't speak to using related features were it damaged or stolen i 'd buy another one without hesitation ||| 1

let 's just say i am 39 and holding and have wanted an for years my birthday was last week and i bought myslef the pink nano it is easy to use but i have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import cd 's the ipod updates fast but the cd import is slow the sound quality is good i like that it is small and lightweight the screen is bright and easy to read even with not so young eyes i looked at other brands but am glad i went with the leader i did n't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen just tunes i 'm sure 1000 songs will hold me i looked all over at prices and amazon wins ! the free shipping is a great bonus also the case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me i have had it in my pocket and it is just fine would highly recommend this it is cute to boot ! this not so young person thinks it is way cool ||| 1
i had been storing my music on a card in my palm pilot i was having a lot of trouble transferring the music with many errors not to mention how long it took to transfer i finally decided to get an player a friend kept telling me about the sandisk sanso there were some great features but the bad far far outweighed the good too many of the same problems over and over and many people returning them i got my apple ipod last night and have hardly put it down ! i did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item this thing is great ! i was up till listening to my music the sound quality is so much better than i had expected ! i really like the case i got tuffwrap accent by walmart and radio shack because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano the only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano the case has more rounded corners in the top so the nano does not line up just right in the case it is good enough and you can still use the controls it is only about a of an inch at most i am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying but the case is still great as far as protection i also bought the belkin tunebase fm transmitter for the car it is similar to the monster version i did not like the belkin version at all i ended up going and getting the monster fm transmitter at radio shack it works great ! i like the fact that my ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock some of you may prefer the dock i like that i can pick up the ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because i can operate it easily without looking down at the dock i can even hold it while driving if i want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock the sound of this transmitter is great some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving but this is minimal and is usually not a problem i find this happened a lot less with monster than with the belkin the belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs people are talking about this unit not having a radio on it but i find that i have so many favorite songs on it that i do not need a radio when i do have a radio all i do is channel surf for songs i like anyway this way i already have all the songs i like at my fingertips ! i think these headphones really make this nano great ! i was so surprised when i first heard this little unit play ! for something so tiny it rocks ! i am really glad i followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the sanso this new nano is a must have ! ||| 1
well the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price and has beaten every price i have seen as for the toner itself hewlett packard toner is top i buy this product for two reasons 1. it 's what fits in my printer and 2. i know when i buy the i am getting what i payed for a quality cartrige that lasts one last note twords the end of the cartrige life a small line appears in the content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one simply shake the cartrige reorder and by the time the new one arrives the old one is finished ||| 1
i 'm not much of a techie but i do have lots of documents and pictures that i ca n't bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day i used to back up my most important files on cd an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple cds and lots of time but with this flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize the files are copied over to the device quickly and easily the 2 gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive scandisk even includes a synch '' software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data the software also helps you copy over your outlook messages folders appointments tasks and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive also i can imagine that the use of the synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine physically the unit is small sleek with a case that feels substantial the retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use this thing is great i only wish i 'd started using it sooner ||| 1

after reading the review in computer pilot i ordered it fine tuning is a bit involved but repetition makes the curve easier configuring from one type throttle to another is easy with the downloadable manager from ch prod compared to the goflight modular system this is great value unless is no object and you 're not interested in building a home cockpit the ch line of controls is well suited to the aspiring and advaced flt simmer ||| 1

when i first came across this particular microphone i had my doubts considering the price of it i just could n't see it holding up for what i wanted to do to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations for recording vocals this mic is amazing a real professional sound for a extremely low price i definitely recommend this mic to anyone out there looking for an in expensive way to make professional sounding material ||| 1
i have some decent mics in my cabinet as well as a nice preamp converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup i was n't expecting as good or better quality than i can already get but i hoped the samson usb studio condenser would at least give me a decent sound the idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits i was not disappointed installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a usb port on my laptop running xp and the other end into the mic it is far from the best mic i have but it is certainly not the worst i have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin but i found that not to be the case the noise floor when recording with the samson is a little high and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my millenia preamp i have to record at slightly lower levels than i am used to but for 79 i am not complaining there is no significant latency recording 16 bits at in fasoft studio the ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating way to go samson ||| 1

the was the last one i tried of three i 've had cordless panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again but the other choices had major drawbacks i really needed a phone that was n't the first i tried was the uniden it had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too this phone uses phone company voice mail no ans mach which is fine but i had the vm system go bonkers so lost all trust in it for over a week messages accumulated but we got no so did n't know there were any new messages arrgghh not the phones fault i know but it required vm for messaging so nope next i tried the new motorola i really wanted to like this phone it 's a ans machine like the panasonic i liked it 's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2. had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three but it 's answering system has no message counter that alone is no big deal but it did n't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages when a new message arrived it blinked and such all good but if i got home say and listened to a message for my wife the blinking stopped and no indication of 1 saved message '' or anything so i would have to write a note to her to check the messages we 're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it 's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance i also would have liked an so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a outgoing line but that would have messed up their simpler style button function hmmm the panasonic i am surprised to say ended up being my favorite hopefully it will be reliable i was always bothered by panasonic 's phones losing the with any little power outage happily this phone sets its from info even though the manual implies it would n't work quite that way with the right settings and phone company options it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one i really like not thinking about which line is what just pick up and talk the has good voice quality and reasonable range it 's much lighter than earlier handsets which i like i also like their shape of handset the best my gripes are the limit of 4 handsets i would like 6 or 7. also ca n't name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number ||| 1
i love my new monster fm transmitter ! it 's very easy to use and the reception is great ||| 1

i thought i was going to have to try to track down some headphones for kids until i ran across these ! they are super comfortable and seem to block the world out i 've been using them for about 3 months now and could n't be happier eventhough i 've got a healthy dose of ear wax building up on them ||| 1
this is n't my first player i have a couple of the years and since my last one died i was looking for a quick cheap replacement i also needed a flash drive for work do n't underestimate this if you use the net at a library or cafe then you 'll realize that 1. not all are recognized as drives 2. you 've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port which gets annoying quickly when you clean out your purse and discover you do n't have it with you with this you get both in one it has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems even the sound quality is good i ca n't tell the difference between this and my 100.00 player the controls do take a few seconds to get used to but once i did i find i preferred them they are easy to use an unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks ! if you turn off the player it starts back up exactly where you left it be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter ! its small without being too tiny its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes wo n't have a its does n't hold a lot of music at only or have a shuffle feature but if you need to carry more than an album or 2 or need extra features then you 'll want more than this player anyway the best feature is the price i found this one at my local toysrus for 15.00 it also plays both 's and wma it wo n't play aac but if most of your music is this format you 'll better off with an ipod this would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles i 'm giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what i need it to do without any hassle ||| 1
i decided to purchase this item because i needed to get sd memory for my digital camera so i chose this one because of the price and the brand sandisk is known for their memory well no need to say more this thing works great i will buy another one but with more space anyday thanks alot san disk ||| 1
just got this one at sears and was only 20 so i grabbed it the canon i have only came with so i needed more space the 128 is much faster and easy to format than my old one love it ! ! ! go out and buy one today ! get sandisk not lexar they break all the time ! ! ! ! ! ||| 1
how many pictures will it store it is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about well considering i worked in the memory industry for over 7 years i can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as i have since changed industries the sandisk secure digital like most cards will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera these numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality jpeg setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera i truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs ||| 1
if you buy this service plan print out the contract found at the top of this page and keep your receipt i did not purchase the plan but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it some notes on the contract 1. it is only good in the united states including washington dc but minus maine but it does not include guam virgin islands etc so if you are in another country or outside the 50 states this contract will be nothing but a waste of money 2. this contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple 3. they will only if the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item that is if the manu warranty is still good you have to use it 4. if the item needs to be shipped will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period if the item is being replaced you will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered product to our authorized service center reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to you '' i 'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you 5. no lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the same defect and a upon the time of a repair as determined by them they will replace it with a product of comparable performance repairs performed while the product is under manufacturer 's warranty do not apply '' does n't sound like a great no lemon policy your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year 6. there are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans such as they do n't cover accidents and they do n't cover the elements or acts of god '' sorry i had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things but in all seriousness read the list before you purchase so now that i have summarized much of the contract if you want to get the service warranty please read the contract since i did n't cover everything ! ! ! do n't hold me liable since i do n't have much money anyways also i think this is typical in warranty contracts but you will occassionally see the phrase at our discretion '' in the contract assuming they are n't jerks with their discretion and are n't too tough to deal with i would give the warranty 4 stars minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy i did n't get the coverage because the product i was going to get it for had just made into the next price category so it was pricy for my product being at the lower price end of the scale ||| 1
there is absolutely nothing that we do n't like about these panasonic phones the sound quality is excellent as is the range very happy customers ||| 1
i have had mine for a week i had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years which was misplaced i bought the navigation kit at the same time i ordered a 60 cs it makes what i bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies i had no problems loading software and maps upload or download my gps i am impressed by the softwares ability to recalculate '' in navigation mode if i ignore the suggested route it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where i am i am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc are concerned but i am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained i have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane and knowledge of streets etc the real test is yet to come to negotiate san francisco 's endless no left turns one way streets construction and limited freeway on ramps ! ! ||| 1
three months later i 'm still amazed at how cheap this amazing piece of hardware was granted it does n't vibrate nor have a zillion buttons but it definitely performs admirably it is comfortable and the buttons respond well the unit feels and connects to the computer easily via usb and as a bonus it looks pretty too ||| 1
i bought this based on the overall positive reviews good sound quality and a comfortable fit i did n't find them to be too tight at all for a pair of headphones i think they 're pretty impressive ||| 1
the cups of these heaphone are a little small and they do fit snuggly on my head but after stretching them out a bit i must say they are very comfortable if you dont like them at first wear them for a while they will grow on you ||| 1

i 'm using the product as i respond to this request for a review sufficiently compact for ease of packing in my laptop case no technical issues so far tracking is excellent has worked flawlessly under daily working conditions recommend highly ||| 1
this mouse works perfectly fast and easy without problems even if you do n't install the software if you need a cordless mouse this is what you have to bu ||| 1
as the title states this is an excellent wireless mouse works right away with windows xp no driver install or software needed for and normal scroll capabilities software allows for extra button assignment but could use some work i have had some trouble finding the menus i want when i want to find them for example i have an issue where i can not find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the usb receiver after a system however i am able to find those menus in the software if i remove and reinsert the receiver but as i said before superb mouse function and tracking this thing works on upholstery leather my jeans and thick carpet ! ! ||| 1
the is another great logitech product it is far from the king of the mouse but when it comes to the notebook it does n't get much better than this it takes two aa batteries so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots the mouse does n't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves this is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel with the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do overall the design is good there could be a problem installing setpoint it may hang on install if so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again it should work the usb receiver is 2.4 ghz and has a 10 meter range wow however there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook usb dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off for this reason you should have the usb receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand if you can to avoid accidental contact it should also not be hanging over the edge of the table if you press it down lightly then that is it game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 ghz receiver so okay you will have to spend on a new receiver if you break the old one the receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet when it is in the holder the mouse turns off it does n't fit in smoothly it creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in the other thing is that it can pop out sometimes just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way i am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices if you are then a mouse like this and usb should last for a very long time there is really nothing wrong with it wireless mini mouse fab ! however there is one last thing to say if you do n't like the idea of a usb receiver then get a bluetooth version of this mouse instead it is called the that is if your notebook has internal bluetooth or else you will need to get a bluetooth usb receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your usb receivers but if you have a bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the and forget about this usb option the usb design is n't a fault with the mouse it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault you just got to switch to internal bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers ||| 1
when i purchased this product i was a little sceptical however once i unpacked it and started using it it was so absolutely easy to use and the pictures have such a fine quality and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection so i see it as a product the only draw back is the weight and size i just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel ||| 1
first and foremost i am not an audiophile so i ca n't comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves they are fine for me and my listening habits i find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine although when i do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me that being said what i wanted was a convenient way to carry my nano so i could listen and manipulate the controls with the ipod handy yet out of the way this lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and i would recommend it to anyone so why four stars well for a few reasons only available in white i have a black nano i 'd have liked to match it no lock or release on the base that connects to the nano while the connector does fit snug with the nano and does n't disconnect so easily from the nano that i 'd fear it might fall off while walking about i would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place for this reason i would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise but hanging loose around the neck really is n't the best place for the nano then anyway the armband would be more appropriate nowhere on the packaging did it say this was for the nano ! i had bought a nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when i discovered it was incompatible the dock connector and headphone jack on the and nanos are not the same distance apart when this lanyard arrived i could find nothing on the package that said for nano '' so i opened it very gingerly thinking i had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back i was very relieved when it did fit ! regardless there should be a very clear for nanos only ! '' label on the box to alleviate nano owners ' fears and to warn nano owners all in all i am very happy with the lanyard it keeps the nano handy while leaving my hands free and that was what i was looking for ||| 1
it 's been through the wringer and has had no problems after about a year i came here looking for a replacement cap but ca n't find one on amazon ||| 1

the sennheiser have only one thing wrong with them they 'll change you from someone who enjoys good audio into an audiophile ! i 've been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top av forums but i 've always been satisfied with merely decent '' audio until now i 'd previously ripped all my cds into the previously quite impressive windows media format at bps but that 's now useless with the phenomenal ability of the sennheiser to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline here we go again it 's time to rip everything into lossless format i can not recommend these headphones more highly they are simply extraordinary when your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality though life 's going to get a lot more expensive as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation still this is a bloody miracle my ears have finally been opened wow ||| 1
having been a buyer of sennheiser products for over 10 years i feel it is time i endorse a product i truly believe in and have never been let down by including service and customer satisfaction each time buying a sennheiser product i found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer when i bought the 's i had just come away from years owning the when these encountered a technical problem i replaced them with a backup choice the 's the difference in sound going 'lower ' down their scale of products was just too much to bear so i bit the bullet and went higher whether you use sennheiser 's merely for pleasure or for studio work the accuracy of their sound and what you get for your money can not be beat my 's ran into a small technical glitch and sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt and i swear i nearly cried in their absence 's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded how good your system is and what truly sounds inferior you never listen to things quite the same way again the reason my reviews of paul mccartney and john lennon albums from the 70 's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is especially compared to the so called ''economy class beatles '' george harrison 's and ringo starr 's albums from the same decade is down to what 's reveal my main source of media tends to be vinyl because compact discs and dvd 's still can not capture what equipment captures vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round ' in comparison to its digital counterparts and when listening to badly recorded albums 's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio 's are the reason i mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying lennon and mccartney solo albums listening to ''take it away '' from 1982 's tug of war reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence ' a track that had a recording on it before the instrument actually showed up in the song it sounds totally like electrical amp noise coming from equipment and geoff emerick or george martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song it gets much worse than 'take it away ' on paul mccartney albums and even more painfully so on john lennon albums but listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums back to the egg ram double fantasy milk and honey and some portions of band on the run and walls and bridges 9 dream is simply a gorgeous recording it 's just too bad the rest of the album does n't sound as good as that one song when you listen to your cd 's vinyl dvd 's in whatever room of your house your speakers are the room dictates what you hear no matter what you 've spent on speakers power amps woofers etc whether you have wall to wall carpeting high ceilings low ceilings plaster or cement wood floors a more long than wide room it all affects how sound reaches your ear which is why on a great set of headphones you are more likely to hear how those sounds were meant to be heard how they were recorded and how much time was spent doing it on speakers mccartney 's jet sounds quite full though the snare is a little thin but when hearing the album with 's the drums nearly become and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone mccartney on drums is not a miracle especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on bass can i review anything without bringing up lennon and mccartney quite possibly dog food but so far they come up pretty regularly makes you wonder if i 'm trying to prove a point does n't it albums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with sennhesier 's they truly do some noteworthy recordings from the 70 's and 80 's when recording technology for popular music was just beginning to reach new highs that are all friendly isao tomita 's the firebird 1976 george harrison 's eponymous album 1979 steely dan 's gaucho 1980 joe walsh 's the smoker you drink the player you get 1973 's the original soundtrack 1975 godley creme 's consequences 1977 supertramp 's crime of the century 1974 xtc 's black sea 1980 peter gabriel 's album 1980 kate bush 's the dreaming 1982 earth wind and fire 's all 'n ' all 1977 level 42 's the pursuit of accidents 1982 billy cobham 's spectrum 1972 frank zappa 's one size fits all 1975 ringo starr 's goodnight vienna 1974 and a truly incredible sounding album from the 90 's prince and the new power generation 's ''symbol '' album from 1992. albums not friendly todd rundgren 's hermit of mink hollow 1978 blue oyster cult 's agents of fortune 1976 paul mccartney 's venus and mars 1975 and quite a few others john lennon 's imagine 1971 and avoid 1970 's instant karma like the plague the piano track will hurt you yes 's fragile often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping and surprisingly enough many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated cd reveal the errors of fixing something that ai n't broken if you have to save up for a pair or do some heavy searching for 's that are affordable do so in over 10 years i have never been disappointed by anything sennheiser distributed especially when i kept up with their pace ||| 1
i just purchased one of these and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews that stated how difficult it was to load the information into the unit i had no problem at all in fact it was quite simple i am truly amazed at how acurate and easy to use this unit is for the price you ca n't beat it ||| 1

i was mislead with amazon review which said it supports conversion to format with the software supplied it does not the help quite clearly states you can not convert a file into an file '' it will convert to then you can use a party program to go to if it had support at least conversion on the pc from the sony proprietary format which is i would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible it you record in full quality mode 1.25 hours with built in memory and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing the voice up so you hear each person in a conversation works very well as do other nice features but it is let down with the software supplied not performing conversion going to then with another program is a pain and simply converting to to get away from proprietary takes up too much space but i would buy one again as it is very easy to use small and very high quality i just hope sony would listen to consumers and support ||| 1
this is the same cartridge i can purchase elsewhere but cheaper it works well in our printer with no issues whatsoever and my hp printer prints fantastic photos when i use hp ink and hp premium photo paper ||| 1

before i bought this device i was trying to enjoy the hearts of space '' website this american life '' and other npr shows available for online streaming only problem was i did n't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them i did some research on the internet read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the logitech wireless music system i would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here it was indeed quite fast and easy to set up no lengthy manuals to read thank goodness i did not find it necessary to load the cd software that came with the device if i want to listen through the stereo i plug in the usb if i want to listen through the computer i simply unplug the usb it 's very simple i am 100 satisfied with the sound quality i would not be able to tell the difference between fm radio and the online streaming however i do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when i am sending internet audio streams to it using this device than when i am listening to a cd or the radio on my stereo which is n't fancy this does not cause diminished sound quality so i 'm perfectly ok with it i just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to cd or radio listening if you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo check for two things first your stereo has to have a set of two holes that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red i 'm sorry i do not know the technical names for these things but there 's a picture of the plugs on this amazon page in the manufacturer 's product description '' section just scroll up until you see it second your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to auxiliary '' input my stereo has this but my portable cd aka boom box does not if it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house outside be sure to check your player for these two things overall i am very satisfied and quite happy with the product ||| 1
the has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years i bought my first one when i was a consultant and it lasted until august 2006. it withstood all the travel and constant use well i use it for simple and complex math statistical analysis and financial analysis it is much faster and simpler to operate than a pc my new one has all the same great features i highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis ||| 1
i bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now the nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works it works beautifully when it does n't work it is erratic and locks up turn it on and off and while the led will light up it will still not work well this is the hint that the battery is low the mouse comes with two rechargable nimh aaa batteries these are batteries and are not the best i bought 4 accupower nimh batteries i keep 2 in the charger these batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day but as soon the mouse starts to get erratic you have to swap the batteries do this and you will really like this mouse another nice feature for this mouse is the range you can use your laptop as a dvd player connected to your tv and sitting out of the way the mouse makes a nice remote control ||| 1
this is a great printer i have used it several times and it makes great pictures i had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great tried this on a regular printer and the print did n't look near as great a great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have you can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards colors are great and vivid also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop i have not tried printing to non epson paper so i ca n't say how prints would look i know that epson printers look the best printed on epson paper ||| 1
the camers is good in picture quality and easy to install and use it 's multi utility for desktop and notepad is a very good feature which i personally expected i have a complete satisfaction ||| 1
although the rear speakers need a power plug this system solved my problem of being unable to run a signal wire to the back speakers from the front the sound is ok not awesome but not bad better than the tv speakers by a long shot they can also be nicely controlled with my harmony remote ||| 1
very good worth the money if you want a louder one go for z 535 ||| 1

i love this keyboard after searching through just about every keyboard available i was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price i 'm so glad that i chose this one it is excellent ! the quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want it 's a great keyboard for gaming office use media or just ordinary everyday use they keystrokes are effortless and near silent the slide zoom feature is cool but i do n't use it much it 's better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though i really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files or web pages with immediate ease the only thing i do n't like about this keyboard is the sleep button i never use this and i ca n't see any way to reasign it however it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard aside from all of that how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price and it was delivered the day after i ordered it to top it off it feels sturdy and well made i would reccomend this keyboard to anyone it is a great all around keyboard with either usb or connectability ||| 1
i have been into since 1996 i used winplay and and thought it was the most amazing thing ever i bought one of the first cd based players and then a nomad jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk next was the 10 gig model and then i upgraded to the nomad zen with usb the zen went with me everywhere africa europe my living room after about hours of use and abuse it finally died i needed a replacement so i looked at ipod and zune but why would i stray from creative labs besides it 's better in every way better screen than the ipod better interface than the zune and a better battery than either one when i plugged it into my computer i was blown away xp found the player and without any drivers or proprietary think itunes software i was able to drop my SMILE files right onto the generous space available i was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything or ever being forced to reboot my pc i transferred a couple of movies and i 'm looking forward to my next flight ||| 1
this is my first time ever buying a really expensive player i bought it three weeks ago if i had n't seen the creative zen vision m i probably would have bought the sandisk sansa i love being able to bring my shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv there is one problem i 've had with it i 'm not sure if anyone else has had this but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when i 'm listening to music i do n't think it 's the because i 've never ran into the problem with my other players if only they would 've added the video cable for the tv and kept the charger then i would 've rated it a 5 ||| 1
bought this dvd player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since it has many features and a good picture you ca n't beat the large screen i like the zoom feature especially another feature i like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you do n't have a bulky protrusion when it 's sound is not loud as others have said but i have yet to find a portable dvd player that has good sound you 'll have to use external speakers or ear phones included another thing i notice is that or r are not supported they play but the menu system does not work you have to access the file manually that being said i can not find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than 299 the shipping was fast and free there is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold '' but the unit i got was brand new and not refurbished so far so good i do n't thonk you will be disappointed ||| 1

i was really pushing the limits of my monster surge protector with 2 tvs a with desktop tv dsl two printers and please fridge all crammmed into a corner office setup about 7 ' wide the belkin gold unit with suppression up to cured all the rattle and hum problems with speakers satellite signal the dirty '' line into my modem and a week later i have n't had to reboot my system once amazing ! i had already had a great experience with a belkin surgemaster on my home theater setup so i went one level up with this gold '' unit one of the better investments i 've made lately i paid 60 at the local office depot the price amazon is advertising is ridiculously low at 35 's price is about 70 so my advice is to buy this unit now before somebody at amazon wakes up and jacks the price ||| 1
i bought this recorder to use as backup for event video recording i have also used it concert settings the record quality is astounding full range of dynamics using both the stereo input and the '' inputs it is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio first thing i did was to upgrade to a compactflash card the provided card is too limited battery life is adequate for hour plus recordings and connection and downloading to pc is a breeze the wav files are really high quality it all works as advertised the only minor glitch i have had is that when you first try to start a recording it gives a media full '' message even tho the media is empty then you select record again and it records just fine i went several iterations with tech support who were very friendly and helpful but the problem has not been resolved i also suspect the part flash card may be contributing to this glitch i would buy this recorder again ||| 1
i am glad i bought this backpack it exceeded all my expectations i strongly recommend this one ||| 1
very sturdy with no flimsy plastic parts right into the palm of your hand though it may be a bit thick quality and screen clarity is superb superior to other counterparts to use software radio and voice recorder is a definite plus ! takes getting used to n't listem to music while viewing pictures definitely a great buy you will not be disappointed ||| 1
i got this less robust remote because i only wanted to use it on one system and i was able to set it up and program all the different buttons and it all fits nicely in my hand they have great customer support available on the weekends the best part is everything goes on and off with one button ! the drawbacks a couple of buttons you ca n't program or use for anything and my goofey tv has 3 component modes and this thing is set up for 2 so getting it to sink up right is tricky and it 's constantly getting out of sink ||| 1
i must say moster xp speaker wire makes a huge sound inprovement on mt 6.1 home theater setup my side and rear channels are so clear and crisp i have these runing threw my walls and ceiling and the intall was a brezz do the jacket by these cables you will love them for your surond speakers wayne mn ||| 1
i am a soldier serving in iraq i bought an ipod while deployed and figured it would get ruined by the dirt dust and my combat duties i was fortunate to find the iskin eclipse it is perfect for this environment it completely encases the ipod to protect it from dirt and dust it also has a hard exterior faceplate the protects the ipod from damage the eclipse also makes it easy to use the controls even when playing the new games put out by itunes to put it simply i am one happy soldier thanks to the iskin eclipse ||| 1

ok so i upgraded form a 30 inch lcd to a 50 '' plasma screen all the sales guys kept trying to get me to buy a power center i came home did some research and chose this one if it did n't improve sound or picture at least i knew that the equipment was protected from power surges i hooked everything up last light and turns it one omg ! ! ! ! amazing my yamaha receiver and wharfdale diamonds 8.2 no longer sounded muddy but insted bright and even toned the kick from the sub was tight no sloppy and precise it turned a good system into an eye opener the sony progressive scan and lg plasma now are like looking at real people no a screen the hd stiff is simply the best digital cable it good and the dvd 's are quite near hd all in all i would highly reccomend this to anyone the blue light is quite bright but i placed a piece of blue painters tape over it and it is no longer a problem the voltage meter light is adjustable and not an issue i now know the voltage in my home ranges between 123.5 to 121 ||| 1
needed better protection than my 10 surge protector for my ht setup now that i have a couple dvrs a plasma filtering would be a nice side benefit too very little more than the design units i was looking at now i see it dropped even lower ! pros build quality fit finish plenty of outlets diversity of outlets for me nice compared to design cool looking leds meter cons those cool looking leds can not be dimmed are too bright esp the blue one ! if facing ht viewers i just blocked the leds black card cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider cablevision caused more artifacts on hd channels so could n't use the cable line filter bottom line seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing amazon ||| 1
actually 4 and a half stars i borrowed one of these amplified ipod speaker systems for a weekend camping trip and was impressed with the sound and portability i decided to buy one of my own after looked at several other makes and models all of which were more money plenty of connectivity along with base adapters to hold most ipod models securely the little subwoofer and 'ambiance ' switch make decent sound even at low volume levels close to being a steal at the 59.00 i paid for i ||| 1
excellent sound from phones and microphone comfortable on head and ears plenty of cable on cable controls are handy ||| 1
i was looking for something suitable to house my sansa and this fit the bill better than most the leather case is superb looking sharp snug and protective i enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it the cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth great for cleaning the screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles still have n't figured out how yet and i may trim it to make it more visually appealing but really if you invest in a product such as this it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen ! the larger case is compact and protective having a small storage area yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap generic looking sansa logo only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt but not as a removable type only if you put it on when putting on the belt which can be impractical in some circumstances this way i suppose it would n't be able to fall off ||| 1
i wasnt sure how these would work since one of the ratings on them was negative but i just did a practice on my daughters shirts it was so easy and they peeled off very well my girls love their shirts with their own pictures on them these are a great buy and worth their money ||| 1
while thinking of ideas for my church 's anniversary celebration i decided to make and sweatshirts using transfers and my ink jet printer i chose the invent it ! '' brand from hammermill papers because it was the most cheapest i created the design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper the results were outstanding for a project i followed the instructions included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake one thing that i did find out keep the transfers dry after they have been printed one got wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in contact this product also does a very good job in black and white not just in color the shirts that i did laundered according to the instructions came out of the wash lookin ' good i wo n't hesitate to use this product again in the future however i am now having trouble buying it locally since my previous source no longer handles this product ||| 1
we purchased the in august as a companion to our hitachi ultravision television what a fabulous piece of audio equipment ! when we began searching for a replacement for our infiniti surround system my husband and i had different concerns he is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and i was ready for aestethic simplicity no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere when we found the we thought it was too good to be true one speaker instead of five does n't take up any floor space we visited two yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves one had the set up in a room environment the other on the salesroom floor in both it performed consistantly in both demonstrations however my husband felt the sound could use enhancement so we made the purchase and opted to use the with our existing subwoofer installation was fairly simple provided you have the necessary tools the most important and part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television now that it is installed and in use in our home i feel the sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the my husband though prefers the action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound more than movies the sound quality you get when listening to cds is absolutely stunning overall we both got what we wanted expert sound designation and sleek minimalistic styling with the added bonus of more floor and wall space ||| 1
you bought the ipod nano basically for its looks buy this for the same reason its so cute and fits your nano exactly as you wish i bought an item from another company and though it was cheaper it looked dirty on my computer table this one has the apple '' look ||| 1
i chose these by reading other reviews on amazon i am pleased with them and recommend them good sound light weight the best feature is that they do not leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you this is perfect for an nyc subway rider do n't want to annoy others by leaking sound but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what 's going on only con once you lose or wear out the removable spongy pieces i 'm not sure where you can get replacements ||| 1
these ear buds are great for people with small ears i 've tried several and these are by far the best it comes with 3 sizes of buds and the smallest work best for me ||| 1
this is a terrific phone it has a ton of great features and the three handsets is very convenient this is the only phone that i use now i only keep one analog phone for power outages if you 're looking to clean up a little bit of phone clutter this is a great way to do it ||| 1
we are very satisfied with our purchase this phone system is great and very easy to use super clarity volume etc also super fast shipping from amazon i chose super saver shipping and it arrived in less than 24 hours ||| 1
i saw the other reviews and was hoping i would have the same experience as the happy reviewers well i got the cam and it was easy to install like they say it just takes a little tinkering with the pc options before you use it with the mic and software it comes with you get a lot for your money ! if i bought a cam in the store i would have been mad to lose out on this pc camera it is sweet ||| 1
ok mimo is becomming popular dont give a darn my home net work relies on a cable modem my house is 2 story high and it 's made of steelbar concrete with brick wall here and there since the internet performenc is lower then max all i wanted was penatration through the concrete i 'v used pen type usb adapters and so on but they were always short in range but was another demention allover the house allrange ! when i put this close to the wall adjacent to the negihbor 's house i was able to update my neighbor 's router firmware i 've done it twice already speed is not the main concern in my case but you guys should know about it 's response speed its a little slower then pcmcia types even if i use connection but i think thats because my lap top is running on celeron as long as you have a good pc faster then ! you wont have any problems it 's not that hot dont worry ! i wont give this product because it 's not small enough who needs mimo ! ps use the zero config not the stupid utility ||| 1
this extension cord did what it was supposed to do and did it just fine no problems whatsoever ||| 1
as soon as i bought this from amazon the price went up from 21 to 37. i was going to buy another one but the price is too high overall this is a great product it has everything you need however i would n't buy it at the current price i 'm waiting for the price to go down before i buy another one ||| 1
work fine with my hp pavillion increase the performance of my laptop ||| 1
i tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the 's but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor and they were uncomfortable the yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications they effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable although they seem a bit expensive i 've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them just soak squeeze rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new you can do this three or four times then just toss them away highly recommended ||| 1
once the speaker of choice for every hard rockin ' audiophile with a big enough garage klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that did n't know the real value of what they 'd bought but after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles klipsch is back on top from a sound quality standpoint and it shows in the promedia 2.1 thx i have my trio connected to a new mac pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical yes there are more complex with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room but if you just want the magic without the madness the klipsch promedia 2.1 thx is an incredible and very affordable solution that 's quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes of course there are other desktop systems by makers like logitech cyber acoustics and intec but here 's the difference klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers not the same thing the only brands that are true competitors to klipsch in this area are bose harman kardon jbl and altec lansing i find that the altec lansing and jbl sets both sound nasal and tinny '' on the high end while the bose and harman kardon sets sound great but are more expensive so after a good look and listen around i went with klipsch in any case this is an incredible sound for your music player and should not be overlooked enjoy ||| 1
this splitter was as part of a configuration that splits one line from the street into three and then into sixteen ports and a line to the cable modem for a fraternity house i used this brand of splitters and a moterola amplifier all the way through and the results were amazing the picture quality is crystal clear even when almost all of the ports are in use and the internet is blazing fast compared to the we used to have with some cheap splitters and a radio shack amplifier these pieces are well worth the small extra cost ||| 1
these cables are super with my new dvd player there is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment the picture is soo clear and vivid the cables themselves are really made well they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt if you get these monster cables you wo n't be sorry ||| 1
i previously had a 2.1 sound system for my computer that were pretty good a few years ago when i bought them when i decided to replace them with these i was rather happy with my choice the sound is extremely clear and crisp whether it be music or games and i am very pleased with them the only downside to them is how many extra cords there are behind my desk but you have to expect that with a 5.1 sound system ||| 1
i am glad i bought this backpack it exceeded all my expectations i strongly recommend this one ||| 1
these are really great super noise cancelling affordable they cover my ears completely without problem at first the headset was a bit tight so i stretched the top headband upwards a little to relax or slightly loosen it no more problem while still having a snug fit these headphones also fold up very compact have two plug adapters and a nice durable sack for storage if you buy these just make sure they fit well for your ears if so these are great if not try another type like all things that touch the body it is best to try at a local store before you buy it this is the lowest price i have seen for this product ||| 1
i am happy with my purchase i only bought it because i do n't like the idea of going deaf listening to loud music through earphones i would not use this product to entertain at a party but it serves my needs ||| 1
on a recent trip i was 23 hours in transit and could n't have made it without this little device it powered my movies and tv shows for at least 12 hours or so without a flicker i was worried that the four aa batteries would make it heavy to carry but it did n't matter when the device was sitting on my tray table besides it was comforting to know that aa batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world by the way i substituted the original batteries with duracells on the advice of previous reviewers ||| 1
i bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to italy and i am very happy with it i never had to change my batteries once and i listened to it all the time reading other people 's reviews i threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great the only complaint i have is the suction cups are n't that great several times my ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun overall i recommend this product it is a little bulky but if you 're someone like me who can not live without music it 's a great product to have if you are n't going to be able to charge your ipod ||| 1
i have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control i experienced the same thing until i realized that i mistaken the up down buttons with the buttons the volume works just fine on my wife 's old sony receiver the remote is quite nice and it does everything the ipod control could do as stated in others ' reviews you ca n't read the screen from a distance thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless however it would be worse if the remote could n't scroll through menus it is compatible with the latest video ipod i have the 60 gig ipod but i do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers i listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me i bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as i am in terms of sound quality then again i do n't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup since i have this little gadget for my wife i bought the squeezebox for myself from slim devices to stream music which sounds a lot better in summary this dock does a good job and the design is not bad the construction is solid and i like the light on the remote if you are looking for great sound quality i have n't encountered any dock that is better than this one so this might be your best bet the apple cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and i see more value in this dock ||| 1
i 'm really happy with this purchase i was worried that it would not work with rhapsody which is the media player i use the most but it proved to work well with it in fact it works with all the media player i 've thrown at it including windows media player medialife realplayer itunes rhapsody divx player windvd and powerdvd all the buttons are functional and i worship functionality hence the 5 stars although firefox users have to deal with extra configuration steps to make the back and forward button work no biggies though since setting up is really easy basically all you have to do is open the setpoint software that was installed with the driver point to the intended buttons that you want to program and assign a corresponding keystroke to it in this case it 's for forward button and for back button click apply '' and you 're good to go ' ! ! battery life so far is really good it 's been going on the same set of duracell aa batteries since i got it 3 months ago and still going strong the rf range is really good although admittedly my room is n't big enough to really put its range to the test users should be happy with the range though you could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie this mouse is also great looking not but actually sharp and slick it does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control but as a mouse it 's really sturdy and ergonomic i ca n't comment on installation since it 's been a while since i first used it but i guess no impression is good impression if it was troublesome i 'm sure i 'd remember i 'd second the other reviewer 's gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse and this fantastic mouse does n't come with a cordless keyboard but it 's a great buy all in all ||| 1
it would seem even to a that someone has switched your uniden tech data around secondly terms such as standard '' mean less than trustworthy when applied to sensitivity and selectivity please do n't feel i berate these 2 fine as i am a i would like the actual bench test measurements for an informed i would like to know if cobra 1000 or 2000 series are availible as they still have the best selectivity and sensitivity that i have had on my bench yo ||| 1
until an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound these were my favorite pair of earphones they were comfortable i often left them in when i went to sleep affordable lightweight durable and had good sound quality i used them with my sony boombox my oritron portable cd player and my rca player on all three bass and detail was great and there was no distortion at a higher volume all in all these earphones were a great value the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound which i got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones it lent a bit of warmth to the music i plan to buy another pair in the near future and i highly recommend that you do so as well ||| 1
ordering was fast and easy could not detect any inferiority in the cartridges and will order them again ||| 1
i received it today and it 's a monster if you 've seen one in a store it looks twice as big on your desk until a few hours ago i was running two 20 '' aluminum cinema displays on a pny after doing online research about using the 30 '' display under windows xp i found that the functional '' cheap solution being used is in fact the pny verto with two dvi connectors considering that the other two most noted solutions quadrofx 4000 agp or parhelia pci are going for on ebay i was willing to give my old beater a try besides i did n't feel like buying another agp card with pcie taking over the world or sacrificing the only pci slot in my shuttle xpc to my great relief the monitor worked on the card right away even showing me the post and windows screen it did for the 20 '' displays too but to my absolute delight the card is actually running both the 30 '' and a 20 '' in color the 20 '' looks absurdly small next to the 30 '' like i did n't water it enough or something the 30 '' is enormous enough that i think it might be better were it curved ! maybe i 'm just sitting too close the only problem with the is that the dvi jacks are so near each other that i had to take the plastic housing off of the 20 '' plug to fit it below the 30 '' i 'm not a gamer so i ca n't say whether the card performs well for that it feels as zippy as with the 20 '' on regular windowing tasks i use eclipse flash photoshop but no video editing or stuff the screen had a slight warm cast that i did n't like nvidia 's control panel let me adjust it manually and now my 30 '' and 20 '' look almost identical my biggest fear was of course dead pixels by the good grace of lucky ducks this is the third panel i 've gotten from apple with no dead pixels brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges it 's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it in any case i bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once and it does a fine job at that i 'm using the 20 '' for browsing and alas a few panels that still do n't fit apple where 's 3840 x 2400 i strip one star cuz it 's crazy expensive ||| 1
this screen is great upgraded from a 23 '' and the increase in realestate is awesome you can play games with crystal clarity have so many pages up and read them clearly you will need a graphics card that supports dvi not a card that says dual dvi i installed the geforce 7800 gt on my pc and it works flawlessly ! the quadro cards are great but big the can be had for under 300 ! here 's a list of cards for pc and apple nvidia geforce ddl agp for powermac nvidia geforce ddl agp for powermac nvidia geforce 6600 pci express for powermac pci express nvidia geforce pci express for powermac pci express nvidia quadrofx 4500 pci express for powermac pci express for the pc windows platform the following graphic cards support the apple 30 '' cinema display nvidia quadrofx 2000 nvidia quadrofx 3000 nvidia quadrofx 3400 nvidia quadrofx 3450 nvidia quadrofx 4000 nvidia quadrofx 4400 nvidia quadrofx 4500 nvidia geforce nvidia geforce nvidia geforce 512 ||| 1
outstanding item plenty of room to carry dvds enough padding to protect the player but not too bulky ||| 1
i ordered as soon as it was advertised by garmin but they shipped instead six weeks later i got the update dvd my wife and kids had to make due with while in madrid she was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence however she noted that madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways in the end she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit her route ||| 1
if you understand this product 's limits before you buy it you 'll be happy it shows topographical contours rivers and most streams for the entire united states in addition to that it shows roads that were in existance years ago these major roads are also named the limit is that newer roads do n't show up it also does n't support even if your gps does garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package is n't suited for it the product support could be better neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 cds on your computer so you do n't have to swap cds when transitioning between zones the company 's web site does n't give a good explanation of what the software can and ca n't do you 'll be disappointed if your expectations are n't grounded in reality garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available ||| 1
i am very pleased with my purchase of the envision monitor it arrived in perfect condition no dead pixels i resisted spending the money on a new monitor for a long time but now i 'm glad i made the switch to lcd the color and clarity is wonderful most of all i love having all this extra space on my desk for the money this is a great monitor ||| 1
i just recently bought a sony model dvd player to replace my older more out of date player i hooked it up and to my surprise it was n't any better than my old player as far as quality then i purchased cables from monster video and now the colors are more vibrant the picture is in and i can see every little detail on the screen the picture quality that these cables produce are surpassed only by component video cables which cost many times more the price if you are considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of only one dvd you can get better performance and picture quality ||| 1
i wanted to thank amazon for their quick response to my first order not arriving within a week they sent me another i have been using it everyday and have not gotton lost i install wood flooring in nj pa ny works like a charm i use it with my palm treo ||| 1
for the most part i do find hp ink to be the best however every now and then a new ink cartridge is bad one of the colors does n't print for some reason my opinion is that these ink cartridges are just too expensive to be getting any bad ones ||| 1
i used this card on my nokia for storing files granted i ca n't fit my entire music collection on it but if i wanted to i 'd buy an ipod this is perfect for listening to my favourite songs on the go as well as taking pictures and video clips ! highly recommended ||| 1
i purchased this product to use with my camera the charging lasts very good time would recommend this product to others good work amazon ||| 1
i love sound systems so when i got my new reciever sony i hooked up the new speaker wires with the thx certified gold plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference i miscalculated how much wire i needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire i can hear a light and day difference in sound quality needless to say i 'm ordering more to complete the job the monster fiber optic cable is a must as well i can hear sounds that i normally could n't on my old system i like testing sound with the hulk the scene were he tears up the tanks saving private ryan taking the beach and open range gunfight at the end of the movie in all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that i could not before the new wire and connectors excellent product ||| 1
this is my first player so i researched it carefully before making my decision the gorgeous screen the wide number of codecs it supports and the hard drive were all selling points i 'm so glad i bought it videos look great on the screen some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general i love it the built in speaker does n't do it justice even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing making playlists with the creative software is very easy my biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it no case no screen protectors out for it i 'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do but for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the ipod or the zune ||| 1
this adapter can not be used with the garmin 330 ||| 1
a little bouncy while running but a convenient product fits perfectly around all of my players large and small ||| 1
this is a great phone memory is easy to progam the phone has 3 memory keys for emergenies and 9 additional memory keys for personal numbers it can be used on a desk or hung on the wall the only thing i do n't like about the phone is the buttons on the handset however i knew about this feature before purchasing the phone i would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a good basic phone ||| 1
i did a lot of research on before i finally decided on this mouse i wanted to replace my extremely small kensington usb mouse with a retractable cable at home i use a wacom tablet next month i am traveling abroad so i wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the kensington wireless was key for portability i also wanted something rechargeable and i did n't want the usb adapter sticking out i received it today and i 'm on my first charge so no comments on batteries which can be replaced with other aaa nimh for optimal performance if desired anyway i have large but skinny hands mouse is small but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers of course convenience is not comparable to a mouse but if you want portability this is about the right size i have a powerbook that runs tiger 10.4 excellent bluetooth connection also very good response very little delay only reservation is for the scroll wheel which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position it is hard to explain but not a big issue for me usb charger works well the added size of the usb adapter helps with comfortability still flat but becomes an otherwise mouse despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse as mentioned by others installing the batteries is a challenge pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top part with the anycom label away from the clickers once i figured it out not so hard overall i do n't seek perfection anyway so this mouse does the job adequately for me i have n't tried any other bluetooth mouse before so i 'm more or less in awe ||| 1
this card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use 512 mb is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 mb or less camera assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time with the setting i use on my camera most often this card holds over 400 photos and it will hold even more for those using a more setting do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you but i 've had no problems with sandisk products ||| 1
i have to admit i 'm a gps junkie i 've had a variety of gps units over the past decade and currently own 3 the being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving i am greatly impressed with this unit it was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download for those who are interested when a gps unit is turned off and moved a significant distance say miles from where it last thought it was it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the gps satellites this can take a few minutes in any case after the initial automatic recalibration the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever i turned it on the user interface is very easy to use i 've used hertz neverlost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface i think garmin 's is better one highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for points of interest poi but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating this allows you to identify say hotels along your route while you are driving and then using the telephone info provided by the unit to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive let your fingers do the walking '' if you do n't tell the unit where to look though it can take quite a while to search for a point of interest i did n't know which city to specify and i did a search for eagle rock rec '' i was too lazy to spell out eagle rock recreation center '' which turned out to be about 175 miles away and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to i later realized that even though i did n't know the exact city the destination was in i did know a city that was near the desired destination when i specified that information the took only a few seconds to find the right location the advanced user can also create your own poi lists complete with custom icons and load those into the i have done this for all burger and krispy kreme locations the advantage to having your own custom pois even though these places are in the poi list is that the custom pois are visible on the map screen at certain zoom levels if you are a geocacher you can do the same with geocaches but you 'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache the newer and more expensive units evidently have the sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive allowing signal acquisition indoors but i found the sensitivity of the to be fine especially since i have limited my indoor driving lately SMILE i have n't tried the under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet so i might change my tune the comparable unit at this price point the lacks the 's capabilities this prevents the from announcing street names since i already have a garmin handheld gps unit as well as garmin 's mapsource topo mapping software i used the unlock code that came with the to unlock my mapsource maps for the unit i then loaded the topo maps for the entire western us onto an sd card between mb and plugged it into the to see what would happen it worked ! so now i have the 's excellent maps and pois for trips topo maps available to me for adventures one thing you should do if you are in the us is enable the unit 's waas capability the default is for waas to be disabled enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range also since this unit has a fingerprints on the screen are inevitable you should use an product like most window cleaners to clean electronic screens it will cause them to fog instead use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes they are cheap and if you do n't use them for cleaning your they might come in handy for i give this unit a highly positive rating i like it ||| 1
this paper works excellent in the hp series printers i have tryed many other makes of photo paper and they just do n't cut it some other makes do n't dry in a timely manner others have a dull finish them some have a red tone this hp photo paper allows you to print store developed quality photos from your hp printer you get what you pay for this product is worth the money ||| 1
i 've used this card for a while now and i 'd say that i like it overall the power usage is great the drivers have been vastly improved and now you are able to scan for networks those of you who are interested in wardriving should look elsewhere if you want to use netstumbler or pocketwarrior in windows or kismet and airsnort in linux either go for the linksys prism based or lucent orinoco based pcmcia card if you 're looking to run just and check email stream music browse the web etc this card will be perfect plus it 'll save you some battery power ||| 1

great quality i had a problem initially with xp media center compatibilty but it works now after downloading an update from logitech 's website recently the sound is cutting out when communicating with my girlfriend across the country i think it might just be her interet connection though we both have the same web cam as long as we restart the video call then the sound comes back i am using windows live messenger as the video call program i have never used the cartoons that it comes with the video quality is very good when recording a video for email ||| 1
the headset works great comfortable i just wish they had better sound quality for instance when playing music ||| 1
i bought these headphones on the recommendation of a friend and he was sooo right ! the moment when the algorithm on a noisy flight is just sublime i frequently use them without input just tuning out the background noise on the aircraft they even work well on squalling a few rows away ||| 1
this amplifier works as stated increased my modem downstream from -7 to +9 no obvious loss of noise ratio and upstream signals all tv channels are much sharper ! the cables came with the amplifier are two cable lines for minimum loss of broadband signals i suggest you replace one of them with cable to carry the cable signals use the for the power supply only ||| 1
if you want very basic capability this is the wireless adapter for you slow but steady and inexpensive ||| 1

people buy expensive av cables because of most people would think that more expensive cables will work better and last longer i 've found that it 's more a matter of quality control i 'll roll the dice with cheap price cables untill they fail on me ||| 1

i installed the roady in my car a few days wife has a xm radio in her new vehile so i was some what familiar with the xm only reason i did n't give the roady 5 stars was that the signal to the indash radio is the front of my in dash stereo there is a aux input which i plugged my roady into and the roady plays crystal clear however this connected is not mentioned in the roady instruction have three vehicles and all three have an aux input on the front of the cd player that i plug my player radio was running a special and i got the unit and the car kit for in all the roady is awesome ||| 1
i have purchased these and other rechargeable batteries in the past generally i like the powerex batteries the best but these energizer batteries have really outdone the others the seem to have the best capacity and last the longest of all the batteries i have i have used them in my canon digital camera and have taken over 400 pictures during a weeklong vacation with no problems and no recharging during the vacation ||| 1
there 's no need to take anybody else 's word for specs on this sony dvd player when you can view or download for free the user 's manual at http mdl i 've been running this sony player through a sony widescreen hdtv and a pioneer for several days now and i find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers one for example states that there is no bass management '' yet you can a route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting small '' or large '' for the front speaker size see page 76 of the user 's manual and also b increase or decrease the bass from -15 db to +5 db see page 77 of the manual whether you prefer analog to digital audio or you think sacd 's are tops is a matter of opinion taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit i for one prefer and i mention this for an important reason some product ads and the user 's manual clearly warn that this unit will not play discs '' happy surprize it most certainly will ! for my 's that have optional dolby 5.1 dts tracks the player simply ignores the primary format normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors but still plays the dolby or the dts via the digital audio optical or coaxial connectors for pure '' 's without dolby 5.1 or dts tracks it conveniently outputs the audio both via the 6 analog and the digital connectors and in all cases above the audio is full surround and not downmixed to pcm nor prologic the only function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on 's and so displays only the jacket image '' onscreen the quick setup allows any dvd newbie to be up and running in a short time and the custom setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and that it 's bound to please even the in short you 'll find this to be a superior universal player provided you read the user 's manual all 84 pages of it ! follow it and connect equally compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features ||| 1
what it has that the does not hdmi of front mains now available during 5.1 playback one extra set of component inputs and stereo called party mode '' on other receivers otherwise the internal components are identical so expect similar performance other words outstanding sq when matched with the right speakers blows away all other receivers under five hundred bucks and most under a thousand see my lengthy review of the for more details boutique audio shops do not want you to know about this product because it 'd put them out of business they make much higher margins selling you receivers costing several times this panasonic 's prices since their profits are usually a fixed percentage of the street price ||| 1
this is the second brother printer i '' ve owned the first died during a storm and i forgot about electrical surges the only negative on this printer is a slight curling of the pages it is fast and reliable the prints are crystal clear i would recommend this product to everyone ||| 1

i 've had my epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent i run exclusively on linux currently gentoo and the linux support for this printer using cups is superb all modes resolutions etc are supported i use this printer a lot for engineering work printing tabloid drawings and it works great for that like just about every review states this printer slurps ink like homer simpson slurps beer because i do n't print many color photos this is not a problem for me if i was doing that i 'd get the niagara system other reviewers cite i 've researched the niagara system and it looks like a good deal for heavy users my main complaint with this printer and the reason why it only gets four stars is the ease with which the heads clog up this printer wants to be used constantly if you let it sit for a day or two it 's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you 'll get streaks in the output then you have to either press the control or in more extreme cases run the utility on linux i use mtink to force the printer to 'blow out ' the plugged jets when the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into a thing will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper that 's when you get out the windex and paper towels and clean up the mess google the web for details because of this 'trait ' i would not recommend this printer for casual users still for printing and photos and considering how well supported it is under linux there 's not much else better out there ||| 1
having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far i can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results the drivers at least for mac os x are easy to understand and reliable the ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing is a vey nice touch as well however it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me by using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings one can get nice rich colors that are on cue thus this printer makes good for doing proofs as an artist and graphic designer having this quality is a blessing since this print cost 400 at the time of parchase compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from 2000 on up also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers the only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 x 11 printer also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey but what inkjet dose n't have that problem anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often so any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job so i 'm giving 5 stars on the epson 128 ||| 1
i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway originally the specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion if you need a cable an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway there are a few very few devices that do use all 24 pins but with the advent of hdmi nobody really makes them anymore ||| 1
product came in as describe super clear picture quality as it 's supposed to be as monster cable brand ||| 1
the sennheiser hd 205 is great value for money the design is not only comfortable but takes out a lot of ambient noise this headphone does not have active noise reduction but does a good job with its closed design headphone the is able to swivel backwards so you can answer a phone call and not need to remove the whole headphone this swivel was designed for dj 's to do sound mixing but works well for other purposes as well i also like its strong bass and great clarity where i could hear sounds in music that i did not hear before this headphones not only works well for music but does great with your favourite action movie you will hear how close the sound is and have bullets whizzing past you and swords meeting like they are just around you below are the technical specifications acounstic principle dynamic closed ear coupling frequency response hz max spl at 1 vrms 112 db thd at 100 db spl 0.5 impedance 32 ohms weight without cable 206 g singnal cable 3 m copper cable ofc 3.5 mm stereo jack with 6.3 mm adapter this headphones comes with a 2 year warranty and a protective pouch for the headphones ||| 1

what a wonderful surprize it took about ten minutes to install them to my hp media center computer they replace speakers that came with my 19 '' monitor which were lousy to say the least speaker make with held but the vs surpassed all my expectations while i am not an audiophile i do admire and expect good faithful sound reproduction and these speakers more than do the job i do n't understand how the more expensive ones can do any better suffice to say i am completely satsfied and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for their moneys worth ||| 1
this was a breeze to setup even with to ensure privacy i also hooked up an and it has never failed in since i bought it about 6 month ago much better value then your average gaming adaptor since it has multiple ports so you can hook up all your gizmos at the entertainment center rather then buying a wireless adaptor for each tivo etc i love it and for the price you could not beat it ||| 1

this is my first time ever buying a really expensive player i bought it three weeks ago if i had n't seen the creative zen vision m i probably would have bought the sandisk sansa i love being able to bring my shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv there is one problem i 've had with it i 'm not sure if anyone else has had this but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when i 'm listening to music i do n't think it 's the because i 've never ran into the problem with my other players if only they would 've added the video cable for the tv and kept the charger then i would 've rated it a 5 ||| 1
earlier this week i received the factory referbished samsung i have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players mainly my philips 642 which have been excellent players for me this model does well i do n't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw note this model has the dvi output if your tv has an hdmi port you will want to check out the samsung hd 850 identical otherwise first this model has component composite and hook ups as well as the dvi port still have to run seperate sound out with dvi also this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 thx many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models the picture quality is great at comparable with my philips again the upconvert works well out the dvi hook up to my tv but to be honest it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good progressive scan player at least on my tv which is a 23 '' lcd menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well the user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing in fact it does not have an index but it the main thing is that the player is does perform well and is a name brand product from samsung i have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems this player also appears to have divx available on it not noted in the product discription so that was a suprise as well this will allow the use of movie files the remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus in all i will continue to explore this new player but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack so give it a chane the prices are good currently quality has been good and it is a samsung note to the technosavy i have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites so i am using my dvi input for upconvert also the new blue ray hd dvd players are out so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this you might want to wait and save till you can get the new dvd players note 2 the factory referbished models come with a dvi cable a dollar value that many do n't come with ||| 1
this was one of the cheapest tv mounts and it had all the options the expensive ones had it will pull away from the wall as well as allow the screen to pivot up and also compacts up close to the wall i dont know what other features someone would want in a mount it is also very smooth when it moves and there is not any deflection or sloppiness in the construction altough i only put a 14 '' lcd on it ||| 1
there is a light that always stays on and it is distracting as others have noted otherwise it is great good design works well no complaints but that light why did they design it with that ||| 1
protects the garmin 's 60 screen from scratches but interferes with the button operations a little worth the hassle to protect the screen ||| 1
this unit works very well and we are very pleased with it nice construction good sound quality on both ends we 're concerned about battery life as in of recharges before performance decreases but no indication right now that is an issue i would have give the product 5 stars if it had been cheaper this class of device is overpriced in general amazon 's price was very good but overall still seems over priced i would definately buy another from amazon as these are 25 more at other places ||| 1
this cable does improve the image quality but not by much i was dissappointed to see very little difference between my standard stock cable and the moster cable i bought this is not to say that the monster cable is bad but it just is n't worth the asking price if you see on for under 20 then i recommend picking it up but other than that just avoid them because there is n't much better out there ||| 1
breaking news if you are buying a new video playback capable ipod please look for the new ipod universal dock which has output for both photos and video it is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your ipod from your sofa is this expensive the answer is probably yes this dock was included on the original ipod photo of late 2004 priced 600 the dock was removed as apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color ipods however for a couple of uses high quality home audio and slide shows on tvs it is a great alternative this dock basically serves three purposes the traditional synch charge function available since the early days it helps you get line '' output out of an ipod line output is a cleaner higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack it is the best way to connect your ipod to a home stereo or home theater the super video out for color ipods this function is something you can not get without the dock so if you like to show your pictures to your friends family using a tv plasma lcd or a flat screen this is a great tool to use as an alternative if you do not want to use and are ok with regular digital video out a cheaper alternative is the apple ipod av cable '' at 19 from the apple store or similar alternatives in summary buy this if you hook your ipod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do slide shows on your tv if you do n't do it it 's just too expensive as a since anything you need is in the ipod box ||| 1
i bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items i need to carry back and forth umbrella lunch spare battery paper etc it 's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally i was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward but it 's not my only minor complaint is that the buckles on the shoulder straps slip gradually and need to be tightened every couple of days ||| 1

my experience with several repetitions the adapter continuously plugged in continuously on works for about 10 days then stops working and drops the connection it wo n't restart the only way to recover is to unplug it plug in your spare you do have a spare of course and let the netgear cool off for a couple of days then you plug it in again and it works for about 10 days ||| 1

i purchased my first roadmate in august 2004. since then i have taken it to various places in north america it 's gotten me out of some tight spaces i 've never gotten lost while using it i purchased the second one when the voice interface on the first failed i sent it in for repair the extended warranty had just run out about 2 weeks earlier the new roadmate arrived in two days and has worked fine ever since the old roadmate was returned to me repaired in about a week i gave the first one to my wife and she has used it with success ever since pros easy to use amazing detail cons sometimes takes a long time to acquire satellites original mount is useless after about a month i got aftermarket tripod for each unit and they seem to work fine software updates are expensive ||| 1
i have case logic cd wallets from years ago that are still in good shape despite the abuse i put them through i bought this one only because of cd collection expansion i find simply wiping off the outside cover with a wet sponge keeps it clean the nylon covers really hold up over time the 128 cd capacity '' refers to cds without their accompaning booklets it 's really 64 cds with booklets ||| 1
this charger is designed for every ipod except the shuffle the shuffle connects via usb this charger uses firewire every ipod charges while connected to a computer via firewire or usb 2.0 but this charger allows you to charge your ipod in a wall outlet in addition to the charger you will need a connector cable you can use the one that came with your ipod or buy a second one hook 'em up plug it in the wall and get on with more important things while your ipod charges for international travelers the plug pops off and you can purchase the correct plug for the country you will be visiting great feature ! i have an ipod dock connected to my stereo and use an extra connection cable along with this plug to ensure that my ipod does n't run of of juice durring parites and long playing sessions i highly recommend the power adapter to ipod users who want the flexability to use their ipod on the road or in conjunction with a stereo ||| 1

i bought these speakers some time back i was a bit skeptical because the sub woofer looked a little wierd but once i plugged it in they sounded really the remote control is really handy if you are looking for nice speakers for dorms or not an apartment these are it are really awesome they go really loud i owned jbl creatures 2 before and i prefer these to my old ones these altec lansings are the best speakers i have ever owned and trust me i have gone through the lot of the ||| 1
i 've been using sbl soundcards for about 3 years i use it for recording live and with sound fonts this usb device is easy to set up and the sound quality is great ! one installation tip initially after i connected it and installed the software i was not getting any sound although the software was installed successfully i rebooted and everything was detected and has worked fine since so just remember to reboot after installation ||| 1
i am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys i bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the 's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out i first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome i could hear things in songs i have never heard before i then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp there was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you i am glad i got these instead of the 650 's cause my friend owned the 650 's and if you do n't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck ||| 1
this little doohickey is exactly what i needed to read my memory sticks load the software plug it into the usb port and you 're off and running ! the mobilemate is super speedy ! the pop right up with no lag time and you can read all forms of memory sticks with this one reader excellent value for the price ||| 1
i 'm very happy with this model i use it mostly as a vcr replacement to record broadcast tv shows you ca n't beat the price for this i 'll try to describe some aspects that are n't mentioned in the other reviews the owner 's manual can also be found online in pdf format it can schedule upto 16 programs it does not support or a program guides you can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus it even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk every menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen the commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which is n't quite granular enough but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well the remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players my only complaint the remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on side when the unit is in our video cabinet the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room we ca n't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and wo n't open if it 's too close to the wall of course this probably means nothing to you at the highest quality setting xp it made a very good near perfect i 'd say copy from a video camera using analog inputs at that setting only one hour of content fits on a dvd the next lower setting sp which can hold two hours per disk the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems most tv shows recorded in ep 8 hrs are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times this is especially pronounced on animated shows the lp setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded tv it also has a option i have n't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality probably would be good for recording a tv movie it 's too bad other vendors have n't adopted the format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media but it wo n't play on most other equipment the other formats seem lame by comparison but this unit can play and record on them watching one show while another is recording or the same show that 's recording but from the beginning is very easy to do most of the operations are very sensible and explained pretty well but you should spend some time in the manual if you 've never had a dvd recorder before it can do a lot of stuff one interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using the signal is sent through the output it ca n't burn music cd 's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add that and a battery backup so i wo n't lose my schedule and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star ||| 1
i purchased the monster cable mp hts 1000 without reading the reviews which i do n't usually do for the simple reason of where i purchased my hdtv samsung they were trying to sell me but for a 150 which was too much i plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound i have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable that connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop after switching around the cables i had a picture again i ca n't really see an improvement in the picture quality hd is beautiful i bought the monster basically for the protection ||| 1
the is the successor to the hp they both accept only a maximum of securedigital flash cards since they only have an approximate operating system file address space only about of the securedigital flash cards a little more on the hp than on the hp are accessible the manuals only vaguely state that they recognice and securedigital flash cards the hp has a black case with a black metallic faceplate the white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the hp red or tomato and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate the black hp looks tastefully geared for serious users they still have no display backlighting or a color display the hp keyboard feels a little more compliant than the hp but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970 's series of the hp hand held calculators ||| 1
the convenience of this product is terrific whenever i show people how it snaps in half they 're amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one now that all computers have usb ports i can put my photos into any computer anytime i want without worrying about the docking station a product for every digital camera ! ! ||| 1
great product it 's two in one you have it in your camera and take photos next you can plug it into the usb port and download data it 's worth the money ||| 1

i am going to strictly comment on the linksys a lot of the reviews on here have been for the vonage service the linksys is not the vonage service but one of many adapters you can use i am extreamly satisfied with my linksys it is small light weight and perfect for those who need to travel the voice quality is excellent and people say i do not sound like i am talking over voip there is no line noise static popping etc i am giving this product 4 stars why because there is only one ethernet port if you have a router just connect the to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go if you do not have a router consider getting another vonage phone adapter with built in router there are several ||| 1
i read the other reviews and do n't understand where they are coming from unless they are all by at t or bell employees i 've had vonage for 3 years and have nothing but good things to say about it i have local numbers for seattle salt lake city boston and san francisco so my friends can stay in touch these numbers only cost me a month customer service is excellent they stay right on the phone with you until everything works perfectly this is especially nice after they added 911 service ||| 1

installation on a normal home network setup is very easy my setup was a little more complex due to voip router and wireless router sling has instructions on their web site but i still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work to work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. once i worked this out everything is great video quality is good in the house have n't tried it from another location i 'm running the sling av with netgear ethernet power adaptors to my router and then watching tv via wireless to my laptop now we can watch tv in any room of the house my wife loves being able to watch the news in the morning while in the kitchen she also loves being able to surf while having a show running in a small window on the side control of my dish dvr is very good we can manage any feature of our box this will come in handy when we travel as we have our sons seaseme street shows on the dvr and now we can take those with us on the road overall i 'm pleased with the sling av it offers good performance at a great price point now sling just needs to get the mac version out so i can watch tv on my beautiful 15.4 inch mac book pro ||| 1
this is a quality built toner cartridge but for the money it should have a great toner capacity ||| 1
i bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint i use it in chicago a lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal not true at all i think the longest i have ever waited was 20 seconds it does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes when i am surrounded by tall buildings wacker but this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna overall this gps works perfectly the is fantastic it is very quick to recalculate my route if i miss a turn and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn you will not be disappointed with this purchase ||| 1
soundwise the klipsch promedia ultra were everything that they were supposed to be the bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted the sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case something to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound the wires themselves are long enough and there should n't be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room one last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only '' plugs for hooking up the sound source if you want optical you 're going to have to go elsewhere please note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality if you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money same goes for music quality if you are listening to an that is below the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding not the speakers if you ca n't spare the hard drive space for its time to get a new hard drive overall these speakers are a great deal while the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies for those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast do n't bother spending the money these speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality if you are more worried about loudness do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers you wo n't even notice the difference ||| 1
it has some very useful addition from the previous model it has cut the time of doing my homework in half ||| 1

this backpack has been such a useful companion for me there are lots of space inside even for huge text books and compartment is arranged just right to hold variety of stuff dvds paperback books pens cell phones water bottles etc there are numerous creative ways of storing stuff indeed my whole life as a student can be inside at once as a notebook backpack this would not provide the best protection padding is fine but depending on how much stuff you have a notebook inside could be squeezed a bit more than you desire also the clip to fix the cover flap onto the backpack almost is broken after a year of daily use for me i have had dell 14 '' and 15 '' laptops with the backpack and fitting was just fine for securely hold it inside wearing comfort is pretty good and things are quite adjustable for your body i would recommend this backpack if carrying more than a laptop testbooks is essential for you i ended up using a warranty support to fix the buckle targus 's customer support is first rate courteous and reliable they actually replaced the backpack with a newer version of the same product their service totally make them highly recommended ||| 1
i had to 'fix ' this ipod holder with a bicycle hand grip to stop it from shaking my ipod i have a decent car and the roads are just ok but this thing shakes and shakes i also put one of those beer coolers around the base of the foam hand grip and its now rock solid oh yeah and it holds the ipod just right too i also put some of those velcro dots on the bottom for a little more security from my cup holder ||| 1
i had n't seen this product in stores as i usually would see the white tunedok which seemed pretty cool but i decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car i have a white generation ipod the holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than i expected it 's very easy to just place the ipod in the holder and very easy to take it off you can do it with one hand you just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your ipod is easily removed and ready to go the additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them but the standard one was enough for me the part that is black and holds the ipod is what seems to be the best thing about the product as far as i know the cups are the same grey color for both the white tunecok and this black version so the difference is only in the ipod holder and not the cups the only bad '' thing i could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily in fact when i was trying to figure out what the adapters were for before reading the i scratched it quite a lot trying to fit the two additional cups together that does n't affect functionality so it does n't make me give it less than 5 stars a small issue you might want to consider as well is that the tunedok does n't hold ipods in their cases so if you 're like me and carry your ipod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the ipod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the ipod on the tunedok i like how the black tunedok looks with my white ipod it kind of makes the ipod stand out more than the tunedok itself i think the 15 price is pretty reasonable for the white tunedok and this one is too if you 're willing to pay the extra 5 for it to go with your ipod but as i said i think my white ipod looks cooler in my black car with the black tunedok anyway edit i bought it for 20 but now it 's 15 one more good reason to get this one i 'm not too sure but it seems like the new ipod fits in the tunedok if they do i bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black ipods is greater than the white one maybe someone who gets their ipod can confirm this so do n't buy this for your ipod unless you 're already sure or can try it before you buy it ||| 1
works better than any other glossy paper i have used with my epson 960 ||| 1
i purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for her hp pavilion notebook pc screen size 15.4 '' ht 1.8 '' wdth 14.1 '' depth 10.4 the bag is for personal use not business and use will be moderate she did want some extra compartments for organization this case has met all her needs it is light weight constructed of durable material well organized her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease she is satisfied with this purchase we would recommend purchasing this case ||| 1
i have owned many sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now the only problem i have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory you run out when you need it most that is why i upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the sony 1 gig actually i carry a spare 1 gig too where ever i go look when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size megapixels per picture which you should always do to get the best possible prints made your camera will need a ton of storage space especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you had n't expected like a wildfire a plane crash a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens you can always resize '' you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space trust me take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected you never know i have tons of pictures that people ask how did i ever get such good pictures of such amazing things i have a helicopter crash police car up a power poll deer in downtown oakland house fire before the fire dept got there tons of wild animals any many more things i saw while i was driving somewhere or walking in a park if you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives ! matching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea no problems ever ! ! the sony memory sticks i have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems they make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer they are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable i have first hand knowledge that products with the sony name on it are first rate and high quality if you want quality buy sony ||| 1
at first the keyboard looked cheap and the keys were in slightly different places than normal but after time i got used to the layout and found that the keys actually work surprisingly smooth it probably helped my game a bit the extra bit on the front of the board did break off after 2 weeks but i did n't like using it anyway ||| 1
i bought this speaker cable because i wanted it to fall in a straight line and hug the walls without curling all over the place this cable does just that i 'm very happy with it if that is your goal too i can recommend this cable regarding the long standing debate of whether monster cable sounds better than cheaper cable i 'm not an audio engineer and do n't have an opinion ||| 1
i 've used the itrip by belkin the tunecastii by belkin and this monster icarplay for getting my tunes to my car speakers this is the best design and works the best of the three i like that it can charge my ipod and that the transmitter itself is inline the signal seems to be decent enough though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static this gets more pronounced the louder you make it i think this is the safest for car use the itrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the ipod so if you 're taking a car trip i live in ny but went to college in mi that 's a 12 hour drive and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust you really ca n't do it safely with the itrip the tunecast is a bit better but that runs on batteries the optional supply that i got for it did n't work also you can tune into any fm station with the buttons which is good but you really only need the lower stations the icarplay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button though i feel limited by the 8 i do n't think going higher would help because there 's more congestion i like the single button because there 's no confusion whether you 're going up or down and you can press the button then easily tune the radio up a notch the other limitation i see is its ipod specific uses dock connector whereas the tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you ca n't use it without a car or something else with that power source but considering i bought it to use in my car it does what it should and does a decent job of it ||| 1
works precisely as advertised none of the complaints in previous reviews hold for my experience specifically battery backup works and sound quality of messages is excellent only negative too many words spoken by the machine and they sometimes seem to overlap ||| 1
we replaced a tape unit with this one and are so pleased no more waiting for the tape to rewind and this one keeps the messages once played until you remove them also very accurate on time we love it ! ||| 1
the things i like most 1. my recorded greetings two greetings allowed and my caller 's messages are clear and clean 2. the unit 's appearance and styling is sleek and modern the controls layout is good with everything in view and accessible on the top my last machine had some of its controls on the sides causing me to have to pick it up and turn it around and around looking for a particular control this machine is better in that respect 3. learning to use it is a very easy and intuitive process especially if you have used other machines the included instructions clearly explain how to use its less obvious features things i did n't like nothing really but some minor annoyances include 1. the electronic accent of the generated voice of the machine was a little hard to understand at first but i quickly learned '' its accent your callers will never hear it after you record your own greeting which will be clear and sound like you otherwise your callers will hear a default message in the machine 's voice 2. i installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into ac removing the battery then plugging in the ac then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally the battery installation instructions and general installation instructions did not indicate any particular installation sequence requirements regarding the battery ||| 1
bought it for my elderly mother who is getting hard of hearing the volume control on each handset has helped her a lot she also says that the clarity from the handset is better than anything phone she 's had before the extra large size base unit dial buttons are also very helpful for her ||| 1
we received our dlp tv stand in record time we had wanted to get it for a new tv that was being delivered that weekend we ordered on i think a tuesday and it was at our office on friday it was in excellent shape and we had no trouble putting it together the tv fit perfectly ! ||| 1

just a note to future readers if you take gemstar up on their offer to upgrade '' this model you will receive some nice new features however what they do n't tell you is that your machine will become proprietary ! all the books you had before will become unreadable and your ebook will only be able to read '' gemstar books in the future this means you are force to buy all future books from the gemstar catalog only ! the new features that come with this upgrade to the 1150 model are hardly worth being locked into one ebook vendor forever the openness of this little model is it 's beauty it 's the last one of it 's kind as all future models are proprietary ||| 1
this was a very highly rated item on cnet at the price i paid for it at amazon it was like they were giving it away ||| 1

of flash memory will not be destroyed at high altitude or dropped short of shattering the memory stick a hard drive as in the ipod that my son has is subject to air pressure shock and temperature domain that a flash memory device will not be subject to because the hard drive spins to lift the heads above the disk moisture from condensation will cause the head to crash if brought in from a cold car and turned on i do not know about the ipod but some larger devices have dew point detector that will not spin up unless the air in the device is at safe temp that 's ||| 1
i am pleased at the sound of these speakers i feel that for the price it was a good purchase the carrying case that is included is a nice addition you can use the included adapter or run it on batteries not only do i use these speakers with my ipod but also for my mac book laptop i do n't need an overbearing sound but these portable speakers are just right ||| 1

i purchased a sony wega 27 inch tv i took advantage of it 's rear component input labeled i connected my sony dvd player with dvd viewing the movie dinosaur bug 's life toy story 1 and 2 and vegas vacation the colors were very vibrant details were dynamic and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution i have viewed these same movies on larger screen hdtv 's such as the pioneer elite and was disappointed glass picture tubes provide a more realistic picture i ca n't imagine that i can do any better for my television than these cables i am completely happy with dvd movie watching on my sony wega with these monster component 3 cables ||| 1
i had a game that would not even play on the xbox because it was so scratched after using the game it works perfectly it is like i bought a brand new game the game was pretty easy to use too ||| 1

i have paired this with my linkysys router and i have not had any problems with either the modem installed without any issues prior to this modem i was using an rca which began having connection problems since the linksys install i have rock solid connection to the internet and a more stable wireless network previously i would expirience intermittant drop outs '' and would have to reboot currently i couldnt be more satisfied has been a good 3 month ||| 1
the product was easy to load onto my windows based computer using windows xp i connected everything as instructed and as soon as i plugged in the tv cable to the back of the modem my internet explorer picked up the signal and put me at the log in page for new accounts of my cable provider the modem comes with both a usb and ethernet adapter port so use whatever way works best for you i tried them both and they appear to work at the same speed i am guessing it all depends on the speeds your cable provide is delivering amazon had the best price on the product if you have the time to wait for their free shipping i ordered some stuff from them in the past and the free shipping seemed to take forever you may want to factor in paying the additional cost for shipping when buying this product if you need it right away the price even with the additional shipping charge is still a little less expensive than best buy the cost difference between buying it at a best buy store and amazon online will not be much and you 'll have to wait a few days to have it in your hands but you get to avoid the drive to the store i went this route paid the extra shipping and waited for my package to arrive if time is not an issue then use the free shipping method and you will discover that amazons price ca n't be beat it is the lowest price anywhere ||| 1
i bought these for my dvd player they work wonderfully ! the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but did n't measure up these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies especially the dialogue the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever for those of us who can not afford 5 speaker digital surround sound i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds ||| 1
i purchased 2 cards for about us 42 for my psp they work i had other sandisk products and dont have any complaints best of all these cards came with the adapter memory stick pro duo to memory stick so i could use it with my videocamera its nice when one company starts addresing the multiple formats problems ||| 1
i just bought a refurbished roadmate 700 a few days ago it took minutes to locate my current location which was totally normal i kinda feared that i would have the gps with the older version 3.2 as some people said earlier but in fact the one that i got is with firmwave version 4.32 the newest version the voice is working good too i am happy with this product even though it is a refurbished one ||| 1
if you go through a lot of aaa batteries this is one of the best deals on the market short of investing in a recharging unit and a couple of rechargeable batteries a very good value ||| 1
a sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop i took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the kensington contour i did n't want to buy a kensington i wanted a backpack making company with a name i knew like jansport or kelty i 've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products i settled on the kensington because it had the qualities i was seeking comfort quality materials and design water proofing laptop padding urban black rugged exterior sophisticated appearance lots of pockets adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket i write and work in media for a living mostly i work at home but once a week i travel to cities this pack does exactly what i want it to do have places for everything i need protect my precious laptop and look hip so now it is a few months later i still like my pack but twice now the hardware has broken the first time it was just the on the little outside pocket it fell off kennisington immediately replaced the pack for free last week at the airport the tab that holds and adjusts the left shoulder strap broke when slung the pack across my back i have n't contacted them yet ||| 1
as a journalist i need to tote around a microcassette recorder with me wherever i went now with the zen 's feature i 'm able to use it to record my interviews and it 's easier to transcribe because of its clear crisp recording quality you can also play files so unlike ipod users there 's no need to convert them in order to view them many might find it a bit bulky compared to the new ipod but with its added features it 's a small flaw that 's easy to overlook ||| 1
so far i used one tape of this pack the video quality is pretty good ||| 1
short review have burned about twenty disks all work perfectly have made home dvds out of them all work in three different regular dvd players that i 've tried very satisfied with them ||| 1
to avoid burning a coaster update the firm ware on your dual layer compatable drive first the verbatim discs seem to have fewer compatability problems than the other brands i 've tried if your home dvd player is not dual layer compatable you may experience some problems it 's normal for the movie to stop momentarily when it switches to the second layer for best results with movies i burn these as slow as possible for data storage they will burn at no problem these discs work as advertised if you 're torn between verbatim and another brand i would opt for verbatim discs they really do work the best ||| 1
the sandisk cruzer ti is the most durable thumb drive on the market i had a cruzer ti before this one i dropped it stepped on it and was just not too careful with it through all that it never failed me i needed an upgrade and picked this one because the was not available it move data fast and the new stuff is very interesting i am not all that used to the stuff yet but i am sure i will start to use it to its fullest soon of mine buy the less expensive usb drives and break them the sandisk cruzer ti is the absolute best ||| 1
i had a small 512 sandisk a while back so when i saw a review for the titanium cruzer in a popular computer mag i decided to upgrade from my lexar so far i 'm very impressed just did a transfer that took 140 seconds i was a big leery of the included software but was pleased to see that if i did n't care for it it was easily removed i have not had an issue with either the software or the drive and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract this is a very good drive and contrary to the negative comments i would encourage anyone looking for a fast stylish practical jump drive to seriously conside the titanium cruzer ||| 1
i am satisfied by the purchase of this targus 15.4 groove notebook backpack since it is super wide comfortable and with many compartments to keep objects apart of the laptop i recommend it to you ||| 1
great buy for a wonderful speaker system works beautifully with my mac mini for great sound would not hesitate to purchase again great contemporary look on my desk so easy to turn the volume up or down either from my screen or the subtle touch control on the creature i highly recommend ||| 1
i recommend these speakers have had them for 3 months now and they are great sound quality is great power converter gets pretty hot though so i suggest putting it on something non flammable do n't think it would catch anything on fire but just to be safe speakers are not super loud but are great if you just want quality sound ||| 1
recently bought a analog big screen tv switched from to component cables there is a big difference the picture looks more film like with component cables do not hesitate to upgrade stay away from cheap wally world brands you get what you pay for the cable i used was monster cable sv ||| 1
i got one of these a few years ago it 's been to several countries on camping trips bicycle trips subways etc etc and held together very well i pop this and the handspring into my pocket and off i go not lugging around a huge laptop anymore the typing is comfortable this is just like a laptop keyboard and while i too have worried about the little popup part where you connect the handspring it 's taken a beating so far i 'm buying another preemptively because i 'll be so bummed when i do eventually manage to break the current one the hinge in the middle is annoying you have to put the thing on a book or other flat surface to hold it in your lap i think that when the new one comes i 'll try to create some kind of deadbolt mechanism to hold the middle hinge when it 's open and then it will be the single most perfect gadget ever ||| 1
let me just preface this review by mentioning that i read many customer reviews here and elsewhere on this product before purchasing it i focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws after using this keyboard for almost 6 months i believe that saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality command pad many reviews bash this feature it is quite a basic pad as compared to some but it gets the job done my only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as during games such as wow and i had no problems whatsoever the rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me the customers who claimed it to be impossible '' and buggy '' seem to be computer illiterate at best and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews possible english illiterate as well if you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad keyboard the quietness response and overall feel of the keys rival any logitech design i am a huge of logitech equipment and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality saitek took a more simple route with this design no lcd screen etc and the price shows it almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of illumination it is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge i would guess that 90 of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved last and probably least comes the aesthetics of course the most subjective part of any review i found this setup to be very sharp looking in the dark the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever is looking for this eliminates the need for symbol illumination although symbol illumination might be a nice touch especially for the keyboard deficient i feel that saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering i have lost some lettering on logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months i 've been using this one although frequency of gaming has fluctuated saitek engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination apparently an oversight on their part i will recap this lengthy review by recommending this keyboard to any capable computer enthusiast who desires a good value ||| 1
upgraded from 19 '' viewsonic crt this monitor is superb ! recommendation go with native resolution enable clear type through display settings and download the monitor drivers from viewsonic xp uses standard drivers not as good as viewsonic 's imo then restart makes a huge difference over settings out of the box ||| 1
i love my shure earphones and up until recently was pretty happy with the foam sleeves however i was constantly having to reset them in my ears when engaged in strenuous activities the first time i tried these triple flange sleeves i thought i had wasted my money later i pulled my ear up and they slid in a lot further and suddenly i was in heaven i get the full sound that i love so much complete with throbbing bass line and the things stay in my ears until i pop them out ! ! these are the perfect complement to a wonderful headset ||| 1
it says the keyboard is supposed to be easier and more comfortable to type with i do n't think it is that comfortable it 's a little hard getting used to so be prepared to hit the backspace a couple of times the keyboard is and uses usb connection there is a usb to converter included overall it is an ok product for the money as it is the cheapest usb keyboard i 've found ||| 1
arrived in time decent quality for the price is a bit difficult to close though as the zip is n't awesome but as i said it 's good for the price ||| 1
works great just like ti should can add more sheets to store more ||| 1
this is a very good skin for 60 gb 80 gb owners it completely covers the entire ipod without sacrificing functionality what separates this skin from other skins it the visor a plastic shield which protects the screen my only problem with this skin is the belt clip it is impossible to remove and difficult to use a better belt clip would make this the perfect skin this is a very good price from techgnet ||| 1
i have this card for a week and what i can tell you is that this card has a quality that i 've never heard from any sound card the sound is so clean balanced and accurrate of coure you will need a good set of spekaers the cmss surround is much better than dolby prologic 2 and dts neo 6 for both music and movies if you plan to connect the din cable for integrated speakers control with the megaworks or gigaworks you should know that it 's not working but creative is going to add support for those speakers in the following drivers i did n't like the new crystalizer sound but belive me you will not need that feature just use good player like winamp mad decoder plug and asio plug for the output i had many sound card like the audigy 2 audigy 2 zs audigy 4 pro esi juli revolution and none of theme even close to this card ! ! ! worth every ! ! ! ! i recommend you buying from amazon beacuse of thier great service and warrnty i could't do that because i am outside usa ||| 1
the belkin cassette adapter was my attempt at a product that would allow me to play my ipod through car cassette deck the first product can you say monster here was crap stopped working properly after two weeks the belkin adapter has performed flawlessly for months now ||| 1
i have long struggled to find the perfect remote the is n't it but its pretty good its no match for my harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls i have 2 both programmed identically for my main ht the cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house the kids can be using one with the and i can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the rf part of the second remote for the price you ca n't beat it all buttons afik are progammable or mappable setting it us is a pain and i had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my tv to do its thing so that is where it looses a star otherwise its a great performer and with the price i do n't mind if my kids use it whereas they are n't allowed to use my harmony 880. if cost is no object then there are better remotes for the price i ca n't find one better ||| 1
only thing i did not care for was the design on the top of the disk other than that these are quality dvd ||| 1
i bought this to replace an epsom printer that refused to print accurate color and an old canon scanner i am very very pleased ! it looks terrific my daughter said wow cool new printer ! '' set up was easy and the printing is fast and absolutely beautiful even in draft mode better yet the cartridges are much cheaper than my epson ones scanning is easy and good too i do n't use fax so ca n't rate that function overall i am thrilled with this printer it was well worth the 180 ||| 1
i received the correct cartridge my calculations for cost per page is only 2 cents per page which is contrary to another reviewer 's claim of 12 cents per page 120.00 divided by 6000 pages equals 2 cents per page ||| 1
if you are like me and dont really care about the best '' sound quality you can possibly have and do n't mind the tiny bit of static keep in mind i live in a city then this is for you its simple it works and im glad that i bought it and that it didnt break the bank i like it ||| 1
i have a gateway and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes enter this targus lapdesk when folded out it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours but wait there 's more ! i had also found my laptop awkward to use at a desk because of the poor ergonomics however i use this lapdesk folded with the adjustable leg to reposition the keyboard to a better angle for typing it also puts the screen at a better height as well the desk also works well folded in half with my laptop converted to tablet mode so it 's a very versatile accessory to go with my versatile laptop i highly recommend it ||| 1
i got the newer model of these with the blue light on the speakers all i can say is that these speakers are worth the money you get what you pay for these speakers have pretty good highs in them bass wise there decent they hit alright and sub decent you pay more money you get a better system you know this system here is n't much money so it is n't going to be the best so there is n't no reason for the bad reviews i think they work really good for the price their tagged at so if your looking for a system with some good highs and decent bass these are for you ||| 1
i recently purchased a pny 512 mb secure digital card from best buy when it was on sale for 29.99 each card i had been given a sandisk 256 mb card for christmas the past year which had gone curropt the pny is so much better and so much cheaper for virtually the same quality or better than my old sandisk i would recommend this product to anybody who is fed up with sandisk or any other high priced memory manufacturer steve ||| 1
this was part of my stereo update i selected this receiver for quality value and ease of operation i matched it up with the sony 300 cd player and a fresh pair of those bose speakers years ago i used to be an audiophile and i now think i 'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby ||| 1
i bought a 32 inch 5 years ago in 2003 when movie i was trying to move it across the room and it flipped face first in the floor mind you i had paid like 200 for sear 's sorry year warranty and it turned out they would n't have replaced it or probably fixed it even though my sister worked there i heard a sickening crash like the picture breaking it still works and only has a dent it the top left i think i got the remote a little wet years ago and it never worked again not a big deal since i have a directv remote but i forgot i even had pip because of no remote from now on if i can afford it i will buy sony only i bought an xplode cd player 2 years ago with no problems except a dead remote that i never use ||| 1
this tv weighs a ton took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire i have owned several sony tvs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that i have had with a 27 '' sony mainly compared this model with the corresponding panasonic tau absolutely hated the tau remote and am very familiar with the sony note that the remote was not the deciding criteria but it was a consideration i have no real complaints about this tv the menu system is nice and the picture very good i do not normally use the speakers so really ca n't comment about their sound this tv has a enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus i tried it once using a dvd as source input and liked the widescreen format that the dvd player provides better than the mode the 27 '' sony that i have has an feature this 36 '' does not and i do miss it i would purchase this unit again note that there is a very similar sony model that has upgraded sound but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire ||| 1
these are amazing products for low freq they 'll really get down word of advise do n't use them for higher bass freq sounds more like a grinding noise after about 75 htz enjo ||| 1
the high speed memory card is the best it is fast and it can store so much data i cant even imagine using all of the memory but the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's over 700 ||| 1
i bought these here and have had the for a little bit now they work great i will buy more when needed ||| 1
no problems the phone there is no mute button and it 's annoying to hit two buttons to i also could n't find a way to change ringer volume but it 's easy to change the ringer melody and there is one that 's really soft the menu is not as intuitive as it could be but overall it works just fine as a phone ||| 1
i really like this mouse it is easy to use and is one of the most comfortable on my hand i have gone through a lot of mice and have finally found the one for me ||| 1
this stand works great for bringing the monitor up to eye level if you want to sit comfortably get rid of back and neck strain this targus stand is definately the way to go and the price is right ||| 1
this monitor stand is worth every penny and considering the price that really isnt that many pennies what a monitor stand does is it raises the monitor to make it easier on your neck to view i have an ibm laptop and i place it on top of the stand with the stand i probably have to look down at most about degrees before the stand i would have to look down at about 35 degrees this does not seem like much but if you spend alot of time staring at a computer screen your neck will be sore buy this stand and your neck will thank you ||| 1
the case itself fits very snug around the ipod and even gives it a better look the only complaint that i have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open and even falls off at times i still give the case a 4 star rating because i am a soldier in iraq and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my ipod clean if a product can keep something clean in iraq then i am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere ||| 1
what can i say it 's a rubber case that stretches over my ipod there 's little room for malfunction white would 've looked better but is n't available through amazon or its merchants without paying more than the product cost for shipping it has little hard clear plastic windows over the screen and dial the dial covering pops open so far several weeks now they work fine without scratching ||| 1
these speakers were purchased for office use and occasionally for on the road they are a great look and compact the sound is decent and should not be confused with higher end speakers they serve the purpose for which they were intended as far as i am concerned as i purchased them to play my nano i do recommend them ||| 1
i agree with most of the reviews here the is a great headset overall the sound quality is great volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent i 've listened to a great deal of music through these babies and i am very impressed imaging is great and i 've actually heard things in the songs that i have never heard before ! it actually shows the imperfections of my and makes me realize that i probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my cds the controls are also simple to use both on the cord and on the pc audio recording quality is great as well i have tried it with dragon and recognition works great with it playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side however ps and bs are a little too hot even though i have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock my biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department i first feel obligated to tell you that i do not normally wear full coverage headphones usually i wear buds so perhaps i just have to get used to it however i feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot even after only 15 minutes so despite my positive review of the sound quality i am going to send these back and try the they supposedly have bigger ear cups which will hopefully translate to more comfort other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the so it is probably just me update i received the set and there is a big difference the sound is fuller and bigger not louder on the also the comfort is much better they do n't pinch my ears like the the cord going to the headset is also thicker which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage if you 're thinking of the i would get the instead ||| 1
i purchased this headset for use with my mac and skype internet telephone the combination is killer i can not compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only but for me the quality is far better than what i have with my phone and it was really as easy as plug and play i wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires i wish that the headset was more sold on the otherhand i have not had any problems with the equipment up to now and the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller which is important to me especially as my hearing starts to deminish i saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone imo this is too complementary for its price and features a good buy and good sound quality but imo this is not an audiophile headphone ||| 1
all 3 kids have a tunebase it works great easy to use it also charges the ipod while we travel ||| 1
i 've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years they 've included koss the plug '' sennheiser koss koss sportapro and a few others all had their strong and weak points so far this has been the closest i 've had to a good balance for my tastes not necessarily anybody else 's strong bass is one of the most important things the felt very weak in this area despite what everybody else seemed to say weaker than my old sony which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability i had problems keeping the plug '' sealed in my ears despite the hold the outer ear while the plug seats '' advice they 're also a very a bad choice for ipods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit the sportapros had great bass but leaked way too much sound the had good bass and very good isolation but were a little uncomfortable warm heavy and too bulky to use on the go going back a few years i had a pair of akg that had disappointing bass ditto for a pair of sennheiser the seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones the bass is among the strongest when i listen to the 1812 overture the cannon blasts '' come through loud and clear even at moderately low volumes with no distortion at all isolation is n't as good as the but not too bad certainly a lot more portable easy to stow in my bag at all times the fold smaller but they 're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case the higher efficiency of the means i can set my ipod at a lower volume instead of of max volume with the or the stock earbuds i now run at comfortably in terms of comfort they 're comfortable enough for hours of wearing after a couple of slight modifications if they press too hard on your hears first extend the headband all the way then gently straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it after a few tries it should be perfectly fitted to your head do n't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones be patient so it takes a couple of days of trial and error but in the end you get phones that are wonderfully comfortable you 'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal you 'll know if you 've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass here 's an easy test with a finger on each side press the earcups harder onto your ears if the bass does n't get stronger as you press the way it does with all headphones that 's as good a seal as you need i hated the little square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off all they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head other phones with similar headbands like the koss do n't use these pads so i do n't think they 're really necessary better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct it has been far more comfortable for me without the pads especially after more than half an hour in fact without the pads i barely feel the headband at all overall i 'm satisified especially at its low price point i hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along by the way do n't be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the us and canada read the whole warranty sheet ! a separate section on the sheet covers a limited warranty for these countries so yes it is covered ||| 1
i had been wanting a nice color gps unit for a while my wife purchased this one for me and i love it i purchased the city select maps to use with the autoroute system it would be nice if the maps were included with unit i 've had it out on several caching trips now and it has n't let me down yet make sure you take the time to read through the instruction book so you will know how to use the many features that the unit has ||| 1
this is a overall convient carrying case it does not scratch you ipod in anyway this is a great case for jogging or everyday use it has a belt clip that works very well great and simple case i highly recommend it for everyday use ||| 1
this is a wonderful product the surround effect is phoenomenal and i just love it the extra 50 is worth it for the quality sound that it delivers ||| 1
i initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the sony because of its five which make it a to use while exercising however the perhaps because of its analog tuning suffers less from and adjacent channel interference on fm it 's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin with this in mind i purchased another yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it i literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed i was having so much fun scanning the fm dial there was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured 12 '' remixes of eighties new wave hits with blessfully very limited commercial interruption over the course of a three hour listening session i gradually cranked up the volume as i was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds it became apparent that with audio at very loud volumes the 's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality i understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output therefore there will be no audio clipping nevertheless the sound quality from this walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding the party is literally in your head and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses i also made one pass through the am band and there the was no slouch either i hauled in 1200 woai san antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me though no true dx machine after all how could it be it is at the least a competent performer on the am band as well i suspect early in the evening am dxing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time for more on this model and others visit xin feng 's website i highly recommend this model for cheap thrills ! ||| 1
a good basic radio not digital tuning but it works fine reasonably good reception ||| 1
i bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because i trust toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average overall i am very satisfied with the product we have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained we have n't had any problems with the mechanics of the player we also bought a case which i highly recommend so that we have enough baby einstein to keep her happy to our destination also the battery has never run out and charges quickly my only problem with it is that the volume does n't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner but my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway so it was n't that big a deal for us ||| 1
this dvd player is great for the road and even at home when you do n't want to be bothered unless the are much loud noises happening around you the players ' speakers work fine it comes with all of the accesories you 'd want including a car outlet wall adapter remote and the battery it charges in under 4 hours and plays for over 3 hours the player is sleek and so is the battery but together are a bit bulky not bad screen quality is good great for a portable made of good quality materials i 've had it for a month and nothing is showing signs of a recommended accessory to purchase is a carrying case which will haul all your that are included i bought the targus sport which is great also for 160 bucks it 's well worth it ! ||| 1
i do not have a hearing problem but my previous cordless phones were inaudible even at high this phone fills the bill at least so far ! the only caveat no speakerphone which would be handy considering the amount of time most of us spend on hold ||| 1
this car kit works very well the screen is a bit larger than other dvd players of similar type the only down side is that the battery only charges for about 2 hours shorter than many movies so if you are going to use this in the car you need to be able to charge it ||| 1
we bought this unit from sam 's club right before a trip to disney world 8 hours in the car with a toddler eek ! however it perfect ! we still use it for trips around town when we 're in massive traffic or our son is being really fussy the case that keeps the dvd player on the back of the seat needs a little work but we figured out a way to make it work for us also the remote does n't work well but we do n't really need to use it as a dvd usually lasts long enough between stops ||| 1
the cable was a good price and it fit my printer perfect worth the few pennies i paid ||| 1
these speakers are great for the common traveller and have great clean music the only reason i did not give this 5 stars is because it doesn t fofill the height of volume i wished it is pretty loud but i like really loud i do not own this but one of my friends does i hoe to get i station for my ippod it seems awsome according to the reviews ||| 1
these speakers are not what i had expected from their size price and looks their quality even at high volumes exceeds many other speakers i 've seen at double the price tag the reason i bought these was because of the other reviews and the size another reason was the proposed battery life 35 hours on 4 aaa batteries not bad at all so far its been very close i have heard the other speaker systems and yes the jbl onstage and the bose sounddock are both very good and do live up to their reputations but your stuck with using them only when there is an outlet nearby ||| 1
i spent a lot of time reviewing toaster ovens to replace our 8 year old delonghi alfredo one most of the others had features or bad enough reviews that made me pass on them however with the review and cuisinart name i chose the it toasts it bakes it looks nice and it has the knobs that my hubby likes in lieu of digital overall it 's a great oven and we have no complaints with it 's cooking abilities or the sturdiness of the unit but less than a month later one of the knobs broke off the unit they are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening my hubby sent an email to cuisinart and they are sending a replacement knob but one would have expected better engineering from a name like cuisinart ||| 1
when we needed speaker systems for a batch of new workstations price was the main consideration the price for these units was well below budget since our main application for them was for cat computer assisted training high fidelity and volume were not issues they worked admirably for the purpose the use of a usb port for the power supply was a clever twist one of my aggravating support woes is keeping speaker power adapters matched up with corresponding speakers i had been buying unpowered unamplified units with no manual volume control the usb trick gives me just what i want ||| 1
i 've purchased several logitech mice cordless optical and i 've been satisfied with all of them except for the battery life i had to change the batteries in my previous mouse once a month this new logitech mouse is terrific it 's been several months and i have not had to change the batteries yet and i am not even using the switch i want to test the battery life without the switch first battery issues aside the mouse is smooth light and accurate it was simple to install and i 'd buy it again in a heartbeat ||| 1
this stereo works great and its cute and small so it doesnt take up alot of room it lights up blue when u turn it on in the dark and i love the remote now i dont have to get up to switch the station ||| 1
i bought this headset and i must say it 's a great buy first off it 's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams it 's small which definately helps when your wearing it around at times it 's like you do n't even feel liek your wearing anything exactly how a headset should be i 've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires the only problem i have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones but that a small price to pay for such a great inexpensive headset like this one ||| 1
i was looking for comfy earphones to replace my phillips one i got awhile back cos the rubber coating had fallen off and i stumbled on this one i was a bit skeptical about the volume control thinking it would give out after a few times of sliding up and down but it works wonderfully and is so light and responsive to touch as well as being sturdy i started out using the foam that came with it but that proved to be a bother and pretty much useless as the plastic earbuds are comfy enough and they stay in your ears like glue no more readjusting and i loved that for the price this so worth it ||| 1
i bought these earbuds for the first time 3 years ago for 15 now u can get them for under 10 they last more than six months of hard wear and tear before they need replacing awsome i 've been using them for a long time and do n't plan on changin ||| 1
lenmar is great to work with when beach audio will not do exchanges for faulty equipment beach audio told me i would need to purchase another one then when they get the faulty one back they would refund my money for the second one that i had to purchase poor return policy so i just sent it to lenmar under the warranty and they sent me a new one only took one week to get it go lenmar i 've been able to watch on a portable dvd two movies on just this battery with a little to time to spare ||| 1
i really likethe design on this protector and bought 3. it allows you to plug multiple transformers in and still have room for regular plugs slipping plus in is a firm push but not that tough i also like the fact that it gives you a warning light if you get up around 12 cool but you have to keep in mind a 15 amp circuit shoulld n't have 12 amps to one the cord restraint system slides out to hold all the cords then wedges backin to hold them in place a bit hard to set up and a zip tie could achieve the same thing altough this is way easier if you change things ||| 1
overall i like this surge protector and would buy it again i bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets six of which are spaced out to accommodate big transformer plugs i did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration and this unit always came up it has worked just fine for the month or so i 've owned it i particularly appreciate the angled plug which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem i only have two quibbles with the apc the color and the stiffness caused by the safety shutters plugging and unplugging cords requires some force to overcome the safety shutters which could be a problem if you are trying to get something plugged or unplugged while the unit is in an awkward position or location on a much more minor note the black unit and cord stand out quite a bit against walls and carpets even when tucked behind a desk i do n't use the phone or coax plugs so i do n't know if my unit has the problem or feature '' other reviewers have reported with internet signal degradation ||| 1
my has performed well in the time that i 've had it my family members have found it easy to use as well i was saddened at the early demise of my epson which suffered from a common problem of dried ink clogging the feeder tube i chose the canon after reading good reviews and i got it for an excellent price right here on amazon plus free shipping it still sells for more at my local office depot and best buy in truth i have n't tried all of it 's claimed capabilities but i 'm happy with what it 's been able to do thus far ||| 1
i use this in my videography business primarily for weddings so far i 've never had a problem and the mic has always given me a clear recording of voices from a lapel position i use it in conjunction with my to record the sound directly and it 's worked like a dream recommende ||| 1
these 2.0 speakers sound great and not just for their size are adjustable small and good looking i 'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when i turned the volume up so i could understand human speech i 'm happy i spent the money these are real quality in my opinion ||| 1
i recently bought an altec lancing headset for 20 and it was the worst headset investment i 've made horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two so i bought this headset and i have been quite pleased with it the mic output is extremely crisp while talking with clients they said that it sounds like i 'm talking on the telephone with them or better they are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing all in all a good headset ||| 1
works good for me some time one can hear some interference but over all a pretty good product ||| 1
this product is awsome i intalled it on my car with a sony stereo system i placed the end of the ilink cable inside of a compartment of my car so i could put my ipod in the sound quality that the cable delivers its outstanding besides it does not look like a cheap cable it has a thick rubber coating that gives it some stiffness if you are realy thinking on connecting your ipod to your home or car stereo this is the right solution ||| 1
i 've been using this cf card on my nikon 4300 for a couple of months now it writes fast compared to my other cf canon stock from another camera however start up of the camera takes longer because of the size and as more pictures are stored there is a noticeable degradation in speed in writing i 've also used this on a dell axim and it worked great ! no problem in formatting ||| 1
i 'm still discovering the power of this program at least when teamed with the garmin auto routing waypoints detailed maps assistance in finding the nearest gas station the list is nearly endless i 've recommended this combination to several of my friends who are also consultants and who operate in a broad geography ||| 1
well i have used cassette adapters till i heard this one only words that i can say is you have to hear it to identify the difference i have been using it with my cd player and also with ipod with others i had to make sure that the volume on ipod was 100 but with this one hey 85 is too much well i showed it to 1 of my friend and he also loved it and took mine and told me to get another do n't hesitate to buy this one ||| 1
i bought this from amazon for 15 and it works great with my car audio it is easy to use and working fine till now the audio quality is decent and surely recommend this ||| 1
there are lots of reviews here and most appear to be relative to my experience with these headphones but here are my 2 cents i got these to replace some aging sony 's that i purchased maybe 10 years ago the ear cushions of the 's had begun to deteriorate and i figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years i just compared them to the older and i can say that the is definitely better they fully surround the ears just sat on your ear pressing on them the also seem to offer more detailed sound i concur that they sound a little bright but i can take care of this on my ipod by setting the eq to reducetreble but i like the brightness so sometimes i do n't do that i do not concur with other review comments about weak bass they appear to have the right amount imho it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade at the expense of flatness and of sound i also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good plenty loud for me with the ipod and i listen at good levels albeit not ear damaging ones as a last comment i notice amazon has these for about 65 i paid 99 at a local store buy from amazon ! no i do n't work for or invest in them ||| 1
i bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them and i agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat uncolored sound with tight but not boomy or overpowering bass by the way i 've owned the sony 's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion these have been used by musicians studio engineers and on air talent for 20 years now ||| 1
the razor diamondback is awsome no problems with install and great sensetivity when doing everything ||| 1
although there are more expensive options if you 're just looking for something to keep your ipod from sliding all over in the car the isqueez is a great option i use this with the monster icarplay fm which uses the dock connector i ca n't get my ipod mini to fit all the way down in where it should because of this but it still fits in there well enough to stay in place i find that it holds the ipod at a great angle for viewing the screen from where you 're sitting though i 'd recommend putting the passenger in charge of finding music ||| 1
this player is very convenient for long trips if you want to save the money you can get it free from this web site ||| 1
i 'm a section editor at a high school newspaper and i have used this drive every day both in that class and in all my others for over a year and it has never let me down it 's small sleek and elegant and has a quick transfer rate the only issue is with the caps ans skins which get annoyingly loose over time i carry it around on a little pouch on my keys that i keep on my belt loop when i pull it out of the pouch it will sometimes pull off the cap and skin it 's a minor annoyance for an otherwise great flash drive i just went out and bought the version and i use them both ||| 1
awesome product for the price you need to get a small ring like from a key fob from a car to use it on your own key ring ||| 1
good sound quality for the 150 per pair price tag easy to install ||| 1
i ca n't believe the unbelievable prices of flash drives these days i just bought this one from for 20.00 dollars that 's way cheaper than on plus i 've noticed that has switched to third retailers and some do n't even ship to hawaii or do ship to hawaii at a hefty price this switching of amazon having the lowest price to third retailers is really turning me off possibly even towards purchasing books ||| 1
small convenient and classy i love the netgear phone yes it is n't perfect but due to the uplink with skype they can update the software in the phone i 'm hoping they will be able to make the phone more compatible with starbucks and hotel that would make the phone perfect in the meanwhile i 'm enjoying making phone calls all hours of the day to my friends round the world ||| 1
it certainly did excellent color qualit ||| 1
after i read some folk 's horror stories i was really reluctant to purchase this device well it took me only 5 minutes to configure the and another 10 minutes to find the best place for it in the house it was really simple and it worked well with our wireless cable modem excellent product ||| 1
i 'm not entirely sure how other people are finding ways to damage their earphones but i have used the same pair since the summer of 2000 purchased from amazon and i have never had any difficulties besides losing the essential earpiece covers which were easily replaced when they are wound up in their little yellow case the headphones ' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that do n't offer such security compared to other headphones i have used especially noise cancelling of both active and passive varieties these phones have superior bass response and all levels of sound seem reasonably clear i have used these earphones with many different devices over five years cd players players including ipods pocket pcs desktops and notebooks they always sound great except due to their greater sensitivity to sound i often am able to detect the hiss caused by poorly designed audio hardware which i otherwise would n't hear with phones pocket pcs especially seem prone to this as their audio hardware is crammed so tightly in with noisy backlit screens and processors ||| 1
unit performs well is reasonably fast and has security software that will allow the setting of a password if you choose this option loading each time upon insertion is a little slower and you must 'stop ' the unit prior to removing it when operating under the password protection the few times i have forgotten i 've not lost any data but it scolds me for doing so upon the next use ||| 1
purchased the unit because there was n't a tele jack near the thus far has worked a hitch connected to my direct black box to show caller on the screen ||| 1
these cables are super with my new dvd player there is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment the picture is soo clear and vivid the cables themselves are really made well they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt if you get these monster cables you wo n't be sorry ||| 1
i purchased my itrip about 4 months ago and now can give an objective review of the product the itrip is a good choice over competitors ' products and offers a good value for the money radio reception is good i especially like the changing channels feature the fact that it charges the ipod while in use even makes it better the only negative thing that i 've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the ipod slot and i have to push it back that 's mostly due to rattles and i imagine will get worse with time overall good product good value for the money and if carefully handled will last a long time ||| 1
i bought mine about a week ago and i have n't had any problems with it the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it 's a little hard to plug in take out but other then that i 'm 100 pleased with it it 's not cd quality but it 's very close good buy ||| 1
this review concerns the '' hardware and firmware i did not purchase from amazon for the most part everything works pretty well i have discovered a bug where the log is not cleared after a out which leads to strange behavior for the function i can always go into the to view or clear it with no problem another thing to note regarding the log is that vpn not has its own separate log area which does not get emailed out as expected netgear support is mediocre level 1 support can only handle very simple issues and level 2 support is very slow i recommend you use the area of the my netgear '' website so you can more easily to support incidents for those of you using the model this is basically the same thing with vpn service minus the printer port i figure after a few more firmware revisions this will be a really good unit ||| 1
the navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on our toyota highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well the ique was able to hold signels with no problem i think the suction base might be a better solution for cars with out a low flat dash area ||| 1
i love the ishuffle it does the job not many features but makes my commute livable i put all my podcasts up top and list the songs in alpahbetical order by artist name so all is organized it 's like flying blind but who said blind was impossible certainly not helen keller ||| 1
i just thought people should know that you can by the shuffle from apple and have it engraved and shipped for free for 79.00 everyday price so amazon is not really offering a great deal here ||| 1
this is the best device i have bought for at least a couple decades i am a degreed engineer and i love gadgets just the best i have had it about 3 months and i love it attractive base all the connections removable speakers picture quality is among the best lcd that i have viewed i highly recommend it ||| 1

it does n't have spectacular bass power but i am happy for the product i got at such a feasible pric ||| 1

i have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year i have been very happy with them and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup the good they are not only but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear blocking more noise if you put them on without any audio source in only dulls background noise but i think that 's the best you can expect from any pair while listening to audio nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it there is a neck strap with the component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side you put it around your neck like a necklace put the buds in your ears and use the power and volume controls on the piece the bad nothing is actually bad '' about them but they 're not quite perfect the earbuds will easily slip out if you 're sweating or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax however they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds i do this daily when i use them however that does n't make them the best solution for walking or jogging once one starts slipping it generally wo n't stay in well until it and your ears have been cleaned which detracts from the effect other thoughts the cord is plenty long enough to reach an ipod or whatever at about belt level however if the player is in a pants pocket it could be a little close also i often wear it when i 'm not using it because you can forget it 's there and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled i had an issue once because i was sitting at a desk and it dangled to the floor when i stood up i stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring i began to get a slight buzz in one ear however i blame myself for that it was a mighty tug i bought mine at target where they were labelled 24.99 on clearance '' from 49.99 a couple of months later they were back to 49.99 once they dropped again to 34.99 another clearance '' price i bought a second pair as a backup i 'm glad i did i 'm still using the second pair battery life is great i do n't know how many hours i get but i can go at least a couple of weeks using my ipod for at least a couple of hours per day listening to podcasts and audiobooks ||| 1
works great in my cingular 8125 phone i ca n't believe how inexpensive these have become ! more space than i 'll likely every need and no speed issues noting that the 8125 is no speed demon itself i ca n't attest to this product 's performance in something that 's inherently faster ||| 1

this phone has excellent voice quality including in conference mode the only reasons it does n't get 5 stars from me is that a it is unable to operate if there is a power outage as opposed to perhaps just losing some of its functionality just make sure it is n't the only phone in your home b there is a bug which occasionnally renders it unable to operate i ca n't figure out what causes it it may be my cats that walk on it at night and press a weird sequence wit their paws SMILE the only cure i have found is to pull the power plug which reboots it ||| 1
amazon has a nice price on the jbl duet speakers july 2006 36.95 dealmac is a site i used and returned to amazon i purchased these for my office desk where i wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening anything from ambient to rock and jazz they produce sounds nicely nice tight crisp if these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers as the alone do not produce any significant bass at all just the hints '' of bass in the music but no thud if that 's what you are hoping for i did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good these are perfect for offices and just daily music sound is superb not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks build quality is ok '' i got the white speakers and they are the nice mac '' white plastic the jbl logo on the speaker itself is awfully big and the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky one of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these meant to not scratch your desk did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on the design is very modern and cool tho they look nice on my desk you will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully break in they sound awful right out of the box and after maybe one hour of keeping these on they will sound better on the low end of speakers out right now these will probably sound the best and are most modern design compared to the black boxes out there ||| 1
i bought this laptop stand when i found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so i could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them so now i have the center of the screens at the same height it is really nice to have twice the screen i figured that mostly i would put background stuff on the laptop screen like email and use my big screen for what i was activly working on but now that the laptop screen is up at eye level i tend to use it just as often as the big monitor ! it turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it even though i was not aware of that until i got it raised ||| 1
one of the least expensive ways out there to raise your computer screen to eye level i am so when i sit i am still pretty high in the air with this stand i am able to sit with great posture and look straight ahead to my screen i would definitely suggest getting one of these if you 've ever thought about raising your monitor up off the desk ||| 1
i 'm overly critical of sound quality at home i have the tritton surround sound headset running off optical connection this doesnt ' compare to that but the tritton is 99 too for the this is really nice sound microphone and wire quality are all good controls are easy to use and the software is easy to use too they 're also fairly comfortable good headset for work ||| 1
i love this printer i purchased it to print from my digital camera the ink does n't fade over time like my hp did ||| 1
as you may already know this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these panasonic models the panasonic does not need or use a telephone jack it simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above this phone was also very easy to register it had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered i simply had to press the mute '' button on my base unit and then press the play '' button on the phone the registration directions were even displayed on the lcd display on the phone ! please know that i did find the panasonic instaltion directions to be a little confusing some features that are not mentioned in this description which are included are finger sizing on the sides of the phone the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone the base unit to the has a digital answering machine and i suspect the other panasonic models do as well this was the main reason why i purchased this phone yes the will play your answering machine messages off this phone through the speaker on the back of it ! ! ! a separate call waiting '' dedicated button is also included also this phone will use any standard headset it does not need a panasonic branded headset this was very important for me because i ofen use a headset and i do not want to purchase another one i have since learned that all cordless phone headsets can be used on any type of cordless phone ! please know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the system that is the model that i have also the phone ca n't be charged in this charger and vice versa that is likely because the phone is slightly smaller and weighs less the face of the phone is white with a purple trim the back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half the white '' in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white and the purple '' is not shiny at all some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the model and the lcd screen is not flat it is indented slightly and bordered in silver i purchased this phone from an merchant and am very pleased with it i noticed that another merchant is selling the same phone that i purchased for less 30 however that merchant has horrific feedback and i was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that i would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work ! panasonic makes very good phones the only big problem is the battery life the batteries often die after less than 90 minutes i have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries however this is still not a perfect solution so i had to purchase another set of cordless phones uniden i now keep two phones in each of the rooms that i had each of the panasonic phones and so far have not run in to any problems i hope panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon all in all this is an excellent phone i hope the extra details that i provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision rarely provides specific details to these types of questions does only employ braindead dimwits and the panasonic website does not offer this info ||| 1
i recently bought an hp 17 '' widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling this case is all that and more on one side is a detachable cell phone case the other side a hidden drink holder it has a pocket that it slides into if not that came in handy in the airport this case looks extremely sturdy well built ! and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it it holds my 17 '' laptop pda cell phone computer mouse cameras ipod and all the wires and chargers for those electronics i even fit two books keys a folder filled with directions and plane tickets a notebook and two dvd 's in here all of that at the same time granted all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form the strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony the strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if i wanted but it is not detachable which means it is n't likely to fall off easily this bag is extremely there is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats very well knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay ! of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding because this bag does all that and more it is large it becomes larger the more you stuff it obviously however i am '' and i carried it fine from north carolina to new york it looks great if i needed to go to a meeting with my laptop i would gladly take it in this case it looks professional enough happy buying ! ps let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17 '' laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible also in the stores i checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon ! ! if you have a smaller laptop this case will work just fine too ! it has an adjustable divider you will just gain more room for other stuff i look foward to long usage of this case ||| 1
very reasonable price and a must have as a spare for those that leave affixed to windshield fast shipping a great shopping experience ||| 1
i 've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget i 've owned mine for about three years and i love it i use it nightly the application i find this perfect for is audio books stored on this of one of the only small portable players that has it 's own speakers i go to bed listening to audio books and i do n't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around however just slightly larger than a cd walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines the big gripes i 've seen repeated in the other reviews are 1 poor radio reception 2 no bass from the mini speakers 3 short battery life 1 i never use this to listen to the radio so i wo n't comment on it good or bad but there are thousands of good and cheep radio 's on the market so if you need a radio go buy a radio 2 i 'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers small cone 's yield small bass it 's a physics thing however when i travel and use this to play music in a hotel room it 's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music 3 battery life i 'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers i get about hours of use when i 'm on the road using the aa 's when at home or in a hotel the ac adapter removes the concern about battery life completely perhaps this is because i primarily play disks which it spins up to read into it 's buffer then spins down until it needs more data anyway i wanted to toss in my two cents as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners and i would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a walkman sized it 's my hope that we 'll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit but bottom line i 've got my monies worth and if anyone does n't want theirs i 'd be glad to take it off their hands ||| 1

i had bought one of these five years ago when i was in the states and am still happily using it at home unbelievably durable for a mouse pad heavily used for hours everyday for five full years fed up with giveaway mouse pads sliding with my hand movements i was searching for something decent to use in the office and amazingly found the exact same item it is a good example that how little things make a big difference ||| 1
i bought this ipod to replace my one that got stolen and chose more memory as the got filled up too quickly can say that this is probably the best size in terms of memory otherwise as usual with macs very easy to use even for people like myself beautiful design small and light not too fragile just great on the go ||| 1
just what i expected good quality convenient and holds lots of musi ||| 1
i researched cases upon receipt of my 20 gb ipod and deemed this the best this case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear hard shell the hard case protects the ipod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs it also does not obscure the screen an enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit this case is not compatible with a bose sounddock as the user must remove the ipod from the case also contour design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves i spent 5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case the price seems high for a couple pieces of plastic but a case is essential and this is the best one for the 20 gb ipod ||| 1
it 's great if you have high speed enabled devices it 's very fast a is sufficient for almost purpose ||| 1
i 've had this controller for over a year now and it still works great and reliably as ever after many months the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little but a quick jiggle and they 'd be back to center the profiler software is excellent allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse this allows you to play any game with the controller even ones which do n't naturally support gamepads like splinter cell with the shift '' profile function you can effectively double the number of buttons which i found great for playing a complicated flight sim like alliance completely keyboard free using only the gamepad only downside the is hard to control precisely it 's difficult to press only up down left or right you almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead this made the more or less unusable for games like street fighter but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway ||| 1
first i should say that i 'm surprised at how sharp and clear the image is the display card at compusa said this monitor has a contrast ratio and i 'm not sure what that means but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture the contrast ratio is higher than most other i looked at which have a contrast ratio of around to including samsung 's own 20.1 '' model everything is which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies it is also good for gaming 2 and unreal tournament 2004 for example both look great its resolution of is more than decent for most tasks it also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to which makes a square picture centered on the screen so if you have any games or other applications that do n't support widescreen modes you can use mode so that the picture does n't look stretched and distorted plus the monitor has dvi analog vga and rca inputs which would allow you to plug in a dvd player if you want the monitor can also rotate 90 degrees and it has speakers and a headphone jack being a display it is also lightweight and compact which is ideal for areas where space is limited this is my first display and i was surprised at how lightweight it really is all of these features especially the sharp image make this a great monitor and it is worth the money ||| 1
this was a defective unit got new unit and it works as expected ||| 1
the den of horrors that is the magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord if you do n't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your gps and that is no fun at all i have used mine for over six months and it works without a hitch a nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you do n't have excess cordage lying around your dashboard right now i loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again i never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism others may run into this problem the alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles a minor hitch but not earthshaking ||| 1
pluged it in and good to go i skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that went to the admin screen a little overwhelmed with all the features it could be more stremlined for a novice user they would be entirely lost perhaps that is whats on the install disk easier setup but my experience self got through just fine enabled the maximum security features more so then the easy setup button which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments heard lots of issues was weary but out of the box works great no issues no dropped connections and for that reason since it works i do not intend to flash the firmware to the latest as the saying goes if it isnt boke do n't fix it btw home network is a mix of print server wired pc wireless apple powerbook everything running smoothly ||| 1
i 'm glad that i bought the carry case with my garmin etrex because it has kept it clean and easy to hold and carry i have n't used the belt clip yet but i liked that option ||| 1
after reading the online reviews of this product the portable product i went with this one portability is not much of a need i plan on being around a power outlet the sound is in line with a box of the same size and it 's about the same weight i have a lot of trees around my house so i have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit i have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and i can hear it all over the first floor of my home so far i 'm happy that i bought it ||| 1
i was surprised at the sound quality of this small speaker system i purchased it to use in my bedroom on my nightstand and am very pleased you can hear the music in several other rooms if the volume is turned up without distortion i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend the speaker system to others ||| 1
this case is a veritable dirt magnet it attracts more lint than i ever knew existed on my desk however it protects very well one thing i was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen however it does n't even touch the ipod also i worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel while it is n't quite as sensitive it makes it more precise in my opinion seeing as how i all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when i wanted in the s range without the case on this blue case even looks good on my black ipod even though i was worried the color would appear muted it 's still vibrant one complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button truthfully this does n't bother me because i have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button but those without could have a great deal of difficulty also the hole for the headset is n't quite large enough and sometimes my headphones will pop out i 'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod so i do not know how those would fare overall it 's a great case that you wo n't lose your grip on it protects well and you never have to take it off even to plug it in i would recommend it though it is a bit pricy in a bit of an update with this case on my ipod survived a ferret attack with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case i think this case is well worth the money my ipod could have been destroyed but it 's perfect ||| 1
printers have gotten inexpensive let 's face it the game is cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills i 'm fine with that for the 149 amazon price this machine actually do everything i need it to a fax machine for those rare occasions i need to fax a physical piece of paper a great inkject that does n't consumer much ink it copies and scans i have used every function am pleased with them all sure it feels a little flimsy it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office however it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months so that flimsiness is n't really even a complaint and i work from an office in my home three weeks out of each month so i am more than glad i can reproduce all the functionality my real '' office provides me all in all worth the money ||| 1
we bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago one handset gave us problems from the start but was promptly replaced when returned for service the system works fine in our sq home i did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house as a test i took the handset down the street about 100 yards away it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street i like the features including paging system call transfer and handset speakerphone being able to have a phone at any outlet location is a big plus i think the sound quality is very good and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive i agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag overall i feel it works as advertised and we 'll be using it for a long time ||| 1
i bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it ! it has great sound quality i love the features it has such as speakerphone caller id and it 's phone directory the only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people both directories oher than that this is a great phone i have owned panasonic and ge cordless phones in the past and had problems i even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone ||| 1
amazon attempted to extort second payment for undeliverd items claiming they would refund late ||| 1
this fm transmitter is the bomb diggiti ! ! pros the clarity it great and the fact that it has a long neck makes it the best ! pros if you own a chyrsler pt cruiser you will love this device the neck brings the ipod even with the top of the steering column so it right into view on the right you do n't have to look down or fumble for you in between the seats pros very stable once it is in the outlet pros great reception ! cons would be nice if it had a switch on the base for those outlets that stay on even when the car is off the green light on the device my attract unwanted attention cons i have to take off my protector everytime i use the ipod in my car ||| 1
on the plus side it 's a great value for the games that do work on the simcity alone is probably worth the price on the down side although amazon claims it 's compatible with the tungsten series '' that was probably written before the came out four of the games appear to act as trial '' versions although it 's impossible to enter the registration codes see for an explanation even with only 4 working games past the trial period it 's a good buy just know you 're not getting what 's advertised if you have a ||| 1

i ordered one from an amazon partner for plus shipping then with my discount the price was even lower so i got one for less than the shipping cost true the seller made a little on the shipping maybe 4.50 not counting time think how much apple must be making ! the packaging did n't mention nano so with a bit of trepidation i plugged it into the wall and my ipod and my nano liked it ! charging happened it must have been made before the nano came out as other reviewers have said buy this one and avoid a high price elsewhere ||| 1
i purchased the pouch the carring case shortly after i own more than one car and have four family menbers that are always on the case holds the gps mount and all the different foam insert holds the gps while still in the pouch or velcro staps hold the mount the ac way when you are looking for it everthing is in one case is made well and very plain looking on the outside so not to draw any attention ||| 1

i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway originally the specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion if you need a cable an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway there are a few very few devices that do use all 24 pins but with the advent of hdmi nobody really makes them anymore ||| 1
product came in as describe super clear picture quality as it 's supposed to be as monster cable brand ||| 1
i am not really a big tech person so i do n't have the mega system hooked up to my computer and but i do know that since i got this i have been blasting my music like crazy i do n't really mind too much that the power and volume is under the desk because i have enough space down there and all i have to is lean down anyway i personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud considering its computer speakers i do n't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when i 'm in the shower so i am pretty much happy with them ||| 1
these speakers are amazing i am truly shocked to receive something so sweet at an unbelievable price amazon thank you for the hook up my speaker system rocks my delivery experience with amazon was great ca n't thank you enough keep up the great service truly ||| 1
i needed new computer speakers after my cyber acoustics died after only 3 months so i was n't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast i use a mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers but could n't decide to go with either the sound sticks creatures or these well since i am saving up for a new laptop i wanted to save as much money as possible plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they still work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to max and sub base up to max yes i underestimated these speakers when i turned a song in in itunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair ! i was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk ! moral one do not underestimate speakers my good brands even with low wattage i highley suggest these speakers for people who do n't have much to spend or do n't want to spend alot of money if you want better quality i would go with sound sticks or creatures but these look like they will serve me well ||| 1
the camera is perfect if using the camera for keeping in touch with friends and family this is the camera for you the picture is clear not to grainy the only heads up is lighting try to use the camera in a well light area we are stationed in japan and use the camera almost daily to spend time with family back home the camera has added great joy to the family especially when feeling homesick the best part is the price wo n't break the bank ||| 1
around here canon ink is difficult to locate and expensive when you actually find someone who carries it it may take a week or two to arrive using amazon 's free shipping option but i get fantatstic results from my canon pixma that i also bought from amazon most of my printing is borderless 8 and the quality is always great definitely worth it if turnaround time is a problem buy two so you always have a spare ||| 1

a great solution to theft prevention for this gps the legs fold up to make a compact unit that easily fits into the glove box as for the grip on the dash it works very well there is a little bit of creep on slick dash boards but it sticks better than the garmin bean bag on my 2720 ||| 1
the reader is fast example i took images from my camera recently i plugged this reader into my plugged in the card the card mounted i dragged the images to my pictures folder and they copied immediately no waiting i was amazed because with my mia usb reader it could take a while to transfer that many images over a minute a copy dialog did n't even pop up because it transferred so fast it does n't hurt that it 's a cutie too 5 stars ||| 1

operation of the sony single disc dvd player has been straight forward picture quality is very good and the desired basic features have functioned without problems in other words in the 2 months since we have owned this player quality and reliability have been high price too was very reasonable that means durability is the last quality to consider which is why i have given the player a 4 rather than a 5. there is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years but we wo n't know that for years ||| 1
these mini work great in our sony mavica cd cameras at a cost of only cents apiece ||| 1
this is a great machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload print quality is excellent scanning quality is excellent copying quality is excellent faxing is faxing the control software is fine not great but it does the job the networking features including wireless makes this printer a snap to integrate into your office business using a wireless network some concerns after heavy usage the top document feeder used for scanning faxing or photocopying a stack of loose documents begins to jam the rollers need to be cleaned to avoid this and getting jammed paper out of the top document feeder is very difficult however the fact that this piece of equipment even has a document feeder for this sort of functionality is pretty good the fax log keeps a record of outgoing faxes and you can them easily enough but you ca n't faxes received the fax log merely logs their reception but not the fax itself overall it 's a good at a reasonable price with a lot of functionality built into it would recommend to anyone who only has a light document load with maybe the occasional large document scanning copying requirement ||| 1
as long as i own a pair of these headphones i will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again they sound perfect i can not fathom a more balanced natural sound these babies put you in the recording studio or in the concert hall ! bass is crisp taut and strong you can feel it yet it is not overbearing or boomy midrange is balanced so well that you 'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes the folding feature is handy the only things to be aware of are the following first you have to break them in they start sounding better after a few hours of use second they do n't have an inline volume control which i will dearly miss from my koss finally plenty of sound escapes so do n't crank them too much in the library or at grandma edith 's funeral other than that you have no excuse put your ipod 's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong and order these or if you do n't want to fork out 40 order the koss ktx pro titanium phones which are almost as good as these and definitely the best in the 20 price range ||| 1
good sound for the price and very durable discrete design i prefer the plug '' design to other headphones they do n't fall out and i can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane it makes almost no difference just be careful in the traffic SMILE the sound is good especially for music where the bass is most important but the treble is also good for pop and rock the middle range is a bit dry for classical music but still good enough for an i have two pairs ||| 1
these earphones are excellent quality noise that gets in from outside is so low that i can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me in addition the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones these earphones do in fact rest in your ear it can be slightly uncomfortable to put them in the first time but you quickly get used to it especially when sound is playing in addition the package includes three sets of differently sized earpieces including the default piece shown ||| 1
i just got my nano last week and the minute i turned it on before even transfering any music to it i could hear a faint from the nano it comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as i turn off the unit has anyone experienced this with theirs my first generation nano does not experience this noise i plan to take it to an apple store and try to get a replacement just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the 250 and the new toy already appears to be defective lesson learned for everyone else if you do n't have to get a new toy right when it comes out wait let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself ||| 1
i have never been a fan of the ipod i have been an iriver and owner i had a toshiba gigabeat and currently own an archos the reason for owning a nano is because of the size of the it is too big to pack around unless i am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on the nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote soon i am very happy with it it loads from itunes very easily and i have had no problems with it not playing certain files and i would reencode them if there was a problem apple do n't let me down ||| 1
the koss 's were not made for headphone users to begin with they reveal the low fidelity of files compared with lp 's or cd 's also they require a '' or other adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment these headphones have been around a long time check out the old photos of the watergate '' hearings from and notice that the senators attorneys were all listening through koss pro headphones their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction unfortunately their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome negatives 1 weight about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary headphones 2 tight headband as noted the fit is fatiguing if your 'hat size ' is greater than 7 3 the coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace it 's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount positives 1 audio fidelity unless you want to spend at least 300 for a set of headphones the sound quality and fidelity of the 's is almost impossible to beat 2 value as noted above for the price you pay these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced 3 durable my first pair lasted 30 years they were dropped and knocked around and finally gave out when it think a voltage spike surged in the left earphone fusing a coil 4 isolation the paddded earphones block out external sound very well the sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range these sound great at low and high volumes the biggest positive and the reason why i prefer to use 's for audio mixing other studio applications and serious listeining is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen size matters they are heavy and bulky so they 're not easily concealed and since ipod or players use the mini plugs these require additional hardware if you just want music ' then these will not work well if you want at a bargain price the 's are still the best choice around ||| 1
bought this mouse over 3 months ago and its still going strong the batteries last forever i 've never replaced them yet my only problem is that at times i will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom but it wo n't seem to turn off ! i reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again and this always does the trick other than that very ergonomic extremely smooth and precise i like the solid feel of a slightly weighty mouse and with the batteries this mouse feels just right if only it were n't for the mouse not turning off sometimes i 'd give it a 5 ||| 1
this is a great little product to take the place of the builtin finger pad on a laptop usb just plugs in and the mouse is the perfect size for comfortable us ||| 1
i previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse i can't recall the brand but it was awful battery contacts would n't stay in contact and it was hard to use i was using my laptop at my brother 's house and he lent me his logitech it was awesome ! just plug in and use ! i went home that nite and looked it up here and saw that others had had similar experiences so i bought one i 've had it for about a month now and love it the scroll wheel being able to lean left right for sideways scrolling is a nifty feature i recommend this product highly ||| 1
i have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well it lives up to its claims the face tracking '' feature is not always fast and accurate but generaly works in good light this camera does require a significant amount of light to give good results but then again what camera does n't image quality is about as good as you will get from this type of device ||| 1
my first purchase of the resulted in a return as the display was n't mounted properly within the plastic housing this resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about '' and made the viewing unpleasant the screen also was n't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100 having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it suffice to say quality control missed this one after getting a new replacement i unfortunately had a bad pixel after using the for a week now i noticed some red aliasing between characters the crispness of the display is fine but i changed display fonts to to make it look better the control buttons on the monitor are too small the speakers leave less than desired and useless the does not have dvi ports at mode its fine for doing basic computing like web surfing and office applications viewing dvd movies at full mode was difficult to watch at smaller sizes was fine all in all the is not a bad monitor for the price for general computing work ||| 1

after ordering inks from several different places on the web and having some problems with them i discovered that amazon sold oem at great prices i went to my local office supply store and purchased a complete set of 5 inks for my canon pixma at a cost of 75 later that day i found them on amazon at almost the price ! also when it comes to oem inks i discovered that they seem to last almost 3 times as long as the generic and refilled versions ||| 1

i have used gps units from cobra garmin and lowrance i consider this cobra unit to be one of the best i started with the cobra but it was stolen after a month then i bought the lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the cobra i returned the lowrance and bought the garmin 340. advantages of the cobra is that it has a large screen and a solid mount despite its size the interface is n't quite as intuitive as garmin but once you learn it it is actually better the traffic service is also nice costs more with the garmin the cobra is the most capable of the gps units i mentioned but overall i am happier with the garmin because of it 's smaller size and lower price ||| 1
the unit operates as good as any other gps system available plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches i am very impressed with the gps but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed the unit falls off the window and from the dash plus the power cord comes out too easily the unit deserves a five star rating but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided ||| 1
i would highly recommend reading the businessweek review on this product that came out on september 12 2005. businessweek as reviewed all the major gps navigation options on the market and ranks the cobra nav one 4500 as number one here is an excerpt from the businessweek article '' cobra 's nav one 4500 and garmin 's streetpilot 2720 which each sell for 800 to use a more straightforward approach the traffic info travels along with fm radio broadcasts from clear channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets an fm antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system '' i preferred the cobra mostly for its big bright screen and its radio receiver the garmin receiver is 200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio when you encounter traffic a on the screen and a voice give you three options keep driving reroute me or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one ||| 1
if money was no object i would prefer the totally wireless headset phone however this has been a great alternative i have tmj and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck while holding my toddler while preparing dinner compound my pain go figure ! i find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain but the product works great i have had no problems hearing anyone nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me the earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off even for someone with elfishly small ears like me ! ||| 1
i 've owned this headphone for about a year now and i 've got to say after going through multiple headphones this beats all others i 've tried if this one ever broke i doubt that 'll happen anytime soon i 'll surely buy another one again ! pros comfortable to wear the ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time even if you wear glasses you wo n't feel uncomfortable clear treble middle and bass you can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly even with completely flat eq setting the headset does very good job with sound provided you increase the volume up a bit more as with any headphones take time to 'break it in ' to have it function the best it can it means to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time about 24 or 32 hours sturdy wires this headphone seems to have been designed based on recording headphones in this regard the wire is very thick and long also it 's single wire format cons ear padding is perhaps too soft this means it wo n't fully cover your ear area and some of sound may leak out so note that when you listen to your music loud in public places although at first few weeks the ear padding is relatively hard if you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out look into getting canal type headphones instead as some others have pointed out tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at so be cautious of your movements you might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation but this affects all closed headphones so it 's not a huge negative point the headphone is quite big and on a small head you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head the size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head that 's all i 've got to say and overall this headset is definitely worth your money ||| 1
i think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where i can get an open computer i have at home with usb 1 and xp pro at work with usb 2. never had any type of compatibility issue this 128 mb size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion i plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon the amazing this is that i have just removed my usb drive from a clean pair of pants that went through the wash and dry cycle and this was the second time i ca n't believe it still works maybe i 'll have to start using that ridiculus cord and wear it around my neck through away your zip and floppy disks and get one of these things just make sure you back it up often ||| 1
i am very pleased with the quality of the product i have burned about a dozen discs and have had zero coasters after the rebate the price was very competitive ||| 1
hey do n't listen to those other schmucks so maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable but the rest just complain too much i love this thing ! i got it for christmas and now for 20 you ca n't beat that i use a standard charger for it in my car so i never have to worry about batteries it seems that the best way to get it to sound the best is work with your player or whatever your using equalizer i have also used it on my portable dvd player in the car and it sounds awesome ! for the price i highly recommend this product ||| 1
i 've used the for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all i would wish of course any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired setup but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever i wish the only drawback and it is minor is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when caps lock or num lock is on i have to look over at the wireless receiver for this additionally it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit yes it would draw down batteries more quickly but as an option it would be user selected all in all a good wireless combination and one i am quite glad i purchased life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming '' wow lord ! what a ride ! '' ||| 1
i read about these headphones in a magazine and i was intrigued by the reviews having a headphone fetish odd i know i decided to order them seeing that they were relatively this is a decision i am thoroughly glad i made these little headphones are absolutely incredible and they even outmatch in quality my larger headphones i have at home the bass is the best i 've ever heard in a headphone rich and deep and true the mids and heights are also brilliantly emulated the mere fact that it is portable with its own compact and innovative carrying case means that you can take the excellent sound with you wherever you go i definitely recommend these pones to anyone who values outstanding quality in their music and games stars ||| 1
after buying my ipod i felt my stereo system wasnt geting anyuse so i felt that instead of buying the bose soundock which is about 300 your better off only spending about 25 and getting just as good quality ||| 1
i was unsure at first if this product would work with my ipod nano but after checking out griffin 's website i decided to go ahead and order it it works great ! i like to play solitaire and read text files on my nano so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if i did n't use the screen so much tunejuice means i do n't ever have to worry about that again i just keep a couple of batteries with me and i can keep listening playing reading or whatever on my nano as long as i want love it i posted the above review on may 22 2006 after having had the tunejuice for almost 3 weeks two of those weeks were spent on vacation and this little gadget got a of use now about 5 months after first receiving the tunejuice i 'm about to order my second one to replace the first one i still love it and did get a of use out of it but snapping batteries on and off so many times caused the wires leading from inside the battery compartment to the 'snaps ' that connect to the battery itself to break off despite that i feel like i got my money 's worth and i 'm buying another one ||| 1
i have been using my sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures i have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently mtp music files because they use less file space the file size on pictures to use less memory the speck toughskin case to protect display window extra the ac sandisk usb charger instead of the computer usb port extra i do not use the raio or the video settings because of no interest and the large amount of memory the video consummes this player does fine using the earphones or hooked up to a audio center i think that the card will be on my list of upgrades the only upgrade i am made was to buy a better set of earphones i did not like the pair supplied with the unit my earphones have a volume control on the output cord which makes it much easier to control i am not sorry about buying this item from amazon ||| 1
pros easy to use last for days without charging depending on the use of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging and it lasted the trip enough memory space has radio works as a recorder small cons stopped working froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago when it 's on tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list if i hit play on such song the player just skips and plays the next song on the list but overall i 'm happy with my i 'd recommend it ||| 1
i did n't want to spend the money on this either but it is better i really do n't know why but it is no question about it perfect picture and sound ! i have a yamaha receiver which has hdmi hookups i tried a hdmi cable that came with my directv box from my toshiba hd dvd player and it was seriously lacking this hookup is much better ! i have a monster cable hdmi hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my sony 46 '' flat panel as well more but i 'm finally satisfied i 'm watching and listening to batman begins '' in true hd sound on hd dvd and it is superb ! ! ! ! this is just awesome ! the stuff of fantasy you only have to buy cables once so why not buy the best ! i highly recommend this move ||| 1
this remote will do everything you need or want simple to use and great customer service i had a couple of glitches '' buttons that did n't work quite right when i first programmed the device but the harmony support team helped me through those areas the changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the harmony web site so if i ever need to all i have to do is reload the info like another reviewer i also have a tivo 2 actually and the only button that would n't work on my harmony 680 was the clear '' button customer service fixed that in a jiffy too i have owned several multiple device remotes over the years and never had one so good that i could really put away all my other remotes i now only use one the harmony 680. fantastic device ! i 'd give it 6 stars if i could ||| 1
i paid about a dollar for this holder holds and protects the ipaq nicely can hold some credit cards as well as id overall a decent product for a low price ||| 1
this is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop it 's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case it protects my laptop from surges through the ac outlet and phone jacks i have been pleased with apc products for about six years they provide excellent customer support i highly recommend their products ||| 1
it also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time i 've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle out of two that come with it still looks almost full if the price was a little more consumer friendly i 'd give it five stars i mean come on when you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name of 's for less than 14 the profit margin on something like this is probably 200 or more ||| 1
i found this keyboard to be very helpful i am a graduate student and spend a lot of my time typing papers while my laptop can be used to type when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable this keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing the bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if i would like without stopping the connection i would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it overall a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier ||| 1
i had it now for 12 months and no problems with it its tiny lightweight and great speed my old computer has to work quite hard to recognize it but my laptop has no problems one minor you can not hook too many other stuff on the usb at the same time i just ordered another one ||| 1

excellent sound much much much better that the one that comes with any players zens or ipod for those that have ever used safety earplugs in the industry they feel like them and really isolate the noises after that the sound is excellent compare to many others and amazon offers a very good price here also good to have 3 sizes 2 pairs of each airplane adapter case cleaner very good product ||| 1

i am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone it looks good but more importantly it feels good button placement weight smoothness everything was done well coming from wired mice the lack of a wire is very freeing i am also especially happy with how small the usb radio receiver is i am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is what 's strange is i bought the s 530 desktop set for mac at the same time the mouse in that set looks nearly identical except for color however it has a different weight and simply does n't feel quite as comfortable to use it only fits the hand the same but once you move it it lacks the same comfort and ease of use as this mouse ||| 1
received this speaker as a replacement for the advent which did not work at all this one was much easier to install and calibrate ! very happy with range and sound quality highly recommended ||| 1
these are very comfortable to wear and the sound is great i use them out jogging and they stay put without any pressure on the ear the tight fit blocks out any outside noise so be careful around traffic as you can not hear cars i would highly recommend these to anyone ||| 1
i bought these ear headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club the sound quality is acceptable not exceptional the construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right that places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out i have no idea why sony thought that this was a good design for the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord i would give these a great ||| 1
the logitech cordless trackman wheel was purchased in 2006. i have had this for two months at the time this review is being written i bought this to replace the corded version of the same item the cordless works as well as the corded one the trackball does n't has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did but the difference is minimal i wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use i find the shape of the logitech trackman to fit the hand very naturally it is also much less strenuous on the wrist than a normal mouse which is why i use it i replaced the corded one so that we could easily move the mouse to different locations for use this is for home use with multiple users with different mouse location preferences i took the corded one to use at work where it still performs flawlessly hours a day i also have a logitech cordless keyboard there are two places where both these items could be improved each one of these items needs it own receiver it would save some of my limited home desk space if these could be combined into one unit i initially had the receivers out of sight behing an lcd monitor i found that it was necessary to move them away from the monitor to get them to work reliably this is a documented requirement in the owners manual but that necessity takes away from the convenience of the wireless the receivers as stated earlier take up space i would rather not spare ||| 1
we have a trackman corded model and loved it so i got this one for my work computer it works just as well as the corded one when i 'm in my office for travel the part you plug in is a little bulky so i usually leave it at home when i travel it 's not a small usb stick that goes in the back it 's a long corded mouse looking device that the signal to the trackman i do n't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a usb stick instead of the other for travel all that said i love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me ||| 1
my canon 510 got glowing reviews just about across the board but not this printer i have very little space and needed something small just for photos so even though there were many negative reviews i went ahead and bought it could n't be happier ! colour fabulous ! and when you print on stock paper you can use photo to do some extra artwork on i love it ||| 1

if you buy this service plan print out the contract and keep your receipt i did not purchase the plan but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it some notes on the contract 1. it is only good in the united states including washington dc but minus maine but it does not include guam virgin islands etc so if you are in another country or outside the 50 states this contract will be nothing but a waste of money 2. this contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple 3. they will only if the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item that is if the manu warranty is still good you have to use it 4. if the item needs to be shipped will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period if the item is being replaced you will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered product to our authorized service center reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to you '' i 'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you 5. no lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the same defect and a upon the time of a repair as determined by them they will replace it with a product of comparable performance repairs performed while the product is under manufacturer 's warranty do not apply '' does n't sound like a great no lemon policy your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year 6. there are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans such as they do n't cover accidents and they do n't cover the elements or acts of god '' sorry i had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things but in all seriousness read the list before you purchase so now that i have summarized much of the contract if you want to get the service warranty please read the contract since i did n't cover everything ! ! ! do n't hold me liable since i do n't have much money anyways also i think this is typical in warranty contracts but you will occassionally see the phrase at our discretion '' in the contract assuming they are n't jerks with their discretion and are n't too tough to deal with i would give the warranty 4 stars minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy i did n't get the coverage because the product i was going to get it for had just made into the next price category so it was pricy for my product being at the lower price end of the scale ||| 1
easy enough to pop off the normal ant roadmate 700 and pop on this magmount version and what a difference it made ! signals really are remarkedly improved suggested for folks in hilly areas to nearly guarentee you 'll get the birds ||| 1
a lot cheaper than docking stations and 'does what it says on the tin ' quite stylish too as docking stations go ||| 1
we used the to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling the power gave us ample range does it reach 18 or 20 miles do n't know but 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the rocky mountains it 's a great way to stay in touch when traveling the batteries are rechargeable both the ear pieces were very good for privacy very easy to use and well worth the price a good investment ||| 1
i was hesitant to get this since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception now that i bought it i 'm very glad i have it it does all the things you might want in a disaster inluding a flashlight red flashing light especially if your car breaks down at night a siren if you 're trapped in a building ac battery and crank power and multiple radio bands while some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations in a disaster you only need a few stations as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news between the am fm tv and noaa bands my radio will received a huge number of stations many more than would ever be needed in a disaster i did n't try the cellphone charging function it comes in a carrying case only minor criticisms the case seems like an afterthought it does n't hold the ac adapter the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit not that protective however it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything overall this is all you should need for light siren and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster ||| 1
i just recieved my hdmi cable and am very impressed the price is just what it should be about 5 and makes me wonder how somebody would spend over 100 for this cable at a store the service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days ! i highly recommend this cable i just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the tv and wow what a great picture all around the color is just so much more vivid using hdmi compared to component 3 wire connectors get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others ||| 1

okay so it was about at night i was coming on to a mile long bridge that goes over a lake where i live i was doing the speed limit is 40. as i start to approach the bridge i start getting a small warning i instantly slow down to the speed limit as i start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so i slow down even more to 35 mph then it gets to full i look to my left where there is a service parking area and in the pitch dark i see the reflectors of the one and only crown vic police car as i pass the police car i start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead if i did n't have this detector he would have gotten me doing 20 over the limit thank you escort ! ||| 1
this is my second escort passport 8500 the first one is in another car it saved me many times for getting caught though i 'm not maniac driver the detection range is very good it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car i love the blue color and it only costs 30 more than red the only problem that i have experienced on my first one is sometimes i got laser false warning signals especially on raining day with defog is on i heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes pop and laser false warning signals and my first is in my turbo charged car i 'm not sure if pop alerts were false but since it wo n't help much i have it turned off overall it 's very good detector you will get payback if you own one ||| 1

i got mine to work in about 30 min following s huffs directions below followed exactly there was only one thing not mentioned that i had to do to get it to work once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable wep and put in the key and passphrase i had to turn wep back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 this is what worked for me at any rate i 've had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised i gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain from s huff the tips that anthony taylor left helped me get it working but i still had some issues i 've added onto his tips from his review below wep on your router or ap the button for 30 seconds if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue and unplug while still holding button plug back in after secs your internet explorer browser and type default ip of expander a window will pop up leave the user name blank and put admin as a password this is default password sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your router or ap change password on the expander if desired save settings all settings should be correct due to auto configuration wep on the expander once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or ap in step 6 aka same passphrase save settings again 5.5 as soon as you enable wep on your expander you will loose your connection to it as it 's now setup for wep and your router is n't keep this in mind drove me nuts to your router or ap settings and enable wep 7 unplug your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in bang you 're done enjoy ||| 1

i have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them i had purchased this one to replace my uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer this one does n't i also like the feature of the intercom feature my daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she is n't on the phone i can contact her to talk to her my daughter also likes the mute feature where she can put somebody on hold if she is on the phone to ask me a question so that person on the other end does n't hear her the phone has many other features but those are 2 usefule ones i like along with the caller id ||| 1
i am extremely pleased with the purchase i am using it in my office simple plug and play no brainer ! ! if i get the mir the cost comes to 5 none can better that transaction with amazon was flawless as usual ||| 1
like most other reviews i will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings what helped me is when i looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit movies are amazing ! my music collection never sounded so good if you want to get away from it all for awhile slip these babies in your ears and chill ||| 1

i needed a simple solution for my office i wanted to be able to use the phone but not get tied down by the handset or the headset here was my solution since the has the port for a headset i purchased a jabra bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office so far wow ! ! ! its worked out great the phone is also good by itself plus it was inexpensive through amazon for anyone interested in going the route i took you will not be disappointed oh yes you are limited to about 25 ft or in my case as i work in a hospital where there are alot of other signals and lead lined walls with max length at about 20 before you begin to hear static the phone was a great buy as was the jabra adapter ||| 1
i have had this tv since 2006. i absolutley love it ! ! i did extensive research before i bought a large screen tv and found that this samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck i read some reviews saying that dlp technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action one reviewer specifically said to try playing bourne supremecy '' to see an example of the rainbow effect this was the first dvd i played on this tv and i did not once have a problem with rainbow effect overall i have no complaints with this tv samsung has produced an excellent product i recommend either satellite or hd programming for the best picture regular cable comes in sort of grainy as far as where to buy it i recommend best buy i originally was going to buy from amazon because when i first looked they were offering free shipping when i decided to buy their was no longer free shipping so off to best buy i went where they price matched me with amazon 's price no questions asked best buy offers an extended warranty for around 400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems it will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it overall a wonderful product ||| 1
there is a little story before this i bought a pair of sony 's they are full cup headphones because i lost the earbuds which came with my player sony i took them out of the package and found that even at full volume on the player it can not drive the headphones sufficently i went to a few electronics stores then found the koss on with the review yes there is a slight hiss but i find it alright the biggest gripe i have is that whenever someone within about ft ie on a bus or subway uses a cellphone this devices picks it up you can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers i do most of my listening at home so this wo n't bo too much of an issue it also does a great job of amplifying the signal it works very well i can now listen to my 's properly and they are very good ! i have n't used the eq much but what i can say is that it is very very sensitive raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference at a half my headphones start to distort if your looking for a nice little eq preamp this is the product for you it has its drawbacks though mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course the hiss but it is n't too loud i can live with it i reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer ||| 1
this does what it 's advertized too i like not having wires the ipod in my bag and just the headset it would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset ie turn off the headset receiver and ipod all from the headset instead i have to get the ipod back out turn it off turn the receiver off then turn the headset off otherwise the sound is good and the headset has n't broken for me yet ||| 1
i picked up 4 pairs of these on amazon and have applied the ca and nylon tape fix to the first pair took about 10 minutes to do let it cure overnight headphones look ok with just the right amount of geekhood proudly announced afterwards reminiscent of the last generation of geeks with the tape on the glasses sound is very good better than most earbuds they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated logitech transiever and range is outstanding my only beef is how long i have to hold down the power switch to turn them on and so far i have not successfully established a connections with my treo 650 1 star held back because of need of customer applied eco and they are only partially functional with the nano ca n't use the advance track feature of the headphones ||| 1
i am ordering my third of this capacity and have one in the 200 capacity range from case logic this is a great product and is manufactured well holds the discs well and is easy to take them in and out i do n't transport them so i ca n't comment on that like others have said it is not easy if you want to move pages around but you can do it and it does make it nice for organizing as you fill it up get this if you need a lot of storage ||| 1
this headphone extension is perfect ! it is not as long as described about 15 feet but that 's with me the connections are tight the plugs do n't pull apart it maintains sonic quality it also retains it 's elasticity using this extension cord my grado 's sound better than any wireless phones you wo n't be dissapointed ! ||| 1
this is a pretty decent cheapo case if you want something that you 'll use every day in the car or at your dj gigs then you may want to get something a little sturdier for my archival purposes however it works just fine ||| 1
for at amazon this was a great purchase since it would have cost over at a retail store including tax and shipping eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the amazon estimate unloaded the tv right to the tv stand and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture sound worked i signed for it and eagle asked if i wanted the packaging carted away very pleased with the service part so far my 61 '' hdtv sony av and 5.1 surround this is not a digital unit was n't sure it would work but there are three options to a home theater 1 basic connection 2 optical 3 hdmi sony dvd motorola box we use comcast sony vcr experience as far as the tv the hd channels look sharp and clear however the non hd channels are n't as sharp as my 36 '' sony crt tv there are several settings on the samsung for and wide format setting to or wide for non hd channels improves the picture quality a little but it does n't effect the enjoyment since i purchased this for the hd and it blows me away the tv controls are simple to use and the on screen menu 's are easy to navigate the sound out of the tv is not adequate for surround sound but i hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes hd come to life i like the fact that you can connect components to an av the tv so there is room for 3 additional components with my i also hooked up my laptop there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the tv after changing the video settings on the laptop the mannual does a nice job for xp users it was incredible ! the camcorder hooks up to the side of the tv so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall it was a simple and again the picture quality just blew me away ! ! ! i highly recommend this tv to anyome looking for a 50 '' plus tv ||| 1
the ink toner i received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion ||| 1
a very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer the reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently ||| 1
this was by far the easiest computer peripheral i have ever setup ! works flawlessly with my netgear wireless router ||| 1
it is remarkable that even though there are hundreds of ipod cases in existence none of them are i tried four different cases both hard plastic and silicone variants and the iskin case comes the closest protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use the case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone the ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen in addition there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case and this provides the screen protection due to the in the silicone the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod so you do n't have to worry about it scratching the case even has a flap that covers the dock connector preventing dust from entering yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case the most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling actually i think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel the only real downside i found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it i would not trust it at all so i took it off it would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well but as i said above i have yet to find a perfect ipod case like most silicone cases this one does also attract lint in your pockets but it is not as bad as other cases unfortunately even though this is a great case it is not readily available i could n't find it in any store and amazon only sells it through marketplace sellers i ordered from applelinks and they delivered it to me in four days whatever you do do n't order from the iskin company directly i have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases they should themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them ||| 1
ordered the ink cartridge and had it within 4 days love the service at amazon ||| 1

i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon with color changes after 3 conversations with canon customer care we decided it was not the printer but the cheaper ink i switched back to canon bit the bullet on the price and everything is fine i found decent prices on amazon particularly at eek industries ||| 1

i was so happy with my creative zen nano that i bought one as a gift i love the color choice and the sound is great love the pause button it came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band you do not need to buy one ! ! amazon delivered it in 2 days ||| 1
this printer was purchased for my wife 's birthday and arrived in two to three days considering money spent the printer works quite well pictures come out very good overall an hp 95 or hp 97 cartridge is used for color photos it contains three color inks but no black still photos will easily satisfy the average owner an hp 100 cartridge can be used for black and white photos yes the color cartridge must be exchanged for the black one when converting from color to black and white and vise versa even so we find the printer fun and very simple to use just keep in mind that the price of ink will soon exceed the price of the printer if used often what we do is use it for special occasions or when the grandchildren come over gary ||| 1
this is perfect for use in kitchen space and has incredible pictue quality ||| 1
i 'm using monster optical cable as well but with different reasons behind anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from magnetic field or emf ||| 1
sound quality is very good and i have n't run out of battery so far the base is somewhat smaller than what i expected from the pictures the handsets are well designed on my previous phone it happened that the mute '' function became engaged when i kept the phone between my head and my shoulders this did not happen with these so far speakerphone on the base is a nice feature and makes the phone usable even during power outages answering machine works well easy to copy phonebook entries between phones ||| 1
this does exactly what it is supposed to do it is light easy to pack easy to use and probably difficult to crack though pc pilferers have n't tried taking a hacksaw to my cable lock so i can not comment as to its ability to withstand saws or any other criminal 's tool other reviewers baffled me as mine is as described by amazon there is neither an alarm nor batteries why bother with an alarm if the pc is locked with steel cable seems like overkill ||| 1
i tried both microsoft 's lifecam and had 'em both home and ran trials with my intel pentium d dual core cpu with 2 gigs of ram and with both of those the video lagged the audio distractingly so spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly microsoft customer service rep one evening got through on their toll free line and he pointed me to new software for the downloaded the 50 meg plus file installed it but the still produced video audio when i created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on media player or editing in windows movie maker so i talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my i believe excellent computer all recommended logitech when buying webcams i then marched back to best buy and traded my 99 microsoft for a logitech quickcam orbit mp for bb 's price of 139.95 you can find this logitech unit cheaper all over the place including of course here at amazon the package i bought included an inexpensive headset which i have n't used so far although i have n't tried the orbit in a video phone call yet from the moment i turned it on i had that satisfing good feeling that i bought a winner installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps got a usb composite device has not passed windows logo testing '' screen a couple of received the same screen on get this the microsoft cams ! i just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far the audio sync with video in making a recording is right on remember that was primary reason for taking back the microsoft cameras and the picture clarity on my lcd flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture excellent detail and smoothness of video besides the superior audio sync with video the orbit mp is remarkably better than the and way above the 49 microsoft in all other criteria too in my opinion after comparison testing the orbit 's special effects are interesting and fun the pan tilt excellent the face tracking is vigorous and alive fun to watch the little orbit camera turn but i have n't tested in actual live conferencing yet all in all for webcams i 'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me head for logitech they 've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance the orbit mp is a keeper ! not going to waste anymore time searching and testing and my advice to microsoft you 'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those lifecams i 've relied on the microsoft name on peripherals keyboards and i 've generally been very satisfied but in webcams with me the microsoft brand now takes a back seat to logitech ||| 1
easy to operate and good focus just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam ||| 1
garmin ique i 'm very pleased with my little ique while it 's not perfect it 's pretty darn amazing i had actually purchased a lowrence iway 350 gps but then my husband discovered the ique on sale at costco for about more with the ique offering so many more features i returned the lowrence and purchased the ique with my husband and i both having the same machines we can beam information to each other or send them over bluetooth it has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device as it is n't very intuitive and the manuals especially for the pda are limited my husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the gps and he 's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas it 's very sophisticated and the maps are great better detail than the lowrence we purchased a 2 gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it and there were still 300 gigs to spare i had no trouble downloading the maps or the active sync software the basic gps functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it the voice directions are clear and concise and it quickly if you go off course you can plan your route in advance without having the gps activated this is a good idea since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites and you can be on your way if you 've viewed your route before starting out i used the gps on a trip stratford canada and it was wonderful having the canadian maps as well as the us maps available i even used it handheld while walking to my from the theater every once in awhile there is a glitch it said the theater was on the left which would have taken me into the avon river ! but it 's generally right on target and i find most of the problems are operator error such as turning too soon the route to home '' feature is very convenient granted the ique does n't always take you on the shortest route but it will get you where you 're going and if you 're directionally challenged '' like i am it becomes indispensible the car mounting bracket works fine it 's popped off occasionally in hot weather but generally stays put the bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle the gps would work in a if you needed to use it in a rental car i 've spent more time learning the pda portion which uses windows mobile 2003 edition the ique uses outlook as its interface so you 'll have to have it installed on your computer not having used outlook before i installed outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it which was helpful the pda has so many functions that it 's hard to even describe what this little machine can do it will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts checks accesses the internet if you get a card recognizes handwriting has a voice recorder interfaces with other bluetooth units sends alarms has word and excel even has a couple of good games i got a separate sd card for music and downloaded a lot of songs and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable it has bass boost it uses windows media player so you can organize all of your playlists you can download any programs that are available for windows mobile 2003 including tv shows and videos i never thought i 'd find much use for a pda but i 'm using it every day no more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar address book or even an ipod everything is in one little machine and even though it is n't that intuitive once you 've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs we 've called garmin tech support a few times and although they are only open during regular business hours we found american staff who are very knowledgeable about the product since a good gps will run at least this was a great bargain at around we 've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it wo n't wear out too quickly as i 've heard palm pilots tend to do i 'm really enjoying the ique ||| 1
we bought this about a month ago from amazon the product itself seems fine we used it on a vacation drive from nj to myrtle beach and back at times it was a help like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in va and we needed an alternate route however you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it does n't always recommend the best or shortest route also it was missing certain stores restaurants etc that had been around for awhile we liked that it is a pda though my husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it this way when he has to wait around he will have something to do cons you should be to get one of these set up match sure you get patches as unit will lock up manufacturer has discontinued this model they still offer some support but be warned that this is a discontinued model since it became discontinued it dropped in price about 60 two weeks after i bought it which annoys me somewhat will be spending extra to get bigger memory card came with expired outlook coupon why bother including this pros nice display and controls came with mount and dock some do n't you have to buy extra we had no trouble with the suction cup mount had to pry it off the window with a knife one time but agree that most placement seems to block driver view through windshield also a pd ||| 1
this phone was an additional phone for the model phone system used for vonage this system has every feature that i could want including range and quality there are no negatives i am highly recommending this phone and system ||| 1
not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture you would n't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing i have shown it to an owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the the unit is not perfect it does freeze occasionally but the function has always unlocked it the video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also but the conversion software was able to handle very large files i suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions sound quality is great combine this with sennheiser earbuds and you 'll love it this is my forth type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product the previous player creative zen nano plus 1 gb quit working the week the warranty ran out thumbs up on this one ||| 1
i purchased this cable solely to connect my gpsmap to my hp laptop so far it has performed perfectly i have not tried to use it for other applications yet so i ca n't comment on how well it would work in other situations ||| 1
i find this printer to be better than hp or epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles just a solid printer that performs as i anticipated ||| 1
the zen micro is brilliant i have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i 've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice i 've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect i had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better it is very easy to transfer files to it i always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software i use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me overall the zen micro is a very good product ||| 1
i bought four of these so far they appear to work well they do not work with compact flourescent lights well but are fine with incandescent bulbs ||| 1
i bought this screen as a replacement for my 17 '' hyundai which is a great screen for gaming which was the replacement for a dell that i gave to my wife anyways this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times more than enough for my flight sims movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution has n't been a problem the design is probably the neatest looking out there subjective i realize the only gripe i have this monitor is lack of swivel sigh other than that i 'm very pleased with everything about this screen ||| 1
wow just got one of these at a great price hooked it up to my mac via a dvid cable and it boots up at native resolution 1680 x 1050 automatically no muss no fuss text is crisp and clean ||| 1
my favorite thing about this phone is that the caller id captures 11 digit numbers which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call my old phone only captured 10 digits which meant i had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first this new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number i put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in very handy as far as being a phone it does everything well and after a couple of months i am still as happy as could be with it ||| 1
this is the rockinest think i 've ever seen or buyed dudes ! ! ! check it ou ||| 1
this is my first gps and i wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking hiking kayaking and in the car to i found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls also the 2 times i called garmin with questions i was able to talk to someone who is in the usa as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some on the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software ||| 1
here 's the deal i 've been an avid magellan user for the past 3 years i love my magellan i 've never liked the garmins because of their clumsy interface the buttons placed above the display never made sense to me and how the menu structure was built however we 're planning a 2000 mile road trip from utah up to the oregon coast we needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time my wife bought me the magellan explorist 600 for fathers day i forced myself to use it for two days and believe me it was torture i could go on and on about why i sent it back what i ordered as a replacement was the gpsmap now keep in mind that i felt like someone who had turned to the dark side i could n't be happier with my decision while i agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps and the expense of additional ones this unit rocks ! it acquires satellites within seconds it has expandable memory it has a color screen it manages geocaches it it stores 1000 waypoints it has sirf technology it is a usb interface it has a belt clip it changes display contrast at night automatically it slices it dices suddenly the dark side is n't so dark ! ! this is a great unit that i would recommend to anyone ||| 1
i had been talking about wanting an player but i did not want an ipod as i heard you can not add files in windows format and that 's what all of my music is i received this 4 gb player for my birthday in june 2006 and this is the first player i have ever owned although there are a few little quirks overall i am not disappointed and would recommend this player like many rechargeable items it required a lengthy initial charge before first use after that the future charges do n't seem to take as long the player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge although i 've never run it completely down i have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues i installed the software on my computer and the disk is where you will find the owner 's manual i was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner 's manual and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my player froze and i had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it it came with 20 songs only one of which i had ever heard of and it was one of those bands that played once on saturday night live although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices i decided to leave them on there until i need the space about three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months i currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more as far as performance goes it performs pretty well the buttons are a little difficult to get used to as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel not too bad but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that 's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there you will be scrolling a lot i do not use all the functions that came with this player it has music fm radio photo voice video and a settings option i have used the music function and the voice recorder option both with good results the only downside to the voice recorder is that you ca n't get the recordings you made off the player and onto your computer it would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer as for syncing music files i have not had any problems although i did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded but when you try to play it it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list i do n't know what caused this also you can only store a song as one genre which is a little annoying be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the player you can not change the genre it came with a headset but i have never used it instead i purchased some panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it i do wish the player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer 's usb drive to charge another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen i ca n't remember it being dropped or anything so i do n't know what caused this but it 's pretty noticeable it does n't seem to affect the operation just the aesthetics overall the cons are little irritations to me and i would recommend this player to someone who does n't want an ipod ||| 1
pros easy to use last for days without charging depending on the use of course but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging and it lasted the trip enough memory space has radio works as a recorder small cons stopped working froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago when it 's on tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list if i hit play on such song the player just skips and plays the next song on the list but overall i 'm happy with my i 'd recommend it ||| 1
i 've never written a review but i 've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other amazon buyers so i felt a really good product like the anycom bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review i know experience and taste vary by individual but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint pros bluetooth connects immediately provides smooth accurate tracking size very portable some may find it too narrow i have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse battery life i get at least 2 days out of it before charing and i 'm a fairly heavy user usb charge attachment allows you to continue to work while recharging product nicely engineered good quality not tinny it 's built to take abuse cons have n't really found any it took me awhile to figure out how to connect until i read the manual line by line i do n't tend to do that then i realized it was pretty straight forward if you 're looking for a quality bluetooth traveling mouse this is the one ||| 1
i was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer the photo output is awesome and it 's very fast ! there are only two things i would comment on that new users might not be aware of i was ready to return the printer as i thought it was defective until i found out what the problems were 1 when the cartridges dry out it will tell you that the cartridges are incompatible this was confusing as i did have the correct cartridges in the printer a replace cartridge '' message would have been less ambiguous 2 the printer has so far appeared dead '' once when i went to turn it on it would not do so the solution is on hp 's website you must remove the rear door and do a hard reset i did this and the printer worked fine again the printer does not come with a usb cable but those can be easily bought for ||| 1
i 'm a skeptic no i mean i 'm really a skeptic especially in today 's marketplace because nothing is built like it used to be i do n't buy anything without checking it out first and even then i expect that it 's probably going to fail me when i do yeah wonderful view there huh well needless to say i was pleasantly and quite happily surprised when this device did n't fail me out of the box i 've been using my speedpad for almost a year now and i have to say that it has been by far more solid responsive and intuitive than i ever expected it to be i will not play a pc game without it plugged in now that 's how well this gamepad has worked for me here are the ins and outs 1 solid construction as others have stated this device feels very solid and is just generally sturdy as hell '' this alone surprised me not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days not too many at all ! so i 'm glad to see that this one was belkin did an excellent job in this department 2 software do yourself a favor when you get this device home do n't bother putting in the cd that comes with it instead go directly to belkin 's website download the newer version of the software which is near exactly the same as what 's on the cd but updated and install that plugging in your speedpad for the first time do that and you 'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all i 've had no problems with the software for this hardware and that 's generally the part i have trouble with the most the applications profiler and button editor function perfectly and macros are a snap to program kudos to belkin 's programmers on writing the software suite for this they did a good job 4 sticky keys most people have experienced myself included being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product basically what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box though just excercising '' the device pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over for a few seconds after plugging it in each time i went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad and i 've never had it happen since 5 other buttons the mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance and i do n't use it much at all because it 's hard to scroll up and down with it belkin may just have made that particular button a little solid the orange button above the also is n't that easy to press though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage it 's not impossible to press this button in fact i use it as my default map '' button in most of the games i play it 's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button i have n't experienced any problems hitting the 'space ' button below the that others have experienced my thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard my only complaint with it is that i ca n't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key i have to actually lift my thumb off the to do it and that 's not much of a complaint at all really the itself is a godsend ! i 'm a true console gamer having used nothing but for movement since all the time spent playing my old nes as a kid and using a joystick before that with my even older atari is all i know really in fact the one thing that 's kept me away from pc gaming all these years is i 've never ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or wasd for movement and probably never will get accustomed to that either for the longest time i was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming to keep up with other pc players while giving me an actual for movement and that is exactly what this gamepad did for me as i said at the top of this review i will never play a pc game without my nostromo speedpad plugged in this gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads have n't and that i really needed a controller interface that 's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that i forget i 'm using it most of the time allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game i 'm playing which is really the point of gaming in the first place is n't it the nostromo speedpad gets 5 stars from me i would recommend it to anyone who 's looking for the type of benefits i 've listed and for that matter i 'm recommending it right now in fact ||| 1
the sound of these earbuds are they are a value for the price however the in the ear '' design causes them to catch sweat and they wo n't last when you sweat into them alot after months of wearing them in the gym they will stop working i have gone through 3 pairs in the last 2 years ||| 1

the antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the gps units internal antenna this easily solved the issue of poor reception when the gps is inside of a car however the best accuracy i am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna the 9 feet using the gps 's internal antenna when in an open area garmin 's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around on my gps i feel the antenna was worth purchasing ||| 1
i use the suctions mount antenna because i remove from sight whenever i leave my car which is idea for my purposes the antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock the only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up ||| 1
this unit has in my thought was that one could play video games on it or view images from a camera however all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen so it does not allow me to do all i wanted it is also a bit on the loud side if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit i got one of those also and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor it also does not make much noise ||| 1

since there are very few cases that fit ipaq pdas i recommend you get this one depending on type of your ipaq 1900 series vs 3000 series you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your pda into the case once you 're done however it 's very easy to use and carry it comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use the case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket unlike so many other cases the obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface this case wo n't provide much in a way of side protection klutzes be warned the leather feels surprisingly good almost a lambskin kind of quality the credit card space is not very useful but you can shove a couple of business cards in there a solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available ||| 1
this is the perfect product for someone who travels with portable computers you do n't have to tote around long phone cords it retracts with no jamming ! excellent travel accessory ||| 1

if you 're looking for isolation from ambient noise these are great i use them as in ear monitors for my onstage use rock band and if i use the foam inserts i can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off i 've read some people complain that the bass response is not quite what they expected but frankly it does n't bother me a bit the only thing that 's awkward is removing them when they 're fully inserted for a while they 're rather small and getting hold of them can be a bit tricky i 'm using small bits of tape for pull tabs '' and it seems to work pretty well overall i 'm impressed with this product since it 's affordable and does exactly what it 's advertised to do ||| 1
i found this on clearance at another retailer i guess not everyone likes pink and it 's fabulous i thought it might be just for people but not so ! i 've got plenty of room it fits great and it does n't move still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way though makes mowing the lawn way more fun ||| 1
the phone works great ! i have three of these and a base the best phones i have had the other phones i have are the model previous version equally good i had trouble deregistering one of the phones as it has to be close to the original base kept telling me out of range i found out that pressing end and also deregisters ||| 1
i just use the keyboard like a business user i do n't use the media stuff i really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works i like that it 's not huge and does n't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that i never use the rechargeable mouse is handy as well prior to this i had two microsoft wireless combos in a row and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me i do n't know if it 's because it 's logitech or it 's bluetooth but the are as responsive as were they wired after they wake up '' ||| 1

this backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my macbook safe its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything i need as a chronically disorganized person the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings the strap is nicely padded and it 's elastic so shocks are well absorbed a nice touch is a zippered 'cavity ' at the top which is an ideal place to store a laptop charger the build quality seems excellent so far it looks to be a very durable product i 've always had good luck with wenger products in the past the best part about this backpack is that it does n't scream 'there 's a computer in here ! ' ||| 1
great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school it has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it one of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes ||| 1
great sound quality great signal quality i can hear everyone well and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well the main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger with a couple walls in between and i have no problems with signal the handsets are smaller than i expected but that 's actually a bonus since i had n't bought a new phone in a while and thought my old handset was too big and clunky the handsets are about 6 inches long not including the antenna part 1 and inches at the widest point by the display and 1 and inches thick at the thickest point does n't interfere with my wireless internet or any of my other electronics i 've used the phone while sitting next to my laptop while both i and the chargers were next to tv and stereos and with my cell phone going at the same time no interference the speakerphone part is n't that great the person on the other end can hear other sounds in the room plus they say it sounds like i 'm speaking from a great distance away but i 've never had a phone with a good speakerphone so was n't expecting that to work anyway would have been great if they 'd included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks i love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet solved my lack of working jacks problem ! ! the display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys the keys are not backlit the menus are fairly intuitive if you 've ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily it 's very easy to send phone numbers that you 've programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset when i first hooked everything up the phones got no dial tone but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall for some reason the cord they provided did n't work so when i swapped it out with the cord i had all the phones worked fine i 'd buy these again and recommend to others to buy ||| 1
this is definitely a comfortable mouse if you do n't have big hands it is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely even if you are the extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who do n't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward backward and switch between programs the button in the middle though the one that lets you switch programs is out of the way it takes just a bit more effort to use meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button i actually hardly ever use that button i ca n't live without the buttons though i find myself other mice thinking they too have those neat little buttons the mouse has a really good response to movement as well i 've used it for gaming as well though i admit i 'm not a hardcore gamer i really recommend this mouse i ca n't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one ||| 1

this is an excellent product if you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you i am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day i have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places the garmin gps 18 plugs right into the usb port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments i 'll admit nroute '' took a little getting used to for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you 're not going to find it but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie instead of spelling hoover street you just type hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations a great buy for only 100 bucks ! if you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of gps dont spend 500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome gps sensor for only 100 ||| 1
obviously there are far better printers on the market but if you 're looking for a quality in the 100 to 150 range this one seems to be at the top of the pack there are nicer printers out there in this price range however you will be severely penalized when it comes to purchasing ink printers tend to be the most friendly when it comes to buying refilled cartridges or refilling your own cartridges it prints fast it prints well and i enjoy the printing feature this printer has been consistently rated by users as being accurate in its color prints although i 've done little color printing myself the scans are not the greatest as they leave small artifacts at regular intervals when you zoom in in photoshop the artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels they 're not really noticeable to the naked eye and you wo n't see them unless you 're editing the picture and have blown it up considerably still it 's probably not the best for archiving your photos i expect there 's a bur on the plastic gear that rolls down the rack pinion however flaws are to be expected in this price range and the listed flaws of this printer are nominal given my research two months ago and performance i 've encountered after purchasing this printer and the ease with which i was able to refill the ink cartridges i 'd say this is the best printer you can buy for 100 as of nov 2006 if you do n't want to be extorted into paying exorbitant ink prices for say an epson ||| 1

note this is a review of the targus retractable phone ethernet cord plastic casing it 's the rectangular model not the oval shaped one i 'm on the road of the time for work and have used this on almost every trip i initially bought it because i forgot my regular network cord while traveling and needed to buy something quickly i like to be able to move around in the hotel room and use this cord along with a cheap little plastic cable joiner to connect it to the hotel internet connection so i can sit on the couch or bed while connected to the internet i 've experimented with a travel wireless router but keep coming back to the wired connection when the wireless connection has problems i 've used it for over a year and have never had any problems with the retraction ||| 1
this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well ||| 1

i have the canon printer and canon rebel xt camera both capable of producing amazing results but paper makes a huuuuge diference in photo printing i have both the canon photo plus glossy and the photo pro papers if you are looking to print out very impressive photos then i would recommend getting the photo plus glossy definitely nice enough to frame and with plus glossy you 're definitely saving instead of paying to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store and i even scanned a professional photo that i had done last year with my and printed using plus glossy and the print is significantly better than the original pros best value canon has to offer great great prints my favorite paper overall as good as pro and less expensive about 55 cents per page in a 30 page pack of pro compared to 40 cents per page in a 20 page pack of plus cons none at all so far have not seen if photos last over time ||| 1
i tested my new canon with a variety of papers like most printers the output is much better when using the manufacture 's own paper as opposed to the cheaper generic paper but there is no need to buy the most expensive pro '' paper as neither i nor my wife could discern any difference between the two there may be a benifit to the pro '' paper that can not be seen lasts longer but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your canon printer i think they look better than the ones i get from the photo lab ||| 1
i 've had this for at least 8 months now we 've used it with xd sd memory stick pro pro duo with the adapter and a few misc cards that friends ' cameras may be using i 've never had a problem getting cards in or out nor any problems with reading the data on them my only possible complaint is that the cap for the usb connector does n't stay on as well as i 'd like or have a place to store it while the device is in use short of that i ca n't place a single complaint about the unit it has been a well spent 20 ||| 1

cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top poorly designed it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it putting it together was a pain the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes designed doesnt even fit cds that well there are gaps and the cd casses are loose fitting pros i guess it can hold a lot of cds ||| 0
it 's a nice look but it tips over very easily it is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows my advice is if you need a cd rack that holds a lot of cd 's save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy ||| 0
i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc '' errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player does n't work it 's essentially useless this is a complete at any price point ||| 0

i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups and the last 5 or so failed i thought it was my software so i got new software guess what my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed too it 's not my burner as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read as it 's brand new and does n't require the firmware upgrade they mention they just suck and have a high failure rate so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best i 'm buying some now and save myself the frustration ||| 0
i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products ||| 0
the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality the only problem is that for every 3 good burns i get one bad one i 'm using the plextor dvd burner love it ! ! but i 'm going to try my luck with a different dvd brand the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable it 's less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters ||| 0
i hope it 's live because if it 's memorex it 's crap ! that 's my latest opinion after using this product i have a liteon and it hates memorex i rarely get a decent burn more often than not i 'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it my movies will skip stutter or stop all together so disappointing ! unfortunately i found out too late that memorex uses cmc media which only has a success rate ! ||| 0
while i read the reviews on this machine it is clear to me that lexar has some serious problems for some people it worked for others it was a miserable failure i am in the latter group sigh mine was dead on arrival i tried the device with of my machines and in both cases it was unrecognized lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help ||| 0
i knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true and sure enough they rejected my upcs i kept copies only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say 'whoops a mistake ' i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional ||| 0
please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date i 've been denied twice the second time they said the u p c number was invalid only it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state all required products were not submitted '' meanwhile i have phoned to lodge a formal complaint the product itself is average i 've used better and worse that said it 's definitely not worth the full asking price ||| 0
no free lunch you get what you pay for is that the verdict on this product well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it i need disc binders and the case logic brand while being the original is pricey low cost alternatives are needed but not at the expense of quality and tco total cost of ownership but the flap about poor customer service rebates and poor quality zippers and sleeve binding is enough to give me pause so if someone from xtreme 's management is paying attention it or be content to lose business price is n't everything to everyone in the markt for your ||| 0

i purchased this game pad due to good reviews found it online for 15 with free shipping so had to try myself its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand the programming software is alright as well not as nice as the nostromo software for example but what i didnt like about it was much more relavant firstly there is a toggle lock shift button this button is easy to press by accident and since it is not a momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian interupting game play also buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb and quite far from normal thumb use i had a hard time using those buttons quickly also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10. and finally for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back and ill soon go with the logitech ||| 0

i purchased dvd express and it never worked i spent endless time with tech support the old story about it must be your computer '' did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it same problems tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money ads also told me it would not work with ulead 's movie factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was uleads problem i should use cap wiz their program duh ! ! ! guess what it did not work with their program either ulead said they had several complaints with ads 's product their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product ! since ads does n't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade i do n't think they want a product like that either the only reason i gave one star is was packed well ju ||| 0

i bought four of these and returned them immediately two were dead out of the box a third had horrible sound after searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products i finally settled on the 900 megahertz wireless intercom from radio shack beautiful sound well made and about half the price of the reporter pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet so if you need more than 300 feet for range it 's something to consider better warranty than the reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year anyway i could n't be happier with the rs intercom i just ca n't recommend the reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty ||| 0
when i purchased these batteries i was very pleased but that wore off after a couple of months i do n't use my camera all that often but when i do i expect ther batteries to have some charge i recharge them per instructions and they do not hold a charge any know monster makes good products but i am a little disappointed in this one ||| 0

in the ten minutes since i 've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off more importantly it ca n't handle large manuals as advertised the reason i purchased this particular book holder my 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter based on that i estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages if you do n't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on keep an eye on the page retainers these are the parts that fell off and you should be as for me i 'm off to read amazon 's return policy and see if i can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic ||| 0

i purchased this memory card for a camera i was also purchasing it was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page when i received the card first and then the camera i was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit because i had opened the plastic package to the card i was unable to return it in fact when i emailed the company who sent it i never even received a response ||| 0
i am the type of person that always buys the extra warranty on whatever i purchase however i started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still had n't received their refund check i was astonished i contacted myself and asked them about this with no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps i was informed that if i did everything by email it would take at least 15 business days that 's three weeks ! to receive my refund check after i sent them the warrantied item if i had them send me a label for the defective item instead of using my own printer it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item in other words it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks ! i cancelled the contract immediately it is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract i would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as grado sennheiser or koss but stay away from these people that 's my feeling and my advice ||| 0
do n't buy this product there simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase since it was 30 days outside the warrantly apple support told me sorry tough luck '' i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong ! second ipod just died same battery problem this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and of course by the time i got in i was past the 12 month warranty period who keeps track of the purchase date i sure did n't other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year it is a fantastic product i 'm just sorry that it did n't last twice ! cause otherwise i 'd be a fan ||| 0
about three years ago maybe four i bought two lexar cfii cards one never worked the other worked but lost all data i wrote to lexar that i had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she did n't care about losing i still have my card in a ziplock none of the file removal programs will get the images off i 've used all of them had their file removal tech help give up in this day age of just make the item '' i am upset but you take your chances do you want the only picture of your great lost because you used a lexar i would n't i use an actual sandisk card myself if they ever lexar made it right i may have written a better review but they have n't so that tells me that they do n't care how important are your pictures to you frederic ||| 0
most people buy a ups plug it in and never test it to make sure it works i tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage i set it to shutdown windows after 1 minute only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it after power was cut it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down then i restored power to the ups after about 30 seconds it beeped clicked and temporarily dropped power to the computer while it was rebooting ! so when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted that is unacceptable a ups should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it ||| 0

i am still awaiting resolution of a problem i have with these drives in writing dvds i get verification errors this proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure the drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the ide bus but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire ||| 0
also import a cd money down the drai ||| 0
the drive arrived at the end of december was quick to get up and running and worked fine until yesterday then it got the machine equivalent of lockjaw '' and i 've been unable to get the tray to release so it 's a good drive while it operates but i 'll probably make sure i pay for at least a warranty on my next purchase as far as my recommendation goes it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one 's drive fails yesterday i just went to a backup burner and kept working if i had needed to get the job done and i had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy i 'd have been in a seething rage computer hardware is never 100 reliable but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year ||| 0
i never even traveled with it it just stopped working completely making me lose data never again i 'll buy anything from this company this drive is a piece of rubbish ! ||| 0
got it at walmart ca n't even remove a scuff i give it -100 good thing i could return it ||| 0
i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better the cd 's were not skipping as much but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a cd changer ||| 0
the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years it lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card it worked just fine for days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable cheap yes but cheap junk ||| 0
great looking keyboard unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed that includes cleaning and do n't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it the keyboard self destructs after you have the count them and of screws i called their customer support they were n't like dell nobody is that bad but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50 off their retail price shipping was extra so you save maybe 10 off street prices they are no longer the good company they were in the past they need competition so i 'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement too bad they do n't make those old keyboards anylonger ||| 0
i ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here big mistake upon setting everything up it all worked great for about two hours then the dreaded '' screen came up now it wo n't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode and no it 's not a short in the wires or overheating it protects even when stone cold and with no speakers plugged in i called sony and they say it is a short in the box so now my two options are to unhook everything repack exactly the way it came to me and reship back to the online store i bought it from with enormous hastle and expense or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center which happens to be across town and only open so much for being convenient this thing is brand new and already needs repairs ! ! on top of that even out of the box none of the video inputs worked audio was fine but video was dead as a doornail right from the start and even on top of the fact that this machine came broken it sucks even when it works right ! the dvds take forever to load and it comes with hdmi out but no hdmi in ! so if you 're an hdmi user i hope you have multiple hdmi inputs on your television one for your cable box one for this crappy system this is a piece of junk for the love of god do n't waste your money ||| 0
why would you want this item amazon is charging 50 more on this item than the generation shuffle ! and according to what i have read this shuffle is n't very derable it does n't even last a year ! i do n't know about you but i 'll get a generation shuffle ||| 0
one day it just stopped working i got the dreaded orange and green flashing lights of death '' the contents of the file space were and i ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that apple likes to keep ||| 0
my shuffle suffered the blinking lights so i took it into the apple store a salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he could n't do anything and said i would have to sign up for a appointment at the genius '' bar at that appointment the genius '' said he could n't fix it and because he said he did n't know anything about engineering he could n't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both apparently being an apple genius '' does n't involve understanding how things work though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut the 'genius '' then offered a 10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle but could n't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing perhaps it should be retitled the idiot bar ||| 0

here is the original review of this machine i wrote on june 17 2006 we bought this machine just over a year ago a year and two weeks to be specific we had another very similar panasonic dvd recorder in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch on both for a long time the recorder worked fine recently though it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks ejecting them and even playing them at first we thought this might be because we 'd recorded over the so many times but today we tested one of them in the other machine which has never made any similar noises and the had no problems with it needless to say we 're not happy that the seems to be dying especially since the warranty just ended if you buy or own this machine follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you 're within the warranty period because the noises and problems just get worse panasonic is usually a reliable brand one we 've used for many years but this machine seems to be a lemon we 're actually going to write to panasonic about it i 'll try to post again with the results here is my update which i wrote november 3 this is a review to the one above which i wrote on june 17. i wrote to panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended they sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair including labor of the machine at one of three places they listed the places were all within a drive of my home after doing some research i chose one and brought in the machine they fixed it by replacing the entire internal mechanism '' i do n't know what that means we got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of july it 's now the beginning of november the fixed machine worked fine for a while but in the past few weeks we 've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before i 'm going to try writing to panasonic again and asking for a refund because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it it 's still working but i know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it wo n't avoid this machine again the previous panasonic model we bought has n't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great we 're still big panasonic fans but this particular model is a lemon ||| 0
i would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months there is a reason the warranty is only 90 days the performance sound quality steadily declines over time the ihome worked great when it was new but it wo n't play songs from the ipod anymore and the radio is a static box ||| 0
so when i first got the ihome for christmas i loved it well i loved it in spite of the glaring bright light that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep however after awhile the ihome will not register my ipods existence at all today i was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again i would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts this device has become nothing more than a nuisance that wo n't even pick up radio stations so the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled useless ||| 0
we have had ours for almost a year it still works great but there is one big problem the display is a bright light great for visibility of the clock when you need it but unfortunately even when it 's on the lowest setting it lights up our whole room ! my husband sleeps through it fine but i need a dark room to fall asleep and i always have to throw a sweater or towel over it we finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio ||| 0
i like the features i 'm satisfied with the sound the user interface could be more intuitive however my overriding complaint is that the docking port as many other reviewers have mentioned is not reliable the connection is poorly constructed so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the ipod is n't there any more if they could fix this quality problem it would be well worth the 100 but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just ca n't justify it at any price ||| 0
i mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would protect my computer from being killed but instead this thing has killed my computer for the second time in 4 days emitting an ca n't turn the feature off shriek alarm how do smart talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an that ca n't be defeated silenced in addition to doing far far more damage than it can ever prevent ask yourself do you want this shriek alarm going off in your house at i bought one apc product and so far they 're 100 defective and 100 deliterious to the use of my computer it 's a matter of time before it 's deliterious to my sleep ||| 0
let 's be honest this product ai n't cheap it 's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working i bought mine at delivery was great only took them a couple of days however my cable was damaged the connector to the was for some reason cut in half without it you ca n't recharge or connect the to the pc i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours no response i sent three to cpenusa no response i do n't care if the product itself is great i 'll never know now will if you 're unable to receive support when you need 'em you 're screwed if you 're just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and do n't really care if you 're on your own go ahead and try it let me know how this thing really is otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to support ||| 0

this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help it is very tempremental and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement so a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so ||| 0
this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you 'd hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod would n't stress the electronics i 'd give this thing 5 stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good ||| 0
this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv which can not turn the tv on and off ||| 0
with a full charge it does not last more than could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera canon the original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge initially i thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all i 'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too ||| 0
i am disappointed in this product i was suppose to write to you from the weekend my two rear speakers just stop working and also my remote control i have replace the batteries but still does not work i do n't have any other rear speakers to try on the system pleasy me what to do thank you epiphane flaviu ||| 0

i 've got a dvdrw burner revision in my fast mac running os x tiger and burning with toast titanium 7. although my burner is nominally it only burns at about in my setup probably due to the slow ata 33 bus it 's on i 've used a number of different brands of and disks both and and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2 so few in fact that i often do n't bother verifying video dvd 's anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs i always verify data dvd 's since errors in those are not ignorable but with memorex i 've gotten about 20 failures including a couple of aborted burns ! in one case the disc had a blank band between two burned ones ! the memorex discs i 'm referring to have manufacturer id cmc mag '' according to these are sold under at least 7 different brand names the reviews there are rather mixed which is not imho good enough ! i have not btw have had any problems with the memorex discs i 've tried but i stopped using them because one of my players wo n't recognize the format ||| 0
i did the research on this product and it was one of the best i do n't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included one if not the only reason i had purchased it i and received no reply if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way ||| 0
this model was intended as a replacement for my and yet quite functional panasonic stereo this is the kind of thing that happens when you browse amazon while drunk late at night unfortunately with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality the sony is in all respects inferior ergonomics appearance and above all fm reception which is laughably poor do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver hiss abounds several local stations i heard previously are now unreachable and to top it off sony has stuck with their habit of using proprietary connectors so when i went to plug in an antenna to get better reception i found a weird little plug that i had n't noticed when i put the damned thing together grrr so now i 'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new panasonic with the proceeds death to sony ||| 0
i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years i purchased three for my mac and pc at home then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit currently only one still works ! i have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down my mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd i ca n't comment on other ups brands such as belkin but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc 's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand my experience over the past four years has been mixed these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor battery life depends on many factors so i do n't begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable i bought apc branded batteries and ca n't explain why the recurrent failures i 'm frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups ||| 0
while the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice feels grippy but not sticky if you know what i mean some of the features are just wrong for instance the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off also for whatever reason the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out the armband is satisfactory at best it 's just a standard no frills velcro armband ||| 0
i was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack they are rated at 2000 mah but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames my 2 year old panasonic 1600 mah in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots i tried these batteries in my player and even there it wo n't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback it is not that the battery does not hold any charge that it has but it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices it seems to be all right for use in a flashlight a set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight a bit dimly for hours yeah i tested it for the test i had charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration it is not a charger issue i plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but one last tip nowadays the best nimh batteries are made by sanyo it is better to pay 2 4 times for them than for a lenmar trust me ||| 0
this product is not for the heavy handed after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs ' on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types ||| 0
this gps comes with us map on the sd card and canada map on the included cd but never the twain shall meet by car i 'm a few hours from canada and several days from the eastern us but i ca n't swap out the faraway eastern us part of the map on the tomtom go 300 for a nearby canadian map it 's either all canada or all contiguous us this is a major functional flaw if you live near the border or live further away and like to take trips oh and if you do decide to swap out the us map be sure to save it on your computer first tomtom does n't bother to provide a backup on the cd so if you do n't first make your own backup before changing to the canadian map you ca n't later get the us map back ||| 0
the tomtom has great features but i returned mine first the maps are very dated this makes it iffy at best it has terrific potential if it worked you can use a pda stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip it 's amazing but i wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it 's internal maps and waypoints but i tried a local test first i used roads as waypoints main roads this way i can force the tomtom to use my routes i did not like it 's choices since it is a dated map database i set up a local route and started to follow it it took me to the first no problem but it would not go past the first waypoint i would go down the road first waypoint then it would tell me to take a u turn ! i did then it said take another u turn it had me going in circles perhaps it 's not made to use roads as waypoints but all indications it gave were that it would the manual was no help support was no help so it went back i have ordered a garmin hope this is i have taken the same trip from se fl usa to sc usa with a garmin the garmin has maps that you can not update but got me to my destination no problem i do n't recommend this tomtom do research go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals hope this helps ||| 0

this is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons 1. this hub will not work with any usb powered devices so forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub 2. extremely slow usb this device is not usb 2.0 compliant 3. it is clunky 4. does not comke with a power adapte ||| 0
i have owned this little hub for at least a year i have an older pc which came without usb so i added a pci adapter i soon realized that i needed more ports and more convenience than the two now located in the backplane of the pc on the floor i shopped around and this item looked appropriate as for the short cord i solved that issue by getting a usb extension cord at the same time besides solving the immediate problem this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point and using the extension cord for some other purpose for a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do i attached an external hard drive through it i used it for a compact flash card reader and a digital camera i connected an inkjet printer everything worked once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly this was all with windows 98 se but after a while things started getting less reliable the system would tell me that various drives '' on the flash card reader or the external hard drive were not available or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software and the printer even started disappearing playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life and eventually i deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose or with wiring inside the device either way it has finally become a big problem and i am shopping for a replacement most of the devices i connected were that is they did not need to draw power from the hub or the pci channel at all the hard drive camera and printer were all powered by batteries or ac adapters of their own and the flash card reader which did draw power from the hub used to work fine it does not matter what combination of devices i try sooner or later the connection goes bad it is of course possible that there 's something wrong in the pc but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself so i have to recommend against buying it i suspect it is discontinued and that this advice wo n't be necessary for much longer but i want to prevent somebody from the bother i 've been through just in case ||| 0

from looking at the website and talking to five tech support staff it appears that there are countless versions of this card each with different driver software the one i got came with a cd with the wrong drivers with tech support i finally found the 8 mb driver file i was supposed to download however they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver the normal automatic '' approach did not work and their instructions did not match the screens i was getting on windows xp sp 2. so i called back again and again and again despite being given a case file each time i was asked the same questions including what exactly is wrong and each time i was told to do the same thing install from the cd reboot remove the program reboot install from the new driver reboot remove the program talk to a senior tech support person install from cd reboot etc it would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the cd a clearly designed website would be second best and tech support that knows what they 're doing and speaks intelligble english would be a nice last resort i spent three hours calling technical support and speaking to five people and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card ! i am not alone in this experience see cnet 's web site user reviews of the another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system i believe he is right it appears to have damaged my screen font for windows message boxes i have been unable to repair it the is bad news i give them two stars cause they actually have tech support though in this case it was utterly worthless back it goes ||| 0
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice ||| 0
i have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that i did or else they wrote their review too soon i bought mine in june 2006. it failed before the store warranty ran out one down the replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and would n't boot two down sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free rma that one also failed three down they replaced it with both a and a the hung after about 2 weeks four down i have been using the for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the replacement arrives i have gotten quite good at the rma game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or i get one of those that other people rave about i do n't think i 'll buy another sandisk unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty i suggest that everyone with a failed to exercise thier warranty rights sandisk needs to know the true reliability of their products ||| 0
we have been unsuccessful with this attachment since we purchased it cards read once and never again does n't matter if we use the gb sp or advance still does n't do anything do n't recommend you waste your money ||| 0
i just cam from las vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that does n't allow for more photos after only using i have tried to format the disk using the camera and through windows xp it does n't allow it to be formatted bad investment ! ! ! would not recommend the product unless there is a way i can get a refund or an exchange ||| 0
the second disc in this package was faulty which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best i have switched to maxell ||| 0
replaced first spindle and still junk will always stick with verbatim from now on ||| 0
i bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site i was very pleased with the purchase then i did n't have one problem with the discs i bought another pack recently and i 've been using the pack i just bought all of the discs are messing up for me i can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you i wish i could send these discs back and get a refund this purchase has scared me away from anything else related to memorex i thought memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers i guess i was wrong and apparently you get what you pay for do n't be fooled by the good price you 'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that would n't even be worth using as a frisbee find another brand to use and avoid this brand ||| 0
was a little hard putting it together you have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart i am not happy with this product ||| 0
i have the older larger version of this product however it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really do n't work right the windows side includes an actual print program which works awfully if you do get this make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint ||| 0
they totally misrepresent this product it does not work with macs i feel cheated and lied to by memorex shame on you ||| 0
after serveral months of use card error '' was shown on my canon digital rebel for my viking card which was half full with pictures fortunately i just lost a few of pictures i tried to format the file card error '' kept occuring on my rebel this viking card is now used for my data files probably viking cards are not designed for high mega pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time 3 my canon has no problems when used with the viking card so far probably i am going to buy a card from sandisk or simple tech ||| 0
i purchased this and am not impressed note that works with all click wheel ipods '' is n't true it does not work with photo ipods at least the 60 gb model i 'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit i 'm ordering a 'photo dock ' since i ca n't see any way to get a cover that is made for the model if i 'd known this i 'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately since i already have a charger came with it grr ||| 0
heres a new one have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer imac intel outdated simply doesnt recognize i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far as i can tell from which i burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one ! for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas ||| 0
the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode in my experience with sandisk i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted so you get rebate 50 of the time with sandisk i think is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies do n't trust it ! ||| 0
i purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight my husband and i both used them and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes they were great at first but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears the inside of my ears were so sore i could n't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out that 's how bad my ears hurt i had the foam pad over them too and it made no difference i would not recommend these ||| 0
this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i would n't take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate ||| 0

i bought the ads upconverter because i bought a hdtv only to find out that my cable did n't offer hdtv and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer hdtv too many trees around my house i was n't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing hdtv picture but for i was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable when i first turned in on i asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought she looked at the tv and said okay i 'm ready turn it on i said it is on ! ! '' this is pretty much the reaction i had also when i looked at it the image i got for my digital cable was certianly different but that 's all it was different it was not noticably better in fact in some instances i though the picture was worse i called ads tech support and they kept insisting i try it with my dvd because that is what the product is best for even though that 's not what i got it for so i did and to be honest i really preferred the picture i got directly from my dvd over the picture i got after running it thru the upconverter it did n't matter what display format i put it in it just did n't do anything to improve the picture save your money if you ca n't get hdtv do n't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing ||| 0
i was impressed with the charger for about 1 month it stopped charging the nimh batteries it came with i took it back to best buy only to find that all of the rapid chargers on thier shelf did not work either a sales person and i tested them all hoping i would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked it was more disappointing after calling kodak were unable to replace it or get my money back i thought purchasing a kodak was a smart decision however they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing ||| 0
i did not read the prior reviews i bought this item loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from the mfg software disc contains two viruses one in quicktime the other in totally hip files target has been notified that the software is corupt with viruses that the mfg has gone out of business this item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no web site access or tech support available for this item ||| 0

as far as i can tell this thing does n't work at all i have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them i should have just replaced the cds ||| 0
how do i assign a rating as several other people have experienced my unit is also doa i received it plugged it in pressed 'clean ' and the motor started up i popped open the cover put in the disc i wanted cleaned and pressed 'clean ' again nothing terrible quality control what 's worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty ||| 0
it did n't work properly from the time it came out of the box the carousel would n't make a complete rotation so cds and dvds would get 'trapped ' inside the unit and occasionally it would simply refuse to play a dvd altogether panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop so maybe they can get it to function as it should if you do purchase one please read the warranty carefully a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones under any circumstances ||| 0
bad disc error possible fix after about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working i kept getting bad disc error on a new dvd i bought i tried good discs that worked before but now got the same bad disc error this is not the first time i had problems loading previously unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem this time after two weeks of bad disc errors i was about to toss it when i decided what the heck i 'll check inside to see if it 's dirty or something first i unplugged the unit i removed the 6 screws holding the cover you may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off with my expertise knowledge i nudged the lense mechanism it apparently slides to read the discs i plugged the dvd in and loaded a disc again to see what happens the lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc i 'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day ! lol so hopefully this will last a little longer but at least i can use it again for now i am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error the viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers ||| 0
hi ! i bought my cyberhome 300 in april 2006 and was able to set the region code to 0 '' to watch all dvd 's after not using the dvd player for a few weeks and unplugging it the region code has automatically set back to 1 '' and i can not change it anymore ! what happened when i try to change it now i can only choose between the settings 1 '' and '' anyone who has the same problem thank yo ||| 0
this item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets do n't waste your money on this piece of crap ||| 0
the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded ||| 0
this unit failed to provide reliable power to my new toshiba satellite laptop it cycled on and off every 3 seconds it powered a 100 watt lamp okay but would n't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 and is rated at 140 watts continuous my laptop power supply is rated at input at vac and if it drew constantly i agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter however even at that power demand the inverter should run it for but only manages 3 sec in addition i doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously i talked to linksys support and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund so i did it did not work for me maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts but i would n't recommend it for more than that ||| 0

when i first started using this i loved it it worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound in fact i bought a second one for my wife then after about two weeks it stopped working it would no longer play in my cassette deck which ejected it as soon as i put it in every time i tried contacting coby 's support on the web but they were unresponsive luckily amazon took it back for a refund note that they no longer sell these directly bet they had too many ||| 0
when this adapter first arrived i thought it was great the sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm adapter there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area the first day i used it for about 20 minutes total did n't have far to drive and it worked great the second day i had a bit farther to drive after about 30 minutes it quit has n't worked again since i did n't expect it to last forever but less than an hour yes it has a 1 year warranty just send the unit back with a money order 6 to cover the return postage of course then you 're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the ||| 0
this dvd player does play all types of dvds no matter how you burn it but like other reviews it stopped working after months in my case it was 3 months it just does n't turn on anymore i unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead i do n't watch dvds much so it 's not like i overused it go with another model this one has problems i thought mines would be the exception but i guess not and now i ca n't return it because it 's been over 30 days ||| 0
the panasonic cd player has a good sound quality but does not automatically change from one cd to the next it requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one cd to another this feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five cd's ||| 0
i 've had the for roughly 14 months the was used for watching movies about once every 2 weeks and big sports event etc the unit worked up to about 1200 hrs then the lamp blew i was hoping to get to at least 1500 hrs before the lamp went out good picture quality for the price 799 but short lamp life get extended warranty check other units first ||| 0

i purchased this wireless card based on the price figuring that even if it did n't live up to the good reviews here i would only be out 20 the set up was easy and smooth but the card wo n't stay connected to my wireless network i 've got a belkin wireless router the trendnet signal meter generally shows signal strength but the connection only lasts for a few minutes and i have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access very annoying i know there 's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop 's connection is stable i purchased a card and it has worked flawlessly unfortunately i threw away the packaging when the trendnet card arrived if i had n't then this card would be on its way back to amazon now like the title of my review says you get what you pay for ||| 0

my company supplies these cordless headsets to its employees so i have alot of experience using headsets this is the latest upgrade and it is the worst unit i have ever used it works great for about 3 or 4 months on average after that the voice unit stops working i can hear others speaking to me but no one can hear me i have gone through 4 of these units in 13 months and the longest lived unit lasted 5 months one broke after 2 months other colleagues have complained about the same thing happening with their units after the experiences i have had with this piece of junk i would never buy anything from plantronics with my own money avoid this rubbish ||| 0
i 'm a cartoonist i need to be able to print color images for clients i bought this printer two years ago from staples for 2500 ! worked great for a couple months after which the toner cartridges started leaking and the print quality rapidly dimished do not buy this printer ! i 'm reluctant to buy anything else from hp knowing that how it performs on the sales floor can be markedly different from how it will perform after a couple months of light use ||| 0
we 've had this printer at my office for about 2 years it 's a giant waste of money magenta cartridges spew toner everywhere cyan cartridges streak it 's even worse when you use the manual feed hp has no answers because they deny all the issues hp 's support is lackluster at best anyway the first time when this machine was under warranty it took me three weeks worth of phone calls to get anything accomplished with them stay away from this printer at all costs if you own one it makes a nice doorstop or paperweight this is totally unacceptable considering toner and printer costs i expect more from a product with the hp brand stamped on the box to bad you ca n't give 0 stars ||| 0
obviously hp has a design flaw on the magenta cartridges i have also experienced leakage from only the magenta why only this one ||| 0
powder from the toner cartridges get all over the inside of the printer and then ruins every page that is printed every page that is printed from my printer has a greyish color due to the powder dirt inside it is impossible to clean it since the powder is everywhere the only way to get it clean would be to bring it to a car wash obviously this would leave the printer with bigger problems than page color what a waste of money ! ! ! good thing my office bought it and not me or i would be furious ||| 0
we travel quite a bit both business and pleasure domestic and international so the idea of a pocket wireless router was a god send we bought this one at the beginning of our annual leave aka tour the us in a month we 'd heard good things about the but with the rebates this one was practically free there was a reason it 's always on sale it took forever to set up the old firmware is buggy the new firmware is difficult and touchy to install the router itself does not seem to be compatible with most personal modems out of the eight houses we were in it would only work with one although it appeared to connect with several others it did work with the ethernet connection of about 70 of the hotels but that 's not a great average it also gets very very hot and than will quit working until it cools down again frustrating after the first week we went out and got the pocket plug it in and it works everywhere personal homes questionable modems hotels etc we have used it from alabama to bangkok and everywhere in between it 's also about half the size of the netgear save the hassle and get it first also a tip pick up a little usb adaptor with your router you will find that many people without a wireless router already will only have a desktop and you will need to make it wireless '' as you will be connecting their modem to your router ||| 0
i hoping to use the to provide wireless encrypted access to two laptops from a wired ethernet connection in a hotel it worked fine in no encryption mode but that is not what i needed i experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with wep or in mode with and without wep one or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection sometimes i had to reboot the laptops sometimes i had to reboot the and sometimes i had to reboot the laptops and the stay away from this product unless single user unencrypted access is what you need ||| 0
my sangean pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use i kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes it worked perfectly on the few occasions when i used it over the 2.5 year period until yesterday the buttons switches and display still work perfectly but only very faint white noise can be heard whether via speaker or via earphone the volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control the batteries are new and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries ||| 0
perhaps i got a lemon but i feel wary of buying another for 2 reasons 1. from the day i got it the power button was so sensitive that a tiny waft of air no kidding would turn it off or back on at whim right in the middle of a song or talk this shortly became maddening since this is unacceptable for a radio and since i did n't want to spend as much money mailing it to and fro as it was worth instead of sending it back oh looking back how i should have ! i opened it up myself and had to physically shave down the plastic underside of the button where it touched the internal power switch as i could n't conversely move the guts further from the button this was the only solution thankfully this worked and the button did not give me further problems after this however 2. not many weeks or months of use in the radio developed this habit of shorting out or something to where my stations just scanned as blank 'fuzz ' no station not even 'intelligent ' like it knew a station existed anywhere on the planet and i could get zero stations of anything at all not fm not am and no tv this would happen right after turning the radio on and i should note that i always used headphones not the ones supplied as with most throw them away they 're not worth it it seemed to me through trial and error that just turning the radio on was fine but the act of plugging in some headphones joggled some connection or shorted something out and did this i tried several different pair and types of headphones some with noise cancelling switches some without and with these on and off and used the 'lock ' switch on the radio both in the on and off position while plugging in my headphones as the company i bought them from recommended turning the lock switch on when changing batteries to prevent shorts but nothing i have done has prevented this from eventually happening again repeatedly it is really annoying when it does as removing the batteries which always will lose all your presets by the way and waiting several minutes rarely clears the short weirdly the thing i 've found which clears the short or whatever connection is messed up correct itself is opening up the back screwdriver required and kind of pushing the guts board one direction or another kind of scooting it there 's minimal movement available though and saying a little prayer and putting the whole thing back together again most of the time that has worked occasionally i 've had to repeat the process times before it will sometimes it lasts several weeks before this 'll happen again other times it happens multiple times a day the day i ca n't fix it i do n't even know what i 'm doing that 's fixing it ! i 'll throw it across the room against a wall and i probably buy another one if i do i 'm keeping the receipt never opening up the back as it voids any warranty and returning it not for repairs for a refund ! the split second it gives me any trouble of any kind for all this i grudgingly say that it does have very good reception quality of fm i almost exclusively listen to this pulls the stations in nicely and has very low amount of static when one particular station does it 's usually more the fault of distance or we 're getting out of range or the batteries are very that 's at fault indoors in a environment and not near a window though i 'd have to say it has had some significant problems pulling in any more than stations without major static but your office environs may vary some are more electrical field saturated than most the fm musical sound quality itself is and i might say better than many but my 1 criticism on it is a certain 'canniness ' of sound quality across various headphones i 've plugged in it 's lacking some fullness of the midrange and warmth also the bass is not what it could be i 'm not sure given its overall sound quality signature if the addition of a bass boost button would have helped it or not for me clarity and volume have helped me ignore some of the lesser aspects of the 's sound signature however shopping for my next purchase that will move up higher in importance ||| 0
this has to be the worst keyboard i 've purchased it 's my first wireless i 've used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this with the added plastic palm rest it sets the base up too high without it there is a 'hump ' where your palms go that puts your hands an an uncomfortable angle the plastic is really bad it feels really cheap and slick before i purchased this i had been trying to get in tough with logitech about their products and compatability but they never bothered to respond so bad product on the slide n't add up to a good value logitech used to be the best company out there or at least one of the best ||| 0
though i like the keyboard i 've found two serious problems with the mouse first it is very sensitive to movement i 've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control finally and more importantly the mouse burns a set of aa batteries about every 8 days i only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so i should be getting a lot more battery life i 've bought other logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case i wish i had bought another brand ||| 0
note to everyone who is having problems with this card i reformatted it in my camera and it works fine now ! ! initially i wrote i was very disappointed in the speed with this card using a minolta xg the panasonic card that came with the camera which i thought would be cheap is three times faster than this upgrade '' this card is useless to me as it cripples the camera i bought it to work in it takes fourteen seconds from one shot to the next with this card with the original card it 's less than four seconds the claim that this is a high speed '' card is dishonest this is the slowest card i 've ever used i will throw this card away rather than curse someone else with it ||| 0

after reading the detailed reports here for how to setup this linksys gaming adapter unit everything worked great for several days i setup the fixed ips and all the rest of the settings through the web interface all seemed well note i 'm a network engineer so the recommendation one for each segment is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances i suspect the ms game adapter simply performs the dhcp handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup then the weird stuff started after having had this unit turned on for several days i notice the connection would become slow and not quite as fast as when the linksys is first turned on yet the xbox still shows the signal between 48 and 54 mbps strange i have reproduced this several times booting the linksys device then playing all kinds of games online for hours running xbmc and playing media through the network perfectly all is good for several hours but come back the next day after leaving the linksys on all turn on the xbox and the network connection is spotty again but the link details show a full speed connection in the xbox wireless interface details a swift power cycle of the linksys unit solves the problem immediately but why should i need to do this i suspect some nic buffer is being filled on the linksys and the power cycle clears out the unit 's network buffers if anyone has figured out what settings to use to keep this thing stable i am ready to listen maybe i should select a network and set the speed at 54 or 48 fixed maybe that will work anyway i am getting tired of power cycling this thing every day good luck f ||| 0
i purchased this device to add to my wireless network which uses a belkin wireless router i had to connect the router directly to the game adapter since it could not be detected by my wireless router after configuring it i could never find it once it was disconnected from the ethernet cable from my wireless router i made three attempts at customer service my first call was disconnected after 20 minutes the second call was working with a woman in india who 's headset had a ton of static to add to her accent i had to end that session because we could n't hear each other i then used online chat and after 90 minutes i still had not solved my problem and that session was disconnected for unknown reasons the lady from india did mention that mixing their product with any other wireless router would be a problem and now i believe her ||| 0
do n't buy it ! i bought a koss dvd player and it broke in 6 months i was told i was out of luck because the warranty is only 90 days they do not do repairs my only option is to buy a new one and was n't even offered a discounted price for it i have seen several complaints like mine about koss on the web they make junk and they make it to last just to get past the warranty period and then it breaks oh by the way i loved it until it broke ||| 0
i recently purchased a refurbished toshiba gigabeat for about 150 quite a bargain for a player however upon reflection i regret the purchase the gigabeat hardware seems to be ok with good sound quality etc the major failing is with the included software as other reviews have pointed out the gigabeat will only play encrypted tracks the gigabeat is supplied with gigabeat room application software to provide the necessary encryption gigabeat room starts automatically when connected to the pc via the usb port from the time the gigabeat is connected till the gigabeat room application is displayed on the screen is 30 minutes if you switch from viewing the gigabeat file directory to the pc file directory the application hangs if you try to update your track library the application hangs i have yet to get through a single operation from beginning to end without the program hanging every time the gigabeat room hangs you have to restart the application with yet another wait to resume the file directory on the gigabeat is usually out of sync with what is actually present on the hard drive microsoft media player version 10 may also be used to synchronize the gigabeat i have a library it took media player 18 hours to encrypt and copy all 8100 tracks to the gigabeat in short be prepared for a maddening and time consuming experience with this player software that gives error messages such as the program is quitted '' and with such obvious fragility may have been expected in 1986 but is absolutely unreasonable in 2006. in my estimation you would be much better off purchasing an player even at greater cost that can play files directly with file maintenance provided by windows explorer and or media player ||| 0

i replaced a siemens 8825 with the motorola 7081 and was unfortunately really disappointed the 8825 while rich in function is quite lacking in quality so what 's good about the 7081 is 1. great design and feel especially the handset 2. nice look to the unit 3. displays 4. easy to understand voice prompts when accessing remotely 5. reasonable range 6. nice feel to the buttons 7. fairly easy to go through the setup 8. ability to sort the phonebook alphabetically 9. base has phonebook that can be shared by the handsets 10. motorola customer support excellent now what 's not good 1. even at maximum volume you can barely hear the speakerphone on the base 2. sound on the handset is distorted fuzzy the person on the other end hears a hiss the volume is adequate but barely 3. can not search the phonebook if you sorted it alphabetically and need to access a name starting with z '' you have to scroll through the entire phonebook 4. ca n't record an outgoing message remotely 5. battery level indicator on handset is useless when the handset is in the charging cradle it shows a charging indication at all times when it is out of the cradle it does n't show anything i really wanted to like this unit because it has such a nice look and feel to it but the poor sound quality is a showstopper ||| 0
i have had this phone for 20 hours and am returning it there is static noise on the line when people talk on the other end the echo of my voice from the earpiece is very distracting i find it very disconcerting the wall mount bracket causes the base to stick straight out from the wall and as a previous reviewer mentioned is usually up to your nose given the location of most wall mounts this strikes me as an unexcusable oversight on motorola 's part either make it desk only or do the wall mount right the speaker for the speakerphone feature is in the back of the phone while the microphone is in the front of the phone dumb design i feel like i 'm either not listening or not being picked up when talking the volume on the base speakerphone is too low at highest setting i 'm very disappointed in this phone much like a previous reviewer the 1 star is only because i could n't give it a 0 star rating ||| 0
after using rca and creative both suck i decided to try an ipod this one since only a moron watches video on a inch screen itunes does n't like m too much i guess itunes is really crappy software if you have a big wma audio collection go elsewhere conversion causes sound quality loss especially if you ripped at protected files ca n't be converted so you have to burn to a cd then let itunes rip it if you do n't use itunes to buy music 5 stars if you do 1 star the ipod which i returned after discovering it would take months to convert to ipod compatibility is flawlessly designed and takes a licking google itunes problems '' and you 'll find a lot of hate for itunes my problem why not support wma files ipod would grab 99 of the market if they did and kill the upcoming m player that will even play itunes stuff ||| 0

avoid this product at all costs ! ! ! i should 've listened to the other reviews but noooo i just had to see it for myself this product worked barely for 2 weeks then just totally died in the short time that it worked the sound quality was just horrible no matter what free channel you play it on i have a good 40 mile drive one way not city or metropolitan driving and in that span i 'll have to switch channels between 3 to 5 times kudos to amazon 's hassle free return policy i was able to return it and get the belkin tunebase fm which i highly recommend ||| 0
not at all durable due to very very cheap construction i had to massage my batteries to get the speakers to play a total waste of time to purchase try to use and return could n't even give these away ||| 0
i have a voip setup with voicepulse this phone works great as long as i do n't assign phone numbers to the presets when i do it stops ringing after a few days the lights flash indicating an incoming call and i can answer the phone if i notice the lights flashing but it does n't ring if i reset the phone to defaults erasing all presets then it works i got a new one from at t and it does the same thing i love the headset button to switch between speaker and headset let me know if you know a workaround ||| 0
callers can barely hear me even with the mic right in my mouth volume adjustment on cord doesnt affect it and even worse callers hear an echo of themselves the mic picks up the caller in the earpiece enough to resend it ! echo ! must be because its all on the same arm or something crappy this makes it basically unusable so waste of money throw away going to buy a better one ||| 0
this item is not described correctly this item is not for garmin or any of the c line i had to returned it at my own expense amazon please correct the description of the item ||| 0
on the back of the package it says 1 transparent sound and powerful bass the transparent sound '' part is true and powerful bass '' part is totally untrue 2 metal stabilized system for high levels what was that again metal stabilized system it has antiroll crossbars i guess ! ! when companies start making vague claims about their product thats when you know that there is a problem these sounded terrible at first no bass period the sound changed for the better once i put on the foam covers i could hear some bass at that point but even after equalization it was clear that this product is designed to deliver a lot of high frequency decent midrange but little by way of bass even though it claims to have frequency response going from to it fits my ears properly so that is not a problem this product sounds far inferior to a pair of aiwa '' that came with a made in japan '' walkman purchased in 1990 ! i would n't even compare the sound of these to the excellent koss over the ear headphones i purchased recently maybe they are better than the ipod headphones which suck even worse and the reason people give this 5 stars really no more than a 2 star product expected much better from sennheiser with this experience i 've decided not to go for their noise cancelling headphone and instead go with the one from panasonic reputable companies should think twice before selling junk in the marketplace ||| 0

i like the dish networks technology and the potential that it could be one dvr which covers two rooms is great the picture is clear when it works the are intuitive the pricing is reasonable but my complaint is reliability and support for the two years i have had dish my tv picture seems to go out every 6 months or so everytime i talk to dish customer service i get a different reason why it could be out several times i have gotten new dvr boxes mailed to me and there is always a dispute about who should pay several times i have had dish net come out to my house and they have always tried to make me pay until i told them i 'm tired of the hassel and just cancel me now my dish is out again this weekend and i am missing the ohio state michigan game because my tv says no dish signal reason tbd anyway if it worked consistently as advertised i would give it 4 or 5 stars but due to reliability i give it 2 stars and with murphy 's law it always goes down when you want to watch that big event prompting me to write this review instead of watching the game today ! ! i may have to switch back to cable san jose ca ||| 0

all ports began running slow after just 6 months of use followed linksys rma process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake i followed yet another linksys rma process and had to wait two months for the replacement switch covering their mistake the replacement switch died after 1 week of use the latest rma unit ran excessively hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up this is what i have learned about linksys 1 this should be a simple network device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly linksys apparently can not make a good one 2 do not even think about turning a broken unit into linksys under their rma process they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it can not be trusted if these cheap switches fail they can not be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place 3 choose a competitors product i have had other brand switches running for years with no issues ||| 0

i am a long time pc user and pc gamer i wanted this for a 1. tv 2. pc gaming monitor 3. xbox gaming monitor 4. dvd veiwing device here is how i rate this monitor on these four levels on a scale of 1 to 5 1. tv 2 2. pc gaming monitor 2 3. xbox 1 4. dvd 3 the ghosting for normal operations is almost too much to live with i returned this item just so you know the rca inputs gave me only black and white images this could have been because my monitor was defective i am not sure ghosting during gaming was very bad worse than that was it 's lack of good brightness control this is not for gamers ||| 0
the only reason i bought this unit when i saw it in the store was for the ipod controller feature i really looked forward to being able to control my ipod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight boy was i disappointed ! the ipod adpater works and all but barely it takes forever to scroll through the songs artists or albums why the hell would alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the ipod so you ca n't even select songs from the ipod itself i have over 3000 songs on my ipod by the time i scroll to the song i want i 've already reached my destination and that 's if i even find the song at all ! so now what i have to do is unplug my ipod scroll to the song i want then plug it back in luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your ipod in but again that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck bottom line the ipod control feature flat sucks the deck features a quick search '' function but it is uselss it is n't used to search through artsts or albums only individual songs and there 's no way to skip 10 20 30 or 100 songs at a time only 1 by 1 what 's quick '' about that i have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and alpine thinks i 'm supposed to go through them 1 by 1 another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the ipod is playing the display just says song up '' or song down '' instead of just showing the name of the damn song ! who thought of that what possible help could song up '' be to anyone just show the name of the song while i 'm skipping through that makes more sense right there are a bunch of other problems i have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the ipod adapter and ipod but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing but then again who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to ||| 0
i bought an alpine 9847 and the ipod interface i works but it totally hijacks your ipod the beautiful intuitve fast controls on the ipod itself are locked out and you can only control the ipod from the car stereo it is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you ipod it is very slow not at all intuitive even after getting used to it it is no good the info on artist album or song title imports from the ipod very slowly turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever annoying very slow very cumbersome if only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the ipod itself a better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in either stereo mini plug or rca jacks the just connect directly and use the ipods own controls which are infinitely better i replace an old stereo to get the ipod option and am very sorry i did so ||| 0
the only thing this item is good for is charging your ipod the transmitter is so weak all you hear is static buzz with muffled music in the background do n't waste your money and do n't expect any help from the manufacturer who refuses to answer emails or accept a warranty return ||| 0

mine worked pretty well for about the first 50 labels that i made then the font size got stuck ridiculously small so that the message only covers about 10 percent of the tape surface if you want really small labels with a font size you could use my to print them out and then cut down with scissors to eliminate all of the wasted label area ||| 0
i just purchased this product in the instruction manual it states that only the brother ac adapter should be used and any other will invalidate the warranty why is it that only a brother adapter can be used when ac adapters are supposed to be standard a tactic to increase sales the adapter itself costs an additional 15 to 20 dollars in addition i agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off the 2 line printing does look very nice i have not used many of the other features and so can not comment on those ||| 0
do n't even accept it as a freebie as i did unless you are prepared to pay 1.15 per sheet for color ink that was my experience with the first color cartridge which was fully consumed on a total of 20 sheets 12 of which were heavy color the others being mixed color and text or very light color at 17.99 per color cartridge and 14.99 for black i calculate the outrageous obscene 1.15 per sheet figure for ink this is about six times greater than the average ink cost for my old which unfortunately does not work with my new hp pavilion pc no printer port on this model among other issues i have vowed to not purchase any hp product in the future if i can possibly avoid it i just ordered a canon pixima to replace this ink hog on the positive side the print quality is good speed is excellent and color fidelity is fair the software installed without incident and the machine is easy to operate but the hp software is overbearing and constantly trying to sell you something worse than daytime television ||| 0
bought this printer and the install disc was bad prints test page every time i turn it on wo n't print jobs get stuck and can not cancel spoke with customer service for 1.5 hours ! yes that long they would not refund me and told me that i should have did a better job researching their products they got that right all i could get was a refurbished replacement that also performs like crap hp has lost a customer forever and i am making it my mission to share with everyone how terrible they are with products and customer service canon meet your next customer ||| 0
this bracket will not fit the etrex vista cx this is because the battery cover supplied with the bracket replaces the original battery cover to provide attachement lugs will not clear the microsd card socket this is very frustrating because the garmin website even shows this bracket part number in the etrex vista cx accessories list so if you have a cx do n't purchase this item ||| 0

we have bought 3 of these vtech phones for our house since the begining we have had battery problems it is really annoying when you have to make a phone call and your phone does n't work because of the battery at any point in time at least one of the phones constantly reports a low charge '' or no battery '' message which means you ca n't use that phone of course you can hear the ring from the phone that is never at the same room that you are so you have to run to pick up the other phone since the one in your location has the no battery problem as other reviewers have noted this in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time on the beginning we used to take the battery out of phone and put it back in that does n't quite work anymore i tried to get support but you ca n't get a live person at the vtech number on their website they suggest replacing the batteries but they are rechargeable so how many times are we really supposed to buy new rechargeable baterries i have already replaced it once i know we wont buy vtech products again ||| 0
it 's not often i find a product that 's as disappointing as this the interference problem is very serious and makes most conversations a pain moving around the house and outside of the house standing on your head holding the phone at a 45 angle are part of the daily ritual in trying to hold a legibible conversation but that 's not the bad part the bad part as at least one other reviewer has noted is that each of the phones constantly reports a low charge '' message or something similar this in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time the only solution i 've found is to take the battery out of phone and put it back in then it will work for a day or two i suppose it could be just the batteries but if so then we were shipped batteries that were already on i read a few good reviews of this phone and of course there are a number right here but out experience has been the opposite the phones have been nothing other than a pain ||| 0
i picked up this headset telephone because i am spending more and more time on the phone almost immediately after plugging it in everyone i called asked me to speak up repeat what i said and that they could not hear me very well when i attempted to setup a new voicemail system i found out why the headphone is amplified but the microphone is not no matter how loud i spoke or shouted the audio is severely suppressed and barely audible simply stated this product is not usable ||| 0
i had this for approximately 2 years it worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances one day i left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour during this period the alarm was activated and i was embarrased to face my office workers this is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm i sent it back to targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm but after several months it started the same problem so now i am afraid to use this security system with my laptop but i did not face problems like changing the combination by its own you can use it without the alarm activation without batteries but the cable is so thin it is not recommended to protect any valubles ||| 0
i bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good macintosh support unfortunately the player does not work well with the macintosh the included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import dss files the software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window the use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from windows the appears to the finder as a standard usb disk and i have been able to copy the dss files from the player to the compuer using the finder it is then possible to play the dss files by double clicking them but it will only play one file if you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the dss player and relanch it exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as aiff is also nearly impossible there is an export function in the menu when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears unfortunately there is no other macintosh software available to read or convert dss files as olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the macintosh search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the dss files such as playing the entire file and it with another program ||| 0
great sound but the build quality is just not there on a recent trip to europe the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver they are only two months old and i always keep them in the case ! i had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together since then i 've also had to superglue the right bud as well also the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead revealing the fine speaker wire underneath i do n't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad they are great sounding and comfortable but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners be warned ||| 0
these headphones are so expensive and they are aweful ! i dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other its very annoying ! i tried to loosen it and the wire was showing what a piece of its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when i listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily they are too expensive for a piece of junk ! the only reason i rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones instead purchase the sony sports walkman street style headphone radio i purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better SMILE ||| 0
i so wanted to love this thing i have an ipod that i am seldom without and my car is n't ipod compatible i bought a monster wireless fm so i could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion unfortunately the thing just did n't work for me there are 8 preset stations low on the dial and if all of them are in use you 're out of luck i do n't live in a huge city maybe with farmland all around but only two of these stations were available although i was able to tune in to my ipod it was n't crystal clear in fact it was n't even plastic clear the static sometimes overrode the music which drove me nuts this is like a fax machine the original may be spotless but the fax will be a little fuzzy if you have a cassette player in your car there are adapters that go through the cassette player and are much better if your car is n't ipod compatible and you do n't have a cassette player you 're better off just burning a bunch of cd's ||| 0

if you got a crappy brand tv like the samsung the east meadow guy got you might need a cable like this to make the image quality acceptable but if you have a namebrand tv like sony or sharp or philips or toshiba or panasonic a 15 cable totally suffices this monster cable is no better than the 15 guy also available on amazon just search for hdmi dvi cable '' do n't waste your money ||| 0

not a particularly easy lock to use combo part rotates freely when not in computer making it difficult to set the combo also changing combo is very easy to do accidently however this is usually not a problem because it is incredibly easy to figure out the combo i am not a professional lock picker and i am able to break the combo without any difficulty which is a problem with many low quality combo locks but this design try to avoid it at all i 've noticed a lot of people have a problem with the lock spontaneously '' changing combinations it 's probably not because the lock is defective it 's probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage i would definitely never suggest this product to anyone unless i really wanted their computer ||| 0

i read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport and low ambient sound headpohones without breaking the bank i 'm on a plane frequently i wanted something that i would n't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels i found that the uneven cord lengths are very especially if you like to use only one plug like maybe at your desk at work the weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite even when sitting still so then i thought these will be great workout headphones wo n't be upset if i break or lose them however the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand the effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience even when you are sitting stationary at your desk it is similar to wearing a stethescope which defeats the point of wearing headphones which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise i do not recommend these headphones because of this stethescope i could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses they are after all designed to wear behind the head i 'm on the hunt for better quality headphones ||| 0
i like this style of headphone radio especially when i jog and have n't found any similar models that i like this is my third purchase of this radio each of the three have had problems first died completely although it was used a lot second still works but last number does n't show up on digital display i wanted a backup in case second died so i ordered another one this third works least well of all at times entire display is off radio does n't work at all or it wo n't change channels then other times it worked seems like might be affected by heat outside however i know have another persistent problem that being it wo n't let me program the preset stations again i 'm limited in my choices and i use this type headphone a lot so i suffer through poor quality ||| 0

isolation i had to use the foam inserts because the plastic ones were a little too large for my ears with the foam it completely sealed my ear canal and blocked out most noise my commute home on the j train was quite silent i was listening to classical music for the first time on the train with earbuds i had to put the volume level around 50 with the sony model i could to keep it around 40 the noise attenuation was n't that good with the sony model but definitely better than earbuds but the sound quality was quite terrible though sound quality superb sound the partnership with etymotic research is evident everything sounded great rock grunge classical the sonys sounded really muddy while these had a really bright sound with good bass when the seal was good very balanced sound i string my earphones through an rei one jacket so this was more or less perfect length the cord is symmetric so it 's not weirdly strung behind your neck like the sonys and the connection to the ear pieces is solid not like the the earphones connect to the replaceable eartips very tightly the included case is ridiculous though it 's way too bulky for portability sadly this is primary reason i 'm returning these both the flanged rubber tips and the included foam tips were too big the foam models got the seal but they were too big so i felt an uncomfortable amount of pressure in my ear canals those were my only two options with the included package the other problem is that i can not find replacements that are smaller anywhere on the web including the altec lansing site documentation another reason i am returning these is the documentation the manual says that i can get replacement ear tips and accessories at and i get a 404 error when i visit the link that is pretty pathetic update i emailed altec lansing regarding this issue on and i have yet to get a response from them bottom line if you have large ears these may suit you but if you know that you have smaller ears then stay away from these and go for something else ||| 0
i bought these to replace the standard ipod and sony ear buds i was under the impression that i would get a much deeper bass response i was wrong the bass reproduction is simply horrid i read somewhere there is a '' period i have found this not to be true they sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new this is my first pair of sennheiser and am very disappointed i know they are headphones but i expected more my recommendation is to keep researching ||| 0

during the installation of the software on my pc running windows 2000 server the installation program froze my pc completely i had to turn off the pc and now it does nothing when i turn it on the lights on the front light up but nothing happens at all i called netgear waited on hold for 15 minutes and then was connected to a gentleman whose english was not very good i explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it he told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with win 2000 server i told him that i had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 pro but not 2000 server perhaps there are some but he insisted that this was the case i explained that typically installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user and exit rather than freezing and disabling the computer but he held firm and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help and that he recommended that i contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration i went around and around with this fellow then finally asked for his supervisor after another 15 minutes on hold another guy came on the line who was pretty fluent in english he explained his understanding of the situation which was still wrong and i explained the whole thing again to him he had me turn the computer on and off which of course i had already done several times and check the monitor connection after this analysis he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it and must be some other problem with my pc that had previously been working perfectly that coincidently occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze i expressed skepticism towards this explanation and asked him if he would believe that if it was his pc he said that absolutely he would and reassured me that there was no possible way emphasis his that his software could have caused these symptoms since i understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone i suggested that i could take it to a local technician and send netgear the bill for repairing my system he declined that offer so at the end of the day i 'm left with a dead pc but according to netgear a perfectly good wireless card and installation cd no more netgear for me thank you ! ||| 0
i am totally stunned that this could be sold as ipod compatible nothing absolutely nothing works as you would intuitively think it would pause does not pause forward arrow does not forward to the next track just starts the same track over and over again and heaven help you if you actually want to find a specific song or artist there is no way to actually speed through a menu you have to advance one artist at a time this is fine if you love aaron neville but chances are you will be in a limb severing accident if you are trying to get to zz top i am taking this back tomorrow and demanding something that will allow me to control my ipod again from my ipod ||| 0
i guess for 50 this is an ok product i am usually very against monster products but i 'd seen this for almost double at big box retailers needed a surge protector for my new dlp tv so figured what the heck it arrived without incident i hooked it up and so far so good it basically a power strip with labels that also happens to be purple for the neato '' effect i guess anyways no idea if its worth more than your run of the mill surge protector but the claims of independent circuitry to minimize is what i was really interested in as i have my reciever cable box dvd player and subwoofer all connected all in all a good buy i guess at least you paid a lot less than retail ||| 0
i bought one of these a few months ago it worked perfectly with my old thinkpad but not long thereafter i got a thinkpad thinking hey universal means universal of course it will work '' but no six months after the was introduced kensington still has n't gotten their act together to produce a smarttip '' for it they have n't even added lenovo to the list of manufacturers on their web site ! all customer service can say is that they do n't have one they do n't know when or if they ever will and they suggest that i check back on the website someday if i still hold out any hope so i have a 100 brick on my hands very disappointing kensington it 's really too bad the unit is lightweight sleek and functional and unlike some reviewrs i think the cord was brilliant and it does n't get tangled up in my briefcase the cables are much nicer than on my igo supply and the connectors do n't break like they did on the igo and it 's not like there 's some technical problem the needs 20 volts 90 watts well within the capability of this unit however six months delay in supporting a major business computer brand is just unforgivable so i can no longer recommend it ||| 0
i wanted to get something better than the standard earphones for my ipod i saw some good reviews and this brand has been known always for great headphones bought these and was shocked at the terrible sound quality yes the sound is clean but too clean the highs are too high leading to tinny and sound voices have too much hiss there is virtually no low end bass of any type very disappointing ||| 0

i am looking for a system to replace a siemens 8825. the 8825 has in my opinion the best set of functions of anything currently available but i have some reliability issues with it i first tried the motorola 7081 and found that unsatisfactory my next attempt was the panasonic this phone has decent volume and clarity at the base the handset has good clarity and range but the volume could use a little help the base layout is ok but the way you turn on the answering machine at the base is silly the handset feels light and chintzy the clarity of the outgoing messages on the answering machine is poor the base is ugly what were they thinking anyway it ok not wonderful but since i could n't get the answering machine to save messages on either line it 's defective i sent it back back to the drawing board ||| 0
it did not work at all and amazon would not take it back saying it was my responsibility that it did not work i would never buy this or any other product from this seller ||| 0
i was excited about consolidating 3 remote controls i regularly use plus my fan and light controls however the harmony 890 has proved to be a big disappointment i was much better off with the 3 remotes i was using before it was much simpler than fooling with the harmony remote which requires so many key presses for basic functions i never have been able to get the harmony to control the fan and lights some reviewers have said that you just need to take time to do the programming properly even if you do in my case it 's just easier to juggle my 3 remotes and press one button to do what it would take with several key presses on the harmony my harmony is now going to sit with the other remotes i never use and i 'll just stick to the 3 that work for me ||| 0
before you buy this drive be sure to google cypress '' and western digital '' until yesterday i recommended this drive to everyone then my drive failed prompting me for new hardware and to install a driver for cypress it appears that there is a chip in the drive housing manufactured by cypress that is failing in drives left and right class action suit anyone the western digital support staff is no help act like they have never heard of this error offer no option to just switch out the housing will replace but you lose all the data there are 30 replacement housings available but you void your warranty bottom line if you buy this drive be prepared for it to fail keep everything backed up because there will come a day that this drive will fail ||| 0
while convenient and a nice lightweight unit the voice pickup is very poor regardless of how you adjust the set this is not only with the set i have used but with others i have talked to you can tell if the person on the other end of the phone is using one of these units because they are so faint i 've gotten so i just ask if they 're using a plantronics when they are faint and the answer is invariably yes '' also if you are in a building with a lot of exposed metal frames high cubicles with lots of metal the range deteriorates significantly ||| 0
for some years i tried this and other monster products to the tune of over 1000 in monster gear the more you learn about video and audio the more you 'll avoid anything with the monster label specifically this meets no ntsc dvd or ieee standard it is common hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding has a sharp image but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from skin tones to color blotching dirty grays burned highlights murky shadows noisy reds and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds makes video test patterns look great but who watches test patterns all day amazon offers many other brands at good prices why waste your on this stuff i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar belden viewsonics and others from amazon result vast improvement in every respect ||| 0
i recently purchased this item from sharper image and was very disappointed the video is faint grainy even in strong lighting and out of focus once you are more than 2 feet away from the camera colors all but disappear it 's practically video the power supply weighs more than the device itself one pound including cord and is huge it also gets very warm after an hour or so i 've tested this product in every type of lighting situation and the results have been unsatisfactory in all cases the only thing the device does well is detect motion ||| 0
i bought this adapter along with the linksys broadband router i managed to set them up and install them properly the best advice i got from the home networking for dummies '' book was to get a 100 foot patch cable so that i could put my router in the place i where i wanted it and hook it up with a wired connection first i actually only needed a 50 foot cable and got it for 20 from a local electronics supply store so i got everything up and running remember to install your router first and then your network adapter surfed the internet for awhile and then shut down my computer here 's where the trouble started as other reviewers have noted the linksys installation makes changes to your windows xp configuration the welcome screen and the feature microsoft calls fast user switching '' this happens with no warning when i went to turn on my computer again i got a new screen for windows demanding a password i freaked out because i do n't remember ever setting a password for windows i called linksys and was extremely unimpressed with their customer support the young woman seemed to be amused by my problem and was actually laughing at me she began to start me through the process of completely the router to the factory settings this would not have helped what finally helped was figuring out with no help from linksys that if you never set a password for your windows xp logon all you have to do is hit enter '' at the password prompt that 's all there is linksys could have told me this or better yet warned before installation that these changes to windows xp would take place and suggest setting up a user password in advance another gripe about this network adapter and the linksys router neither came with instruction manuals there is a instruction manual on the cd rom that comes with the product but you 'll have to print it out yourself do it before you install or try installing the product in the case of the router i also had to do deep searching to actually find the instruction manual on the it wanted to start up the setup wizard automatically and the instruction manual was not easy to access from the i guess this may be the norm now with computer hardware but it still stinks i do not recommend the linksys primarily because of the unannounced changes it makes to the windows xp system and because of linksys ' or and rude customer support ||| 0
i have owned the tomtom navigator 5 for almost a year now while the program is well thought out and provides a good function it does not work well with my tungsten i have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues listed below but to no avail some of the issues i have had any time the software has to redirect or think it locks up if i stay on the original planned route it sometimes works properly in a 30 minute trip from orange county to long beach i had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up voices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device in a 20 minute trip from san francisco to oakland the device locked up 5 times i finally gave up and called a friend to guide me bear in mind i have had no problems with my in the 1.5 years of ownership it is only with this software customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing in summary it 's not worth spending the money to have to print out mapquest directions to have when the device crashes stick with mapquest ||| 0
essentially once tomtom has your money they 're finished with you until you want to spend more money with them the product is okay the map data is from teleatlas a vendor to many of the map software producers what makes tomtom different is its gui graphic user interface that the user interacts with it really is a work of art most of the time the map presentations are rich and may be viewed as or the planning interface is icon driven and unfortunately tomtom really did n't think it all the way through there are several irritants all of which vie for first place one is that tomtom does n't give you the option of using its maps without a gps there are many instances where i know where i am begining from and going to and i do n't need a gps fix tomtom ignores such desires and annoyingly keeps prompting for you to start your bluetooth connection there is one mode that you can use to plan a route without a gps and it simply does n't work very well often informing you that tomtom ca n't route you from a point beginning on an interstate to another point further along the same highway that 's just plain dumb this is a mapping application if i want to use these expensive maps for walking directions without a gps i should be able to tomtom certainly does n't think so another irritant is the documentation probably in an effort to make tomtom appealing to the casual user the documentation is dog simple and often wrong it appears that they did n't update the documentation to the newest version although you can load maps by region tomtom makes no allowance for travelling from one region to another you have to calculate your route to the ending point within one region and then begin it anew in the next region again this strikes me as a silly omission if you are in wisconsin which is one region and drive to minnesota which is in another you have to create two routes not bright there are a number of idiosyncracies anomalies and bugs that drive me up a wall however overall tomtom is still better than the competition it computes routes quickly when it is capable of figuring a route at all annoying however it tends to prefer expressways regardless of your preferences in a major metro area laced with expressways going in all directions this can create some incredibly convoluted and ridiculous routes creating alternative and more logical routes is possible but tedious the worst part of the tomtom experience is its customer support well perhaps support is the wrong word for it i encountered two problems installing the software it was obviously that the tech support person was clueless and was simply guessing and grasping at straws i had resolved the issues before the rep called and already knew what the problem was the tomtom rep did n't listen kept interrupting and when it was pointed out that he was contradicting the manual he just kept moving the manual in at least one instance was correct and the rep wrong the tomtom packaging itself arrived in broken condition the rep denied it was their packaging claiming that i must have bought a repackaged product talk about insulting i have the package in front of me with the tomtom labels the whole works and this guy is telling me that my lying eyes are deceiving me a fax to tomtom management about my experiences has gone unanswered more than a week later tomtom is riding high right now but i suspect in a couple of years as competitors introduce better products with better support that tomtom will be history it wo n't be the first company that offered a product without support and possesing contempt for its customers to disappear and it wo n't be the last i know that if i find a marginally better product with adequate support i 'd abandon tomtom in a flash jerr ||| 0
the tomtom navigator is a nice enough device until you get to the maps activation the maps activation why should i have to activate my maps if i have paid for the product good question well i activated these maps on one pda and within 2 weeks my pda died and i had to obtain warranty service well i decided that i would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when i got it back from the manufacturers i tend to switch my pda every months anyway so i installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate ok i figure no problem i will be able to activate it 1 2 3 because after all only i have the activation no such luck tomtom wants proof that i have brought a new device what kind of nonsense is that what if i lost my pda in months what if i 'm a nut who likes to change pda 's every months what you mean i have to show you proof that i switched is n't the fact that i have the activation card proof enough i do n't know too many people who pay 269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes avoid them at all costs you will regret your purchase if you change devices frequently one other problem with this product out of the box it is not 100 compatible with windows mobile 5 devices most of the new axims are you really have to break your back to install on these devices avoid ||| 0
i agree this is a flimsy piece of plastic that will not hold the gps unit over a few little bumps i expected more from garmin consider this touratech mount for garmin series its a solid unit it costs a little more but you wo n't be replacing your gps unit due to it falling to the ground ||| 0
my company car has a gps unit and i have gotten to like it i have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around silicon valley enough to get a portable gps unit after some research the garmin ique 3600 is what i ended up with and i paid about 700 the unique feature of this portable gps unit is that a palmpilot comes integrated into the package i use a palmpilot so this gps unit replaces my palmv installation was quite awkward and getting it up and running was a chore i got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now it does do the job fitfully and has several glaring issues most irritating the palm function and the gps function are not seamlessly integrated if an address is entered in the palm part and then route to this address is selected the ique 3600 makes you find the location but the address from the palm section does n't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address i 'm and graffiti has never worked for me all my letters are drawn backward the gps can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go but my unit takes a good minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky this means that i must have a good idea what to do for the first minutes sometimes i just drive randomly until the gps locks in and starts to issue navigation orders also the antenna must be deployed to get any gps reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky this is ok except that the ique 3600 does n't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed the ique 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard if the antenna is not deployed the ique 3600 simply does n't navigate and does n't tell you why worse it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode if i ever figure out what that means ill tell you in a future post i figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of ottawa i 'm a fan of gui design and i must say that the ui here is very very bad not the worse i have ever seen but very bad inconsistent and arbitrary the find has an entirely different function in the gps section from the palm section of course the same icon is used i can not imagine grandma using this thing to navigate what little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious about 10 times more information is needed here it shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose battery savings maybe the secure digital card is too small max of so you ca n't put more than a few california counties in the memory maps storage is managed with a rather hostile gui this is not fatal but is irritating i would rather put a sd card in the ique 3600 and be done with it the ique 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle i do n't find the power issue to be a problem i understand that to get clear bright screens it is necessary to use power i agree with the tradeoff here ||| 0
summary idea very poor implementation good software and easy to use major problem is reception of radio stations i live in a major metropolitan area and have to practically stand on my head to get the radio shark to get clear reception even with a plug in antennae ||| 0
the price on the cases is cheap but you get what you pay for i will never buy these cases again quite a few of them were broke when i got them even the ones that were n't broke are made of very flimsy plastic and i have a feeling they will break if i open them very often they also do n't open and shut very easy look elsewhere for good cases ||| 0

alright before i begin let me just say i know quite a bit about wireless networking i had already connected 2 wireless pc 's to my 128 bit wep encrypted router i had initially set it up as wpa but opted to change it as this hunk of junk does n't support wpa this card will detect your network no problem just try connecting to it apparently i am typing in the wrong wep pass i can assure you i am not perhaps there is an issue between micro oft and i am unaware of go figure i do not have the time nor patience to deal with micro oft 's customer support regarding this issue back to the store this goes do yourself a favour and do not buy this ||| 0
microsoft has never failed to disappoint me i suppose there is something to be said for consistency and this carries on that somewhat dubious tradition i bought this with a the wireless router and both worked fine for a couple weeks however they both conspiratively proceeded to stop functioning this card was the most maddening of the pair because it would find the wireless network every once in a while yet refuse to connect i 've tried every channel and made sure its on infrastructure mode but it still refuses to work i suppose i deserve it though expecting that a microsoft wireless card would connect to a microsoft wireless router with a microsoft operating system do yourself a favor and buy your wireless networking from a decent company that has some expertise in networking like linksys or belkin whatever you do give as little money as possible to this shoddy company ||| 0

i just purchased this printer last night at bestbuy and took it home when i removed the contents of the box i noticed that the usb cord was not in there i read the directions and said that you had to buy the cord separately i could n't believe it so i went to the store and bought one this cost me an additional 11 i went home installed the software and plugged everything in i printed off a few things and it looked great today i went to use the printer again and the power woud n't turn on ! i disconnected then reconnected everything and still no power ! i tried several more things and still could n't turn the power on now i have to return it to bestbuy this was the first and last time i will ever buy anything from hp ! ! ||| 0

i do not recommend sennheiser 's headphones first the good features 1. as with all sennheiser products these earphones deliver first rate sound for its price range 2. the earphones are very comfortable and easy to fit properly using the included pads 3. once inserted in the ear these earphones will not fall out due to vibration movement or sweating however the cord has ugly problems 1. the cord is unusually stiff and consequently tends to be tough to manage this is especially true when the phones are first removed from the package as the cord maintains a sort of corkscrew shape for quite some time 2. the cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone the result is annoying slack around the face and neck 3. the cord is the ugliest possible shade of green all in all should sennheiser offer a new product using the same earphones but with conventional wiring i 'll be a buyer until then i 've given up on using these lime green annoyances ||| 0
i bought this tv for my husband to take hunting but we ca n't get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture the tv is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen i did n't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we do n't have cable i tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other i tried programming with the antenna on the tv and with separate rabbit ears it would only pick up one of the three local network stations it picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which are n't popular i could n't get a good picture on any of the stations and i tried adjusting all the menu items brightness hue etc it did n't even have a good black and white picture it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back sooooo sooo disappointed because i wanted to be able to use this at work too ||| 0
i wanted a keyboard that i could use in low light with both my pc and mac and this one is reasonably those users who enjoy the backlight of a mac powerbook or macbook pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach saitek used to illuminate the keys though on the mac each key has its own embedded light under the key on the saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys but it 's better than nothing and is helpful in low light it would have also been nice if they had an fn key but such is life ||| 0
i purchased my fuji compactflash xd card adapter elsewhere and it does n't work in my hp officejet 7130 it wo n't load in as it 's supposed to but will fit correctly backwards except then i get an amber light that says there is a card error this is supposed to work with my but it does n't for that reason i 'd give it a zero star rating if such a rating existed i 'm going to take this cp version back and hope the more updated cpf version works i 'm a travel writer planning to take my own photos to go with my articles but i 'm getting nowhere fast with this card adapter that refuses to work properly this one is definitely a thumbs down however this is my first dud fuji product i 've bought and i love fuji digital cameras ||| 0

everything your read about the picture quality is true however this product just is n't reliable cost me another 600 to get it fixed and it is n't even 18 months old i am sure i am not alone since you can see these on that famous auction site may with similar power issues customer service from this company is also very poor if i had it to do over i would not have purchased this product and i probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed i think it will be just a matter of time before some of these 5 star reviews begin to change their tune ||| 0
like most have pointed out it 's a digital signal and there 's no need for all the gold plated shielded stuff monster cables hype for analog signals this stuff absolutely makes a difference because analog cables are highly affected by outside em interference some people have pointed out that monster cables are more durable so yes if you plan on swinging around on your cables it might matter if like most people you plug the stuff in behind your equipment then leave it be for months and months do n't waste your money ||| 0

dissapointing the connectors at the back of the selector are not particularly strong so thick or rigid cables under tension twisted at odd angles easily slip out the depth of the connectors is also not great so wires can not be inserted very far to compensate for the lack of traction connections might be better using monster cables ' own angled gold pin connectors but i did n't try those ||| 0
on the good side it was easy to set up and worked reasonably well if the phone tried both cordless and corded was plugged directly into unit however i could not get it to work on other phones in the house when i used the jack to plug it into the wall per the instructions so it would work like a land line on any phone in the house i do not have a land line so it may just need a land line to work since you are supposed to be able to switch back and forth i even tried disconnecting the line outside the house but that did n't work either i experience sporatic dropped calls that were not present before installing this device i contacted tech support and was sent a driver upgrade v 1.20 not available from their website this seemed to improve the dropped call situation a bit but i still have more dropped calls than before the dealbreaker for me was after i found out you had to be logged in as an administrator for it to work with an always on '' internet connection i was not willing to expose myself to that security risk ||| 0

mine actually works and i still hate it i have n't had all the problems others are complaining about run windows xp had no problems compatability strength is fine had no problem installing on one computer that i installed the card before running the cd just like every other card or peripheral i have ever installed i 've never seen one that did n't allow you to install hardware before drivers so i had to take it out run cd and put back in just a minor annoyance that cost 10 minutes but c'mon linksys why the special order most people that are willing to open the computer and install a card do n't need instructions to know take card and put in slot '' and insert disc '' so they do n't look at them at least they put a warning sticker about the installation order on the disk cover for us readers annoying but no stars deducted for this mom to buy one this was before i had installed mine installed easy and it worked fine at first now it connects to router but ca n't find internet yes other computers connect to net through this router just fine would think maybe firewall setting issue but i used to work then just stopped c'mon linksys if your connected to the router how hard it is to find the internet deduct 1 star software only supports hexidecimal passwords of course my router also support standard alphabet and my password had some letters so i had go change network password and update all devices attached to the network c'mon linksys how hard it is to support annoying but no stars deducted slow slow slow to connect ! ! ! ! on my other computers you hit connect and are online in seconds this thing takes 30 seconds to a minute impatient yes but still unacceptable deduct 1 star n't hibernate or sleep computer or card disables only way to get it turned on again is to reboot so it 's either leave computer on all day long or reboot everytime i want go online deduct 1 stars overall bad product deduct one star ||| 0
i bought two of these cards to go alongside my i though that they should work great together since they are from the same manufacturer oh boy was i wrong even the though i get full bars with these cards i get very flaky connections with them i 've tried many different settings and firmwares to try to rectify the problem many hours have been spent trying to get a stable connection no dice very flaky other computers with different cards work fine with the and never dropout so there is something about this card that just is n't right and i ca n't imagine both cards being defective i have n't tested them with another router but if it ca n't work with a then what 's the point ||| 0

these speakers are but do n't expect high sound quality i bought these as refurbs so maybe that is it but when you turn up the volume they do n't sound good i 'd recommend going to a store and testing units before buying new also probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight that is they fade in and out when you walk around the room this should not be a problem on this low bandwidth but it is perhaps the antenna needs a boost ||| 0
too much static with snapping and popping even after making all of the adjustments possible the speakers are only 10 feet away from the transmitter but still sound quality do n't see how these could work 300 feet away i do not recommend this product ||| 0
cheap piece of junk probably has 2 cents of electronic parts in it i 'm returning it to wallmart it might work ok if you live like right next door to the broadcast transmitter otherwise it 's just too weak in its signal pulling ability also when i turn the gain dials they do n't seem like they are really variable i think they are really just switches disguised as variable dials because i do n't see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels i 'm going to now go to a real serious electronics store and look for some serious tv electronics hardware instead of wallmart garbage i 'm going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and i 'm going to try using a variable gain preamp if i can find one a high quality one not junk i tried a preamp from wallmart which was n't adjustable at all and it did help a lot with uhf channels but the vhf channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong so i need a variable gain preamp assuming there is such a thing i would advise everyone to go read the information available on the internet about tv antennas and how to get the best picture with them i did yesterday and there 's a lot of good stuff i never knew before ||| 0
i live in a particularly bad spot for tv reception and have been forced to use cable this antenna brings in several local stations but the quality of the picture is unsatisfactory so unfortunately for me it 's either back to cable or try an amplified outside antenna miles kenned ||| 0
yeah they claim this thing works with ms powerpoint but what they do not tell you is that it only works with part of powerpoint it only works in slide mode it does not work in presentation view mode of course most of my presentations are run in presentation view mode so the remote is useless and they have no fix for it they can not even document that this is the case i am going to look for something else maybe the microsoft remote it 's true this presenter has problems with powerpoint 's presenter view because in that mode pgup and pgdown keys are used to scroll the notes however here 's a neat trick i discovered that makes it work again start the presentation in presenter view pres b '' on your keyboard to show a blank screen click the mouse anywhere in the blank screen once to resume the presentation and then again to advance to the next slide magically from this point on the presenter buttons work flawlessly ||| 0
i wish the description had beem better somethimg like this phone needs another unit to work ! people who have never seen an expansion phone can be missled like i was returned item ||| 0

all i wanted was something to make the incoming audio louder while listening to a call and typing during an interview i could n't find just a headset amp so i purchased this system '' based on plantronics ' good name instead of just plugging it into the wall phone jack you have to use a regular phone route the cord to this then back out to the again which makes this light unit basically hamstrung between the headset and handset and does n't want to sit on the desk without taping it down then you have to take the off the hook place it on the desk assuming you have desk space which i do n't then push a button to start up the headset most importantly listening sound quality was muffled and not very loud if i turned up the incoming sound volume it immediately put a loud annoying squeal of feedback into the microphone making it totally unusable i went back to my regular unampflied plantronics headset which just plugs into the wall phone and is always on with no extra cords ac adapter or buttons to push i 'm not very thrilled with that but for 15 it sounds much better and much louder without the feedback or the hassles so for now i guess i 'll stick with that until i find something else that just improves the incoming sound ||| 0
i never even got a chance to listen to music through these headphones i could n't get them to stay my ears the loops that go around your ear are huge and just make them more cumbersome these may fit men with bigger ears better but i would n't recommend them for females ||| 0
i like the color and sony 's technology of the earphone itself but the hanger that should be placed on your ear is worthless when i put the earphone in the ears the hanger part is just hanging in the air not supporting the earphone to be placed in and steady because of that the earphones easily pop out of your ear ||| 0
the device is well built but has one major flaw the adhesive comes in 2 types removable '' and permanent '' types neither adhesive would stick to the dash of my jeep liberty i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do with it now it appears as though i 'm going to either have to find a more permanent mounting solution or find another type of adhesive ||| 0
after two weeks of use i returned the mouse because 3 out of 4 times i tried to make a right click it would not work i eventually got frustrated and decided to return it i 'm sure it has to do with the way i use the mouse but i 'm not planning on changing my angle or whatever it is that makes it fail i think a regular 2 button mouse is just perfect i wish this mouse had a real mechanical right button because it would be perfect i loved the scroll wheel and will miss it greatly ||| 0

my friend bought one and i tried to set it up for him let me tell you this thing is pure garbage i spent a good hour and a half trying to get it to work i tried to set it up using 2 laptops which were set up exactly how the booklet outlined the direct ethernet connection would n't work and connecting to it through wireless was spotty at best i could sometimes get into the setup page through wireless but all of a sudden the setup page would stop working stay away from ! all their products are cheaply made and difficult to configure ||| 0
i got this print server about a month back initially it took me 4 hours to get this thing installed and running in the wireless mode ! after i got it setup it worked fine for a week but then the wireless connection with the print server got flaky so i switched to the wired mode all was well again but then after a couple of weeks the wired connection got flaky it stopped printing and did n't recognize my after fiddling around with it for a few hours i finally got the contraption working again but now my latest problem is that the print server prints garbage to the printer ! plugging the printer directly in to a computer works fine but the print service somehow corrupts the data going to the printer and i end up with pages of garbage and error messages summary this thing was a beast to and every time something goes wrong it takes a phenomenal amount of time to debug and correct that 's in addition to the questionable reliability of this device i say steer clear of this thing i 'm now shopping for something better and never buying again ||| 0
this thing does a horrible job at detecting wifi networks i have to be within 10 feet of my router to get a 50 signal even though i can walk out tot he edge of my house and easily still get a good connection if it does detect bluetooth which half the time it does n't regardless of it being active it cancels out the wifi detection so if you have a bluetooth headset and you 're talking the thing will just let you know that yes there is a bluetooth device around thanks i was wondering ||| 0
my husband bought me this for christmas because we were moving to a new city he picked it out because unlike garmin and magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road the features are easy to use the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic it really comes up with a great plan however my first one lasted 3 months before it died i then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well i was very reluctant to buy a different brand but had to for dependability i still do n't like my garmin as much but at least it works come on tomtom get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions ||| 0
i 'm a longtime user of wacom intuos tablets and i was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual there were no wireless intuos products available at the time of purchase so i went with the graphire bluetooth unfortunately the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use i plan on returning it the major problem lies with the pen both in design and responsiveness design the graphire series is cheaper than the intuos and there 's a good reason why the graphire pen is thinner lighter and has no grip if you have very small hands this might be acceptable in my hand this feels like a toothpick it 's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it does n't feel like it has any durability additionally the graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever i put the pen back into it responsiveness there is a delay whenever using the pen to click in any options opening windows selecting files etc second may sound acceptable but if you like me use the pen for everything not just drawing believe me it is utterly maddening on the other hand the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all so i know it 's the pen and not my computer the tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine but the bottom line is that it 's more important for me to have a responsive durable pen than a wireless tablet if you 've never used an intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies but for those who have this is like going from a mercedes to a honda civic you 'll get better gas mileage with the civic but the benz gives you the best overall driving experience i need the driving experience so i 'm going back to the intuos wire and all ||| 0
i know that everyone else seems to love this so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini pink is a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge and my current playing time per charge no changing settings not backlighting nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies is about 2 hours apple will gladly sell me a new 70 battery but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products i 'm not saying do n't buy it there are n't realistically any better choices out there than the ipod but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me i think i 'm going to dig out my old discman ||| 0
i returned this thing the day after i bought it i should of been clued in when i purchased it at the store all the transpod models had a little sticker on them advising them about the store 's return policy i thought it a little unusual at the time but after listening to the thing i understand why now i 'm sure a lot of people had been returning this model the sound quality was really bad you have to turn your stereo way up to hear the music and even then it sounds almost as bad as am radio i 'll add that the files i was playing were aac encoded files so they 're decent quality too ||| 0
after only a couple of months of light use the sub woofer started making loud thumping sounds and the system stoped working as soon as power is connected to the sub woofer the loud thumping starts i exchanged the system and the second set had the same problem after 6 weeks ! ! a total piece of junk ||| 0
while a nice product packed with great features when it works the bottom line is that it does not support twain drivers meaning you can not scan through any application other than scansnap big minus second minus is jams jams jams i have barely used this machine but the double feeds are incredible the rollers are new and the machine is clean i even tried using high grade color laser copier paper but still double feeds big time ! upon occasion i get a good feed and i am so thankful for that if you are planning to do some serious office organizing with various types of paper sizes and paper weights skip this product and go for a adf flatbed scanner this baby will jam up your day and consume all of your time with fiddling reorganizing the misfeeds and clearing jams think deeply before buying this one also with an adf flatbed you can scan books and unusual documents thin paper very heavy paper that an adf and the scansnap wo n't process by simply lifting the lid of the adf and taking the scan directly on the glass with scansnap you are screwed ||| 0
just plugged it in and i 'm ready to ship it back creates an annoying high pitched buzz ||| 0
i was hoping that by getting this i 'd get a decent flow of air and i 'd be able to use it anywayer but i was sorely dissappointed it does n't give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel plus its too loud to use in most places if you really need it you can get it but i ca n't use mine often because like i said its too loud not worth it not enough air flowing ||| 0
the battery life for this phone after one short year is abysmal after charging it all night it dies after a few hours of nonuse the redial button simply has never worked it is not user friendly at all although i could live with this if the two issues above were resolved i contacted at t and requested that they send me a new model that works since this phone is obviously defective if they refuse then i wo n't ever buy an at t product again and neither will anyone i come into contact with it 's that simple update at t refused to do anything about the phone despite the obvious flaws as a result i will never buy another at t product again at t you are exhibiting the traits of a company that will go out of business ||| 0
we bought a set of these phones because they looked nice and because at t is a reliable company but these phones are the worst after having them for about 3 weeks we began having terrible results with the in the phones i took them back and got a new set these lasted about twice as long before the battery life just became worthless we are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time say 1 hour and you ca n't talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again and yes we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge and all that kind of stuff still i have never used a more frustrating phone nor will i ever purchase an at t phone again i bought a new phone today and once fully charged i will take these at t phones out back and smash them with a hammer ||| 0
i have to agree with many others about the poor quality of this phone the battery life decreased rapidly and after several weeks i was forced to keeps both phones on their chargers instead of gambling on replacement cells i bought a panasonic phone as suggested by other disappointed at t model 2255 buyers ||| 0
i also was suckered in by the monster name i have an older sony adapter that i 've used in the past with no problems but could n't locate it right before a so i bought this one also this actually sounds substantially worse than my actual cassettes even though they 're all over 10 years old the sound is very poor ratio stay well away ||| 0
i attempted to use this product in my 2002 chevy tahoe factory audio system as others here noted the deck would quickly error and eject the monster adapter the monster adapter did work in my 2000 harley davidson fltri factory audio system the difference is that the harley unit does not have '' detection the tahoe does i returned this monster unit and picked up the sony sony the sony device is a bit different as it has small link of simulated audio tape within the tape path this little bit of simulated audio tape effectively fools the tape unit not to think that there is an error and eject the cassette adapter there are other reasons that these adapters will google is your friend but the sony unit seemed to be the solution for me the big reason for the zero star review is that monster has zero information on their web site or product packaging regarding device compatibility or troubleshooting ||| 0
i lost my adapter that came from walmart and was a generic brand it worked perfect this thing was expensive and it did n't work at all i 'd have to turn the volume on both the ipod and stereo all the way up and then i 'd get some sign of life not anything you 'd want to listen to it 's worst than even the worst rf transmitter i 've ever tried do n't waste your money believe the reviews ||| 0
i bought this unit a couple of years ago based on its features but soon discovered that it ca n't normally do the one thing that all gpss should tell you where you are i used my vista for about a year and half and would estimate that i spent 10 to 15 of the time staring at some type of lost signal message the unit is totally useless under any type of tree cover and often has trouble holding a signal anywhere on overcast days which means about half the time in the seattle area where i live i would not recommend this unit to anyone but my worst enemy ||| 0
i had this gps device for only 3 days and found it to be no better than mediocre although at one point i was able to track 6 waas satellites and the display claimed accuracy to 17 feet while driving along a straight road for 5.5 miles it indicated that i was traveling approximately 350 feet to the side of the road on two occasions on this straight road it said i actually crossed the road and traveled on the opposite side i conducted a test by placing the unit where it would have an unobstructed view of the sky for 1 hour and leave it motionless the trip computer reported that it had moved nearly a during that hour i checked the accuracy at intervals and it was constantly reporting accuracy between feet the base maps are crude and inaccurate a major road hwy 7 in tacoma wa stops at street really ! if i drive down hwy 7 it goes a couple of miles farther than the unit shows while using the compass you must hold the unit level in order to obtain accurate readings understandable there is even a little message that tells you to hold it level if you are off a little nice i tried and tried to find level '' according to the unit and after about 3 or 4 minutes was able to determine where level '' was it was nowhere close to actual level now if i am trying to navigate with the unit 's compass while it is mounted to my bike there is no way it is going to be level and accurate at 5.3 ounces it does n't even pass off as a good paperweight fortunately i was able to return it to the seller with no problems for a full refund thank you rei ! i found out that sells the unit for 50 bucks less than rei after i bought it though recommendation if you need a paperweight get a rock if you need a gps get a different one ||| 0
garmin 's devices are pretty good somewhat tempermental but mostly reliable it 's connecting their software and dealing with garmin support that is a nightmare and you will need to call them because their software has all kinds of bugs and an archaic key system customer service hold time minues response time for email tech requests a staggering working days clearly garmin does not care about its customers ||| 0
when these headphones are working they are great i never have trouble receiving sound they are amazingly comfortable great battery life and batteries are rechargeable long distance is great too i can walk throughout the whole house on multiple floors without any trouble but it 's far to often that these are not working as a matter of fact i 've gone through four pair in the last 2 years the first pair did n't work out of the box the second pair lasted two weeks and then the headset just would not turn on the third pair lasted about eight months before the same thing happened they just would not turn on the forth pair lasted about a year and then yesterday the very same thing happened ||| 0
after having an experience with slow startup speeds and actually freezing a computer with the cruzer micro with i feel compelled to write this negative review the mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives a fast and higlhly compatible interface any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability i work at an educational institution wher i am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive as a matter of policy we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background ||| 0
i bought the cruzer micro not knowing that it came with the launch pad software preloaded as soon as i tried to use it on my computer at work the company 's decided it was an intruder preventing it from working at all i was ticked i had almost given up on it and was actually shopping around for another usb drive that had no software on it when i ran into a website that lets you download an uninstaller for the launch pad i downloaded it ran it and it took no more than 15 seconds to clean out the offending garbage ! now i like my micro cruzer all over again ! oh yeah the website to uninstall yours at is ||| 0
i wish i had read the reviews before buying this piece of junk as another reviewer says ruins it i have a mac so that feature is useless but even worse it can not be disabled everytime i plug in the drive i get this cheesy cd image cluttering up my desktop and i have to eject it along with the drive icon before the unit can be removed what clunky engineering i 'll be returning this and scratching sandisk off my list of reliable companies i also agree with the reviewer who complained about the packaging it is impossible to open without tearing it apart which is probably a strategy to reduce returns ||| 0
spare sd card slots molded into the lid of this case prevent it from closing completely around the tungsten you will see a noticeable gap around the bottom edge of the closed case slight pressure on the latch side side will cause the case to pop open unexpectedly in purse or brief case i returned mine to amazon a few days after receipt still looking for an alternative ||| 0
with a destructive toddler in the house i like to back up my dvd movies having recently purchased a 25 unit spindle i recently tried backing up several dvds with my sony dvd recorder although the recording process initially did seem to work smoothly when i attemped to play back the disks recorded at speed i would have read errors and lockups on dvd players usually towards the end of the film the outside of the physical disk where maximum recording speed is obtained i did have better reliability recording at speed and suspect that writes will work fine as well given the fact that i paid a premium for this new high speed media i am disappointed i have had nearly 100 reliability with memorex recently making 25 successful recordings in a row with this brand asin ||| 0
i bought this thing becuase i use voice recognition with my computer and i 'm on the phone quite a bit it was supposed to eliminate the need to for two head sets with the amplifier and the plantronics headset to go with it the total cost came to around 200 yay ! the amplifier has a strong hum when used through the phone and when i use it witht eh computer it has such poor sound quality that it does n't work with my voice rec software i called customer service and they said i should send the unit to them and they would send me a new one funny i have read that in a few places online i went out and bought the labtec equivelent the at a whopping 15 headset included the head set is cheap though and it is chrystal clear for both the phone and my computer plus if you want to upgrade the head set you can buy any analog computer headset save yourself 185 and just buy the you will be happy ||| 0

we needed to know if this unit philips dvd was compatible with disks so i googled it and found this amazon listing we were totally amazed to find the reviews we found and wish we had done this years ago instead of spending all this time struggling with this poor excuse of a dvd player we have spent countless hours clean'ing and skipdr'ing disks just to get them to play and sometimes even that did n't work just in case anyone else comes along take the excellent advice given several times in this collection of reviews run the other direction without question if someone offers you this dvd player now we do not believe this is a fundamental problem with philips we have and have had many fine products sold by philips we are guessing this particular dvd player was the result of some very poor product planning that went very badly before during and after the fact hopefully the person s responsible has have per usual corporate practice been promoted farther up the ladder where they can no longer inflict this kind of pain on customers we tried to give this product 0 '' stars but amazon requires at least 1 '' star probably a quid pro quo agreement of some sort we imagine ||| 0
unfortunately my wife and i purchased this product '' without reading the posted reviews here all are entirely accurate ! i can not calculate how many hours i have spent trying to figure out what is wrong no loading skipping freezing not opening when it freezes all down the line combined with 100 trips to and from the video stores to exchange their defective '' dvds my wife was firmly of the belief the dvds were just dirty '' but i finally decided this agrees with one of the reviewers there is a balance problem in the drawer when there is a the drawer sometimes not always fixes it but only until the next time and will not stop the freezing problems if my wife had a dime for every time i said this thing is a piece of ! '' she would be a millionaire this is very late but if this product is still on the market in any form stay many miles away and philips ' arrogant lack of response as reported i have no personal experience here is virtually criminal in this day and age ||| 0
for some years i tried this and other monster products to the tune of over 1000 in monster gear the more you learn about video and audio the more you 'll avoid anything with the monster label specifically this meets no ntsc dvd or ieee standard it is common hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding has a sharp image but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from skin tones to color blotching dirty grays burned highlights murky shadows noisy reds and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds makes video test patterns look great but who watches test patterns all day amazon offers many other brands at good prices why waste your on this stuff i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar belden viewsonics and others from amazon result vast improvement in every respect ||| 0
bought the cable and put it between my pioneer dvd player and sony wega tv i was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality color sharpness same as the result as i used the composite cable came with the box i really do n't know why i have to say my tv is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even i do n't use dvd player unfortunately my dvd player does not have component jack to let me try the next level experience i do n't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one i was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance we just do n't have a benchmark to evaluate it ||| 0
i bought these headphones based on the first couple of reviews i read here i should have read further because about two weeks after i purchased the earphones the left side went out completely there was nothing obvious on the outside of the unit and i did n't hear any rattling '' as described by other users the darn things just quit ! i must say however that the sound quality for those first two weeks was excellent but all in all not worth the money and frustration ||| 0

i purchased this for my intel imac mainly because i was so frustrated with the mighty mouse i wanted something with two separate buttons i had tried the logitech mx 610 which i purchased as well for another computer and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful so i purchased this desktop set because i wanted it to match my mac and so i could have a proper 2 button mouse i figured the mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well in fact i thought i would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a mac and had extra shortcut buttons other than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse this combo has been an utter disappointment first of all the white does n't quite match it 's close but just a touch too cream also there 's just too much silver especially on the mouse secondly it does n't have all the buttons the mighty mouse does there is no button to switch to the widgets luckily you can press on the keyboard not quite as convenient but still possible however i have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs this is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open thirdly this mouse just does n't work as well as other logitechs it is too light lacking the feel '' and a bit of the comforting weight that the mx 610 has when you move it around also the speed of the cursor is off no matter how i try to adjust the speed it does n't quite match the speed of the original mighty mouse it is either too fast or too slow i think part of it is simply osx 's lack of adjustability compared to gasp windows for cursor speed finally the keyboard is simply atrocious i do n't even use it anymore it 's packed up in the box and i plugged the original mac keyboard back in the keys make a horrendous clatter when typing the pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal also the depth is quite shallow this is a desktop keyboard you can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards i 've tried also the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform the raised dots to help you find the f or j buttons is too shallow i ca n't find the asdf an jkl rows by touch i have to look as a touch typist this is an unforgiveable sin it basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it i 'm typing on a thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this logitech so in short save your money and avoid this combo i rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons unlike the mighty mouse which is why i purchased this in the first place it hit my most basic requirement otherwise it really deserves a 1 star rating ||| 0
love this phone only the caller id would work ! it worked fine on day 1 day 2 worked on and off 3 caller id not working tried moving the phone to different outlets removing the batteries putting them back in tried new wire etc the phone works great otherwise loved the caller id when it was working much larger than most and easy to read oh well ||| 0
after having my old phone for 40 years i bought a new nwb phone due to remodeling it lasted 5 months you can not get through on their help line and they do not answer their buy a nwb phone at your own risk i had to buy another phone at t and it works fine ||| 0
i am comparing these transfers to the hp transfers for colored shirts these require a reverse image and are just not user friendly after three unsuccessful attempts i just went back to the more expensive hp 's the transfers did not adhere well and would flake off in little chunks even before you tried to wash them ||| 0
these sound awful i 'm embarrassed to admit i spent 140.00 on these the earphones from my 1989 sony walkman are far superior if you like your music to sound as if it came from the bottom of a well then these are for you ||| 0
bought these pretty cheap from the good great sound quality all digital transmission so no hissing look good decent battery life the bad needs drivers most usb headsets granted not wireless do n't does n't work on the mac if you are not playing music they beep every 15 seconds or so then after a couple of minutes they turn themselves off this drove me crazy and was not configurable takes you seconds every time you turn them on and try to pair them not terribly comfortable after about a month of normal use the headset cracked in the middle and stopped working bad quality o material the logitech people said they will refund whatever i paid for after i send them a copy of the receipt and the broken product too bad i get to pay for shipping and i 'm not even sure they 'll refund the original shipping lesson learned ||| 0
the toshiba vcr combo arrived and was quite light in weight it hooked up ok but the orange nice color display constantly stayed on zeros and the vcr played tapes so bad there was always a white static streak across the screen bottom i sent it back after trying a few tapes all tested poor better to get a good vcr for good vhs picture display quality ||| 0
i bought this unit because a dlink sales rep said it would be perfect for my application hah ! it does n't work at all i hope amazon will let me return it the first thing i had to do was upgrade the firmware no instructions on how to do this but for the uninitiated you have to download the file from dlink move it to the dlink firmware folder on your computer then get the ap manager to see your unit that 's another story involving ip addresses again no help from the install documents and then you can install the update i finally got the to see my network but never could get it to talk back it just sent gibberish the net tech and i worked on it for most of two working days to no avail spent a lot of time on the phone with the dlink tech staff too where everyone involved said we got some bad dope from the sales staff but that we might get it to work provided it is compatible with the existing equipment blah blah blah my assessment of dlink and the dlink poor support poor support confusing tech support and poor instruction for a product that may be but then again may not be compatible with your existing equipment what 's up dlink ||| 0
when i got the moniter i said it was cool and alright but whe i plugged it in it did nat work and i was tried again but it did not work so i tried to send it back but it was to much of a decided t see what was the problem and send it to a electronics store and the told me the the ic was only thing i could have done is to buy a new i paid 800 trinidadian dollars to get it to was furious ||| 0
my family and i just relocated 3 states away from our extended family and wanted to get a good webcam to keep intouch with everyone and let our 2 year old see his grandmother once and a while when i saw the microsoft lifecam at target stores and that it was compatible with windows live i thought it would be worth the 100 price tag to be able to keep in touch with family i purchased the software and started the installation process on my computer just so you know my system is running a pentium 4 processor and has 8 active usb 2.0 connections only 3 of which are being used for the keyboard mouse and this webcam along with of ram which is more than necessary for this product to function the software took about 10 minutes to install which i thought was a little odd then it askes for you to plug in the camera my xp system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly i uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result i then tried a different usb port just in case there was a problem following a stepwise process i checked and updated all drivers for the usb hub ports etc and i checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly i then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice by now i was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera i went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic but it said that there was no camera attached i again tried to find the camera through other means with no results for the price paid and the hours i spent trying to install the hardware i can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it i will be returning it to target for a full refund and will look into investing my money with another brand as someone else said earlier in the reviews does microsoft ever send their products through quality assurance before they release them ||| 0
dont microsoft ever send their software thru quality assurance checking they asked me to install a windows update kb something or the other saying that it prevented the software from running at 100 cpu usage lo and behold it still gets stuck ! ! task manager dutifully reports that it is after all consuming all resources ||| 0
i 've found these headphones to be highly overrated the noise cancelling is primarily from the snug fit in the ear when the noise circuit is turned on the background hiss '' becomes incredibly annoying to be fair though this model does remove some background low frequency sound even in addition to the the noise reduction from the ear plugs the frequency response during playback sounds like an old am radio ||| 0
in terms of sound quality noise cancelling and general comfort thise headphones are top of the line i absolutely love the way the sound and the ammount of noise cancelling that they provide i used them regularly when mowing the lawn and when flying and i always recieved the highest quality sound and noise cancelleation i was even able to listen to while mowing the lawn and hear all of the appropriate frequencies on the low end however inside of 6 months i have gone through 2 pairs of these headphones because the right ear headphone has gone out on them the worst part is i ca n't even begin to imagine why it goes out i keep my heaphones in a locked cabinet in my office every night last friday i placed back into the nice little carry bag that they come with and placed them into this cabinet this morning when i pulled them out for use the right ear bud is out again no physical damage is apparent anywhere on the headphones and there is not a broken wire anywhere in fact the wiring is perfectly fine and still functional it is the physical earbud the hard plastic peice that has gone out if i squeeze the earbud hard enough it will turn on again something inside of the earbud is obviously designed improperly and i would highly recommend that noone purchase these headphones because of this ||| 0
someone previously pointed out that these earphones did not filter out the highs well it may be the highs all i know is the only thing it seems to filter well is my wife and kids voices and allow in every other ambiant noise around now i may have gotten a lemon but the sound is poor volume cranked to high on any device i put this on comes out low at best put in any other set of earphones and it is painfully loud the little inline triangle that has the switch is cumbersome and is at a strange distance from the earphones just seems to far from the earphones or not far enough just does n't seem to clip naturally anywhere either to much cord or not enough i am not a music or sound expert by any means so it does not bode well that i think these earphones are poor at best ||| 0
i got avaya roadwarrior up and running on my computer to use when i work remotely my told me to get a gn netcom headset but i figured i 'd save some money and get this one big mistake there is a major problem with some laptops when the power cord is plugged in the listener on the other end has what sounds like you in a an airplane during flight the humming goes away when you unplug the power cord but that does n't help me i need to be able to use it when the power cord is plugged in or not anyway i chatted with plantronics support and then informed me that it 's a known issue with no work around except to unplug the power cord while using it so it 's getting returned ||| 0
it failed dragon naturally speaking 's sound tests tests easily passed by the cheapo mike included with the program and just try to return it antonline stonewalls plantronics does n't respond at all ||| 0
gave it one star because there was no option for zero died after two days of use would not turn on or reset previous zen nano same thing after six months of use i guess that would be my last creative product ||| 0
the first warning sign is that the drivers are not windows approved and unsigned their installation instructions advise you to ignore the warnings next is the cheesy cool '' looking program please forget about the groovy graphics and just provide a usable interface then the drivers do n't work my cursor slides all around the screen after i stop moving the mouse i tried calling customer support but there is no telephone support i then tried connecting with their online chat support no one helped me after 20 minutes two days later in response to an they sent me 3 pages of instructions about how to adjust my system to accommodate their crappy software too bad because the mouse itself is a nice piece of hardware and comfortable i 'm sending mine back for a refund ||| 0
the router card does not work my old one works with the new router but the new card does not work at all so i need a refund for it or a replacement thanks ||| 0
i bought it with my linksys broadband router with speedbooster the software installation procedure is really poor when i ran the software first few times it constantly gave me error messages ca n't remember what they were so i had to reinstall it time till it settled down finally then i set up the network settings with my router and scanned for the access point infrastructure but it could n't find anything even though the router was only feet away ! at one point it managed to connect to the router but it was still searching for the internet after several minutes it could n't find anything and disconnected from the router i knew there was nothing wrong the router or internet because i inserted my old belkin adapter and it connected straight away ! do n't waste your money on this if you wan na get a router get the one i 've got which is quite good if you want a wifi adapter then get belkin wireless notebook adapter i could n't find any adapters by them but this one is really good http ||| 0
this product keeps changing home addresses none of which are the address i typed in the initial field it does not stay charged so that it is actually able to function as advertised if you are gone from home any length of time and you put your dog in a yard additionally gravity takes it down to the lower neck area in common use so that when the dog is doing normal dog things the device sinks downward so that the antenna is pointing toward the ground the pictures are misleading we tried all of the advise the company gave us it 's just not a device that works when and where you need it to work it was a lot to invest to have this many problems ||| 0
it 's called a leash or a fence how about keeping your pet safe the responsible not to mention cheap way i 've been a volunteer at a animal shelter for 5 years and i 'm still amazed at the lack of guardianship people show for their pets so your dog has this doodad on its neck it 's not going to keep it from running out into the street and getting hit by a car or picked up by somebody who wants to use it for bait or sell it to a lab yes these things happen often have some sense people this is ridiculous ||| 0
a nice device but microsoft did n't include software that encrypts the fingerprint image although very difficult to do someone steal your fingerprint to be safe i would not use this fingerprint reader for password protected websites that contain sensitive information or for network admin or computer bios privledges ||| 0
this camera had some nice features like the ability to write to a network storage device smart motion detection etc the recorded videos have their own codec so you can use it or some videos are unreadable and if you dig deep enough has a utility to make them readable i upgraded the latest firmware 1.06 tried using the ability to write to a storage device and found it very hard to manage motion triggering is touchy but works once you set it up the wireless caused 90 of my communication problems ran a wire and things were fine clock could not keep time for anything set usa edt and it was fine and shortly after it feel back one hour knows of this and the only solution was to use atlantic time it has all the right features and image is great but i have to vote thumbs down on this unit one more thing hard codes an ip address so if you try and factory reset remotely or of you happen to be using a different network addressing scheme you 're done why for the life of me they do n't use dhcp by default is beyond me ||| 0
camera will not stay up on wireless network with dlink router ! firmware has some serious issues dlink support was worthless i returned the camera and bought a panasonic and never looked back ||| 0

i have several pairs of portable speakers for my laptop but forgot to bring them on a recent trip and bought these based on the glowing reviews posted here however when i received the speakers i found that they are much larger in size and much lower in both quality of build and quality of sound than for example the creative speakers they have a huge and unstable footprint when opened about 9 inches long and one inch deep and are not particularly compact when folded either the sound is not rich and they eat batteries amazingly fast then begin to buzz i do not recommend these speakers ||| 0
i bought this for my ipod i drive a late model subaru with the lighter switch inside of the ashtray console firstly the transmitter was completely dangerous to operate while driving its impossible to use in park and neutral in my car the controls are bulky the transmission cut out in mountains on hills and on the highway whenever i drove over resulting in my ipod starting and stopping because it shakes and wobbles in the console in short it hardly worked and i was afraid to touch it while driving lest i 'd knock my gear shift out of place its cheaply made and all in all a complete piece of junk this is hands down the worst ipod fm transmitter i have ever used i 've previously used a basic kensington all in one model stolen by wife worked well but awkward and ended up replacing this with a far superior griffin road trip i reccommend spending the extra 15 on the road trip ||| 0
worked well for a while 2 weeks the sound always had static later the sound went really low and then it just died ||| 0
i have the same problem some other reviewers had the audio was extremely low unless i manually adjust the cassette it 's not that easy you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts but that does n't always work if that does n't work you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit i 'd rather not have an accident on the highway by either 1 fiddling with the audio or 2 smashing the adapter into little pieces while i drive hundreds of songs on the ipod and no way to listen while you drive ||| 0

i had from the same product line it craped out after 9 months and now i am on the fifth call to try to resolve the issue and get it shipped back i do n't know where their support is located but the line quality is very bad they ran the same drill over and over but just do n't want to issue you an order for you to ship back this is the first product i own and probably the last the resolution looks crappy even when it 's new and now it 's totally dead even reset wo n't work on it ||| 0
yesterday was the annual thanksgiving sale day i got this cf card from staples by 40 after easy rebate with this price i think it is a great deal however it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was dead all my photos in the card were lost i am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering i know how to recover data if a hard drive fails but this time i find i simply ca n't help fortunately staples have a good return policy and i just returned it without hassle hopefully this is only my case my suggestion make sure your dealer has a good return policy before you get this item ||| 0
of course as all things computer related as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically unit works great but buy the 2 gig more bang for the ||| 0

i bought this reader for my laptop since it did n't have usb but to tell you the truth i think this device is a little slower than usb 1.0 ! i am going to buy the lexar card and see if that improves the download speed because this reader is so slow it took me about to download of photos from my extreme iii card that is unacceptable ||| 0
note i am fully aware that compact flash cards have a maximum sustained upload speed which caps off the potential speed of the medium it is being transferred on i purchased this product to use in conjunction with my sandisk ultra ii compact flash cards i thought that pc cards would be faster than usb 1.1 and 2.0 but thats not the truth whenever i try to upload files from my cf cards thru the pc card it slows down the entire system i ca n't do other tasks while the card is uploading files since everything is acting sparatic and slow i 'll admit the card is a bit faster in uploading files than usb 1.1 but i ca n't do anything else on my computer while the card is working honestly i would rather have a little bit slower performance with my usb 1.1 card reader and be able to work on my computer at the same time instead of having the card slow down my entire system i believe this card is a pcmcia card i 've heard good praise for lexar 's pcmcia cards but i have yet to try it out i 'm sure it costs more money than this pc card or a usb card reader though all in all i suggest getting a usb 2.0 compact flash reader over this product if you want to work on your computer at the same time as you are uploading files otherwise if your the kinda person who doesnt mind leaving the computer alone while the files are uploaded to your computer this will work just fine for you ||| 0
and the worst part is that i 'm actually glad about it ! i bought this set to replace a logitech wireless combo that was about 3 years old when the mouse scroll wheel stopped working i figured i 'd treat myself to what looked like the best wireless set out there here 's what i found 1 the keyboard is huge i have dell 19 '' flat panel and the keyboard looks ridiculous in front of it 2 even though the usb dongle is plugged in the dell monitor about 1 foot from the it still loses its connection and i get the message usb device has malfunctioned '' i have to remove and replace the dongle and it starts again this happens a couple of times a week but of course at the most inconvenient times 3 the keyboard goes to sleep like the mouse after a few minutes to save battery life the mouse will wake up after a slight delay and i 'm used to that but i ca n't tell you how many times i pressed '' to copy something into the buffer and then discovered that it did n't take '' because the keyboard was asleep the keyboard should never go to sleep or this feature '' should have a way to be disabled ! 4 the keyboard died stopped responding at less than 6 months old i still use the mouse but dug out an ancient dell quietkey wired keyboard frankly i do n't miss the behemoth ms monster at all at least the old keyboard does n't take up the whole desk and when i hit it works every time microsoft has made some good keyboards and mice but this set is not one of them buyer beware ||| 0
i bought this set hoping to consolidate most of my wireless devices onto a single hub and standard setting up the set was easy enough in windows but i immediately found that the mouse did not work well at all the cursor would move in increments of around 10 pixels at a time i even put the bluetooth adapter on a usb extension cord and placed it within inches of the mouse but that did n't help at all the keyboard seemed to work well but i did n't use it for very long because the mouse was unbearable to use i have several wireless networks in my area which may be causing interference with the bluetooh though ||| 0
speaking from real experience do n't waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price i bought a few top of the line monster cables once i got the top of the line sony hdtv later on i switched cables around with other brand cheaper component cables such as philips the hdmi standard owner by the way and also other hdmi cables even no name brands coming with my dvd player you know what i see absolutely no difference even under close examination the sony produces the finest pitch you can find on any tv you think about what that means stop buying this ridiculously priced cables and save your and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list digital is digital do n't let monster mislead you that their cables produce more 11010 than others ||| 0

i purchased the kensington after my casette adapter developed an annoying wheel noise i heard and read a lot about the problems with fm transmitters like static and audio quality but the kensington was the best rated unit it arrived the day before i had to take a business trip and thought it would be a great test the first day i used it it seemed to work great the next day on my return trip home all i got was static and could barely hear the music from my ipod i tried every station i could find with little or no transmission on it but the audio quality remained extremely poor i am not sure if there are just too many stations broadcasting in the nyc metro area or this particular unit is defective but since my car has a casette player i will go with casette adapter for now if you have lots of unused frequencies it might work in your area just be sure you can return it if it does n't work out for you ||| 0
i had a monster icarplay for some time and had givben it to a friend so when i was looking for a new one i thought i 'd try the kensington big mistake my car could n't pick the signal up without manually tuning very painful go for the monster products over this in a heartbeat ||| 0
using this in my wife 's expedition is very annoying for some reason the cord must be placed in exactly the right position or static will drown out the music coming from the car 's speakers note that no other electrical devices in this car and there are a lot of them she got every option available with the car misbehave at all i would not repeat this purchase not can i recommend anyone else buy one of these i only gave it two stars because with continual minor effort it can be made to work acceptably however fiddling with the cord while driving is certainly not a safe practice ||| 0
new are notorious thieves in the consumer electronics repair industry i personally submitted for repair both a video camera sony and a car cd player a sony a top of the line unit if you 've heard of it you know what i 'm talking about i was told that the warranty did not cover what was wrong with my video camera some ambiguous statement about logic board power unit etc failure followed and would have to pay 780 to have it fixed i naturally refused and was forced to keep my dead 4 handycam an unfortunate testament to some of sony 's now widely publicized qc issues the reason i did not send in the camera initially has to do with the fiasco involving my cd player i was told explicitly that if new could not fix it they would either return the unit or write me a check in the amount of not even enough to cover the cost of the player as an added insult when they indeed could not fix the unit they kept it and i never received a check ! ! ! simply outrageous ! blatant theft and i 'm not the only one who will tell you a story about new and such an act they are impossible to get ahold of and literally take your money and do n't expect to ever hear from them should your camera stop working and good luck getting ahold of them if you happen to send it in beforehand chances are you will have to eat the loss as i did this product deserves a negative star and should come with an automatic refund i seriously thought it was a gag when i saw new was in charge of the coverage what a joke ! whoever runs your company new ought to be both ashamed of themselves and held liable for all the countless damages and losses they have caused the whole lot of you belong in an unfriendly prison ||| 0
i originally placed my order with my a digital camera and this four year service plan three days after i had to cancel my digital camera order for personal reasons however the 161.80 total i spent on this warrant did not refund automatically and nor have i received a confirmation that it will be refunded after several phone calls and emails of providing information for the requested refund they finally tell me that it will take 8 weeks for my refund to process that is two whole months horrible service i ca n't imagine how long it would take for them to either repair or replace my camera should it have faltered i would not recommend this four year service plan or any other plan by customer service companies to anyone ||| 0
the sound is really great but there is one problem with this headphones they keep falling from my ears no matter what rubber caps they come with 3 different sizes i used the design flaw makes them unusable for me ||| 0
the absolutely worst headphones i have ever had trying the different sizes the earplugs just do n't want to stay in my ears even standing still the headphones that come with the and the earlier version of lanyard headphones were both much better the sound was fine but not any better than the standard headphones a poor product i was very disappointed as i have had good experiences in general with apple in the past ||| 0
ok after reading the multiple good reviews on amazon i persuaded myself to buy these speakers thinking some people were just pessimistic ok i got these and immediately put a pair of batteries in these things sound absolutely awful it goes about the volume of someone quietly talking and the sound is distorted and fuzzy forget about any bass absolutely do not buy these things oh yeah whoever has been rating these things as good must be working for sony or something cu these things are terribl ||| 0
to anyone who may like these i am sorry to learn about your hearing disability the looked like a nice little package but i thought how could it possibly sound even acceptable '' i hoped for a sony surprise but it did n't happen when i returned them later that day the clerk asked '' is there anything wrong with them '' i said yeah they suck '' she smiled and handed me a refund ||| 0
i was excited about these headphones because creative usually has great products i was sadly disappointed the connector is clunky and surely going to wear out it 's flimsy wire on the jack the bluetooth signal is weak take a walk down the street and it begins to distort like crazy it also distorts at high volumes which you will need to use anyway because the sound is so low it runs out of power after only a few short hours and worst of all the headphones are impossibly tight causing real discomfort after only two days of using these headphones i could n't take it any more ||| 0
i really wanted to like the tomtom navigator 5. the gps itself is tiny and very sensitive it worked fine from down in a underdash cupholder or in the glove compartment the interface is attractive and easy to navigate the voice prompts are clear and loud the installation on a mac was problematic search on tomtom osx for details but suffice it to say that the installer included on the cds simply does n't work and a new one must be downloaded once past that it ran fine on my treo unfortunately there is one fatal flaw the map database in using the navigator in both california and north carolina the maps regularly had misnamed streets exits referred to by numbers where there were none and directions that lacked critical information like heading take the 101 instead of take when approaching a complex interchange worse the company seems to be actively hostile to updating these maps if you go to the tomtom site you can purchase maps on a basis are they newer than the ones that came with your unit who knows tomtom lists no version info and seems to expect you to buy and cross your fingers there were just too many errors that i saw while traveling in areas that i 'm familiar with to trust the tomtom maps for any unfamiliar territory everything else is great but the whole point of a gps is accurate navigation and sadly that 's where the tomtom navigator fails ||| 0

i 'll admit i 'm not the techno wizard some on this panel seem to be but then again i do n't believe you should have to be to operate what should be something simple like a handheld computer in essence the title of this review says it all almost 300 and several months later i am unable to get this hunk of junk to even turn on let alone connect to a server all of these things were supposed to be fixed by a 'patch ' that if someone can download from the hp website i 'd love to see it all downloads came back with an error message when i attempted to download long story short you 'd be better off buying a laptop hp is not known for their handhelds do not buy this product or anything similar to this from hp you will be sorry ||| 0
i like the light that goes on when the phone rings but that is about all i like about this phone friends tell me i sound like i am under water and i have had to terminate many conversations due to static and interference one friend insists that i have a microwave running as we speak i am actively looking for a new set to buy because these are worthless ||| 0
it looked flashy and on the web shopping sites that featured it however after setting up panasonic 's i 'm underwhelmed first of all even in this day and age it 's not though the pansonic call center representative had assured me after checking with her superior that it indeed was so i can not comment on downloading ringtones wallpapers etc meanwhile these mobile features were the main reason i wanted this particular cordless phone secondly the built in digital message recorder is of the lowest quality i was looking for an alternative to the monthly charge for voice mail through the phone company this is n't it if you prefer to record your own message in lieu of the generic message options your callers will here something sounding like a edison recording it struck me as odd that with the included audio cable you can connect the handset to an audio device with a headphone jack to record custom ring tones with good quality results yet to record a message for the digital answering machine you need to speak into the dinky little microphone hole on the base unit with the aforementioned low sound quality finally the battery life of the handset is rather short this is despite the too low backlighting on the handset keypad oh why no backlighting on the base unit ||| 0
i can not recommend hp to anybody anymore the company introduced regional coding which means printer cartridges from one region can not be used in another for most this is probably not an issue for those busily traveling around it is also it is an issue of principle its bad enough for dvd but printer cartridges hp has introduced this rather secretely and if you do n't read the box cover etc very carefully you may not notice the main issue is in europe i got caught out i bought a 3 catridges overseas i could not use them on my hp printer i asked for a refund hp email support us was nice but ineffective hp customer support europe was snotty and very rude i think hp does not care about its customers and this cost me over us 75 almost 50 of my printer my sixth and last hp do n't buy hp ||| 0

these speakers were a major disappointment i have speakers that are about 5 years old and wanted to replace them but these sony speakers were awful the sound was tinny the bass was almost and the sound was probably worse than that coming from my laptop speakers and these were n't even the cheap '' speakers there were many sets that cost less than this if you care at all about the quality of the speakers spend another 30 and get a decent set do n't buy ||| 0
these ear buds are large and hard they have sharp edges and hurt my ears i have large ears and large ear canals and wear other earbud type headphones all the time which do not bother me these were not only painful but did not enhance the sound but actually reduced it this product should be taken off the market ||| 0
using rechargeable aaa batteries with the battery saver feature turned on about two hours sometimes i get more using alkalines but not much more honestly this unit is worthless because i ca n't trust the batteries order a garmin etrex legend instead it is n't much more expensive larger or heavier and it includes a base map of roads towns and shorelines the legend comes with a cable to transfer data from your computer the legend 's screen is a bit larger but shows much more detail and the batteries last hours and hours ||| 0
this did not live up to its price or my expectations i walk to work and there was static on both am and fm ||| 0
takes 3 aaa batteries that in our experience run out too quick other units we 've owned have lower battery drain also the lcd display has poor contrast all in all i 'd buy another one that costs a few bucks more ||| 0
i ordered this charger a month ago since they 've sent me three chargers all the same all wrong they 've sent me the shuffle charger three times in a row do n't waste your money on this product for a few bucks more you can get a company that will actually send you the right product the first time ||| 0

i purchased a unit recently and after a couple hours tinkering with it i could n't get it to work i called support and spent almost an hour on the phone with them they advised me to uninstall their software and skype and to try reinstalling each product when that did n't work they told me the product was defective unfortunately they refused to take it back themselves and made me deal with the seller first not a very good seller btw as they gave me a terrible time when i tried to return the defective product hopefully you 'll have better luck also be sure to check out whether vosky is officially supporting skype when i made my purchase they did not ||| 0
if your cars dash is curved or sloping this mount will not work did not work on a 1988 mercedes or a daewoo lanos it might work if you have a perfectly flat dash i had to return the item as it did not sit properly even the slightest touch from a finger would make it slide down those of you who are clean freaks like me beware products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand ! i would not trust a 800 piece of equipment on an unreliable stand like this when even a slight touch of a finger can make it slide down what about jolts and bumps while normal driving i did not wait to find out using my 800 gps as an experiment ||| 0
i bought this to run ethernet into my daughter 's room the powerline etherernet works flawlessly i 've had it up and running for six months without restart or problem into three other rooms the wireless module however tends to overheat and drops the network after hours of operation so she has to unplug it every time she is done with the network and plugs it back in whenever she wants to connect i am going to upgrade her to another wired powerline ethernet module ||| 0
i posted a review two weeks ago but it has n't appeared so i 'm trying again i bought this lock two years ago it has always been difficult to remove note despite what some other reviewers seem to think it does not have a motion detector that 's a different lock recently the lock decided to remain firmly inside my ibook despite my efforts to remove it after a fruitless call to targus 's customer support i finally got it out that took over 30 minutes of struggle my next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw apparently the targus lock is not a good fit for ibooks i 'm going to send mine back and demand compensation if you own an ibook i strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than targus ||| 0
we drink a lot of coffee all day every day so we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and we first bought the capresso which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly the coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it so instead of another expensive capresso replacement we decided to try a japanese model which we thought might be more reliable we have been using the zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly no leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the capresso unfortunately there is no water filter system in this model compared to others we had taken this for granted and not checked for it and no reuseable metal mesh filter that i could find on the market instead of paper filters the water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds we are not sure why our coffee just does n't taste very good anymore but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality today we pulled out our very old krups proaroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement we will use this and the zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new capresso coffeemaker replacement do n't waste your money on this zojirushi model unless you do n't care about taste it was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine ||| 0
everyone has already covered the basics so here 's the highlights the audio listening quality is poor especially for drivers which normally sound good with strong bass response this is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad the headphones are heavy which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position they slide very easily off the head and apply a lot of downward force on the ears i have a big head and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure now they do n't slide off but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use at first the volume slider is stiff but then becomes smooth after 4 months of use the mute switch is getting loose i do n't expect it to work 4 months from now i really like the microphone portion of the headset the angle is adjustable and the volume is loud and clear in the end these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones next time i 'd grab the cheaper logitech headset where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears not some large outer pad ||| 0
i purchased this unit not for gaming but for making pc to pc calls here are my observations pros 1. sound quality of the microphone on the receiving end is reported by my friends and family as exceptionally clear certainly much better than what you 'd get out of a webcam 2. chord is robust and long easily fits over my long desk to my cpu that rests beneath 3. controls are easy to use although the mic switch does n't click into place like i 'd expect it to it just slides back and forth i can see people accidentally turning it off 4. headphones produce good sound although nothing extraordinary 5. the mic itself freely rotates so you can position it however you desire cons 1. first and foremost if you 've got a small head do not purchase this ! ! my head is not big and these headphones are not adjustable ! these headphones are so large that they 're actually uncomfortable their entire weight rests on my ears and i ca n't wear them for very long without my ears falling off 2. these headphones are very heavy uncomfortably so i 've resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears 3. perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler but it still feels like i 'm wearing a set of insulated ear muffs chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until i 'm dying of heat exhaustion 4. you need to get a y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time if you do n't have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again y splitters are only a few dollars but it 's an accessory you will have to purchase especially since front speaker ports on most computers ca n't be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one granted this is more of a general combo issue than anything logitek related but if this is your first purchase then you should be aware of this problem i use onboard audio instead of a sound card so i do n't have multiple output jacks 5. these headphones are designed to rest behind your neck not over the top of your head unfortunately the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back placing all the weight on your ears the plastic beam is also too short and just ! to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit 6. the design also does n't make sense the beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head it 's pretty uncomfortable if the headset was adjustable it would be fine ! the earpieces are just too huge ! overall i 'm disappointed with these if you 're under '' i say go with another model the hardware works great but the design is terrible i 'm returning these and purchasing an uglier but more functional set of smaller headphones ||| 0
the headset sits on the back of head which is ok however due to large ear rests it feals awkward and uncomfortable i was not able to use volume control as the headphones were only audible at higher volume level the mic is poor whether you want it for gaming or just general purpose use its better to skip this for something else ||| 0
i have been using the palmone navigator with my tx for about eight weeks most of my comments are based on a comparison with the navigation system in my lexus software installation is fairly easy however you need at least a 256 mb sd card to load more than a couple of states i recommend a 1 or 2 gb card while the concept of a tx doubling as a navigation device is intriguing the realty of it is rather sobering it is a cool toy but if you have to plan routes for your job or any other meaningful purpose this is not the right product the pros are inexpensive in comparison to und products unit can be used in different locations and cars and even while walking one device serves multiple purposes the cons are it can take up to several minutes after starting the unit to acquire a satellite signal this is not the case with my car 's oem navigation system the maps are outdated and not as precise as the oem nav system i live in phoenix az and my neighborhood built seven years ago as well as most of the freeways i take to work and back do n't exist on the software more recent updates are not available i checked the tomtom website navigation is often not precise enough it tells me to make a left in 50 yards when i have already passed the intersection where it wants me to make a left i never have this problem with the navigation function for addresses and phone numbers is clumsy and does n't display actual address until you map it it tends to freeze at least a couple times a day requiring a soft reset lost connections to the satellite receiver or lost satellite signals also tend to disrupt the navigation on longer trips with stops overall the unit is too unreliable to be used as your only navigational aid if you need navigation to get to your travel destination you are better off with a unit i truly wish i had better things to say about this device since i really like the concept but the reality just does n't match the marketing ||| 0
the good news is that this is a full featured gps solution that is easy to mount in the car and can navigate to contacts in your address book maps are detailed and the poi point of interest database is fairly extensive the bad news is that it all too often fails to connect via bluetooth installation of software and maps is error prone do not follow any of the 'advanced ' hints in the manual they scrambled my sd card only buy this product if you like puzzle solving and have a great deal of patience if you are expecting an out of the box solution that is 100 reliable look elsewhere ||| 0

for over eight years nearly 9 i had an acer 17 '' crt loved it i use a kvm to switch computers the crt kept all of my adjustments for that computer every time when it started showing signs of age about four months ago i decided to try a flat screen or lcd though i 've heard horror stories about them my laptop is great i do n't mind the dark overlay associated i have that on my laptop i was amazed at how poorly this monitor responds to things i still swap computers i ca n't get the same clarity that i once did i swap between me xp which should n't matter do n't believe there is n't any flicker that 's wrong if you change the refresh rate the monitor changes not the computer what happened to dumb monitors what happened to dumb printers best should be a button turn on away some tweaking is n't bad fade out i have the monitor at the proper '' height the upper lower corners fade as looking at any lcd from an angle you ca n't tilt this monitor very much at all do n't spend much time on shut down or in me the lines jaggies will kill you i 'm sorry that i bought this monitor the refesh rate for games is fair do n't play any games prior to me ! because me era games fade badly at the ends nearly blacking out post xp is n't anything to write home about really i would suggest trying out an hdtv first with a direct vga plug in it 's a few dollars more but if you 're considering an hdtv as well as a monitor i 'd chance it you can always buy a 20 '' crt for less i hope this helps ||| 0
the keyboard with this set is flimsy and cheap feeling worse the layout is nonstandard they 've messed up the key cluster above the arrows and the right hand ctrl is not below the right end of the shift key it is under the left end of the shift key where one of the windows keys the context menu one normally is they 've taken out one of the windows menu keys too the wireless features worked fine i 've used it two days and worked even without installing their driver software something i 'm always reluctant to do i think some of the extra buttons multimedia controls on the keyboard do n't work for me because of this i use the computer it 's on for work not screwing around so this does n't bother me i have it installed on a thinkpad laptop so i can keep the screen farther from my eyes and my employer bought the thing it would n't have been my first choice i 've given it two stars only because it worked great out of the box with no driver software this is on a thinkpad running winxp i 'm already dreading the battery usage based on another review here thankfully it 's not my main keyboard ||| 0
ive had this unit for over a year and ran into problems with reception it would drop signal and it would eventual come back i found out that this unit had a defect and the xm rep said i could get a replacement for 50 ! ! ! they didnt figure to tell anybody about this if this is true i would not recommend xm radio at all thanks john ||| 0
i have to admit the price of this item got me it 's now 40 bucks down the drain as it has failed to work completely it worked for about 8 months but was very fuzzy the quaility was that of an am radio station recently it quit working altogether so now i am back in the market for one that will work ||| 0

it is an okay printer i have n't done photos yet and pretty fast but i have to change the cartridges every weeks this is just home use i 'm talking about not business use the cartridges are small run out real fast and cost up to 60 a month for one black and one color i 'm thinking of going back to a lexmark ||| 0
i bought this printer because i wanted high quality photo printing and i did n't need any of the bells and whistles that come with more expensive printers it 's a canon so i figured i could count on the photo quality i was terribly disappointed though i generally buy staples brand photo paper for general photo printing and it always worked fine with my epson printer but my first prints on this printer looked dull and muddy like i was looking at the images though a mild but annoying haze so i went out and bought canon paper instead the quality was somewhat improved but still not what i had expected so yes i got a printer for under 30 but now to get even passably ok prints i need to spend a fortune on canon brand inks and paper not much of a bargain ||| 0

pros fits like a glove goes without saying um peace of mind cons this case makes pushing the buttons harder than it already is there is nothing to protect the screen if you 're or like to operate gadgets with your left hand note that it is impossible to push the menu button it would take a freak of nature to comfortably push it the case is a dust and hair magnet every time you pull it out of your pocket it 's encrusted with lint you did n't even know you had dust manages to sneak under every surface and hair magically sticks to it this case is a paradise for forensic experts one of the features of a memory player is the fact that they wo n't break as easily when you drop them unless you 're paranoid about getting scratches on your shiny new sansa do n't buy this ||| 0
i bought this product from kb electronics because of this product my digital camera stopped working on giving a bad review to this product kb electronics offered me 10 discount on my next product so i told them that i would give a good review to them if they can repair my camera at this they went silent so basically this means that they would try to make someone silent with a few dollars but if they have to fix their problems then they would forget all morals and turn dumb i do n't know about the current company but beware of the same thing happening to you guys it is possible that kb electronics has started selling the same product by the name of its sister concern businesses do this all the time ||| 0
i bought this player a little over a year ago mainly for the ability to upgrade the firmware to played everything i put in it until a few days ago when it started having intermittent graphics were staticy and blocky sound would just buzz and it would n't eject discs until i shut it down and restarted it that lasted for two days before the problem became permanent now it 's a doorstop the apex web site appears to be down right now but based on the other reviews here i doubt there 's much point in contacting them ||| 0
the resaon i purchased this sport case is because it was an apple product my thoughts were that is i was going to dive into the ipod experience i should invest in a quality case to protect it i 'm sure that most people would think the way i do i read the reviews and felt that even though it was a little pricey i would go ahead this product is not a good one for the price mine broke specifically the plastic slider on the side that locks the shuffle in i know what your thinking she abused the product but i swear i did not i loathe returning things but darn it this is ridiculous avoid this one and go for something less expensive ||| 0
though the concept is great and the controls are straight forward and easy to use the belkin reader falls short of usability while out on a location i was away from a power source and thought the belkin reader would be a great alternative to lugging a laptop around for file transfers trying to transfer 1000 pics off a cf card was impossible the reader would drain a fully charged ipod and still not finish the transfer though it claims firewire transfer speeds i did some tests from home and found otherwise 100 compressed pics transferred via card reader to computer 1 min 20 sec pcmcia card reader in laptop 45 seconds belkin media reader 6 min 45 sec this was just a simple example you can see how hundreds of files would take 30 minutes or more for the price i 'd suggest buying a few more memory cards and not worry about the transfers until you get home unless you 're in no rush and can charge up the ipod regularly ||| 0

i adore my nano but this armband is one of the worst products i have ever bought i work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout the spacing of the velcro dots means i never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime i do weight lifting close to my body it is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is i am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage ||| 0
either i am idiot or this product is very poorly designed ! it takes forever to get it just right so that it wo n't slip off and still it feels uncomfortable and not quite right now they have them in sorts of colors do n't buy it you 'll just get annoyed everytime you want to use it like me ||| 0
i bought the armband when i got my mini ipod however the belt clip that comes with the ipod is perfect to clip to my shorts while jogging you do n't need this large clunky armband ||| 0
i found the armband to be uncomfortable and inconvenient i think the upper arm is just a bad place to carry an ipod the added weight is distracting when i 'm running even worse is any activity that requires me to flex my biceps at all so lifting weights is out put it on too tight and i constrict the muscle loosen it a little and the band slips off there is no happy medium also the earphone cord gets in the way more when it 's leading from my arm the belt clip that came with my ipod mini works much better for me i clip it on the waistband of my sweatpants when i 'm working out and it remains very secure even when i 'm running on the treadmill and the cord stays close to my body where it is far less likely to get caught on something the only advantage of this product is that it lets you advertise to the world that you own an ipod mini big deal my armband is destined to be forgotten in the back of a drawer at home ||| 0
do not waste your money on this product ! ! whilst amazon has a very good price for it the headset is junk ! i tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum the hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines it could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible i work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes this set is very poor quality and not worth the money ||| 0
amazon quickly shipped this item to me and i was ready to rock 'n ' roll until i plugged it in there was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear the buzzing noise stopped when i hit mute so the plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem amazon was very gracious about their return policy and i was quickly sent a new phone free of charge well the second phone does the same thing and i 'm returning it to get a refund maybe just my phone line possibly but i 've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both ||| 0
bought and was glad i could send it back after a testing period tried it witih ableton live on os x and a macbookpro sound quality was okay but either the buffer was too small which caused the sound to scratch every few seconds or the buffer was too large which ended in a lag causing me to get distracted from my i tried for about two hours to find the right balance but it did n't work out this microphone might have a nice sound but i ca n't recommend it for high standard voice recording ||| 0
the card lasted about 3 months then just died i 'm disappointed considering the cost when it was working it seemed to have better range than my builtin centrino web access card i do n't know if i got a lemon but now i have to check the warranty ||| 0
the card worked really well except for one little thing there is no way to enbale super g mode you need it to connect at without the most i could connect at was the quick install guide and the manual said it 's available but it was n't tech support was able to reproduce my problem and tried many many things even though they were very helpful they coudl n't fix it my guess is that it 's going to take a firmware upgrade to enable super if you can wait for that then you will be happy i returned mine and bout a linksys ||| 0
like another reviewer i had the model and loved them comfortable secure decent sound and indestructable i was hoping these would be new and improved '' well they are new i really do not like them the seem to be at least as good as the which is fine but the new design does not work for me at all for 3 reasons 1. the bigger band that goes over the top of the head is almost square flat on top instead of curved so the weight all rests right on the crown of my head 2. the smaller band instead of keeping it secure just loosens up rather than hanging on 3. the earpads which were on wobbly stalks on the to match the angle of the ears are fixed on this model so they push more on the rear edges of my ears and push the headphones forward the quality of the electronics and sound do n't do much good if the things are a pain to wear maybe they will work well for some head shapes but not for mine bummer maybe i can find the old model somewhere ||| 0
i ca n't say enough positive about logitech mice this device however was a dismal disappointment the pc interface works well and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive unfortunately that in no way translates into a good remote interface the ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor and for those with video recorder boxes very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available if its there at all its hidden many keystrokes deeper than i care to know about even when reverting to manual operation of individual components changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes a much more irritating trait than one might think overall for functionality i actually consider the remote that came with my scientific atlanta dvr vastly superior to the harmony which i 've given up on after only a few days of forced use considering the ridiculous pricetag i strongly advise you save yourself a lot of money and your relatives a lot of frustration this year by steering clear of this sad study in user interface failure ||| 0
i have 2 10 year old natural keyboards with the old keyboard layout and when i saw this new keyboard with the same layout i bought one sadly this keyboard is painful to use the keys especially the space bar require far more force to use that my previous keyboard i am a software engineer and used to typing but this keyboard has slowed my typing rate and wears me out after 20 minutes on the shelf it goes for emergencies as i 'll continue to maintain my old keyboard ||| 0
used this unit for a few weeks and returned annoyances sofware with adf scanning you have to enter scan parameters paper size etc again for every scan and it does not have an option to let you to continue scanning more pages then adf can hold you will have to use add to file '' function and select all scan parameters again there is no option to scan pages as well with using 2 pass scanning so party software is definitively needed to get a real value out of adf scanning color scanning while scans are fast color scanning speed is very poor to me scanning stack of color pages could take ages slow color scanning speed was observed in both usb and network modes fax number of rings before fax answers is limited to 4 and i found no way to increase that no good for soho ||| 0
confusing light display looking in the manual told me there was a paper jam after printing three pages there is no jam there is nothing stuck in the printer sending it back now i do not have time to troubleshoot a new printer that fails to work properly after three pages maybe you wo n't have time either ! i am very tech savvy and have checked the manual the device simply is defective i also noted that the top lid that folds down for packing to travel seems very flimsy it 's hard to imagine it would not break in time and since it 's the paper feeder you 'd be out of luck i 'd recommend something else ||| 0

these are some great headphones buy them from somewhere else ! i chose to buy them here because of the lower price big mistake what i recieved wase n't the item picutered i do n't know if there an older version or some the sound is ok but there very cheaply made and theres something wrong with the hinges they do n't fold properly i have an average size head and even fully extended to put them on you have to warp the headband to the point that it looks like its about to break returned them and spent the extra 20 bucks to buy them from the actual site ||| 0
worked well when it was working massive bass response comfortable cushioning for big ears and funky styling only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction however none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase gave absolutely no signs before hand just working one day completely dead the next there are other reviewers here that shared my same fate so if you want to gamble with these go ahead but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones ||| 0

this is my second one of these i pinched off the cable on my first one with a storage console door and had to get another ! the display has two settings very dim and off the one i had before was quite bright so they must have changed something that said it works perfectly you should n't be looking at the display while driving anyway ||| 0
a 150 calculator that i am going to trash i had the same problem with the keyboard terrible response i struggled with it for about a year and then called hp my warranty was out so hp suggested i install an update which i did now the keys are firing off 3 or 4 digits with one press of the button this is ridiculous ||| 0
i am an rpn devotee and have owned two other hps going back to the original but this calculator is horribly unreliable because it seems to ignore key entries occasionally although you hear and feel the click nothing happens also the keys themselves may bust loose '' and start to wobble even after little use this is my third replacement in the last two years be sure and save your receipt because quality control is absent on this one ||| 0
this was my first set of headphones and i bought them because they are cheap well you get what you pay for being disappointed with the fit of the koss phones i bought the slightly more expensive jvc at least for me a much better fit which means more comfort and better sound and i am still shopping the array of offerings is daunting jvc and jplug at about 20 all the way up to shure 's top of the line at 500 so shop around but forget about the koss ||| 0
this warranty is purchased through amazon but it is actually distributed by another company when you search for tv warranties on amazon you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same but are different prices i called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was they told me that there is no difference between the 119 warranty and the 499 warranty they cover the exact same thing the girl i spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference warranties are a tricky item to review because it all looks good until you actually need it so on this one i suppose only time will tell the one difference between the amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the tv but i figure if i need to replace the bulb within those four years i will still be saving 100 because i can get a new bulb for around 200 ||| 0
bought this as a for the internal hard drive of the laptop my experience was sadly similar to many others on this site worked fine for two backups then the drive stopped being recognized by my own or any other computer little red power '' light is on little disc whirls around but no blue data transmit '' light appears anymore these are clearly a dismally unreliable and poorly made just imagine the disaster if this occurred when you were trying to restore data to a corrupted hard drive on your primary machine a free replacement would not be much of a compensation avoid ! ! ||| 0

the ipod is cool but ours as we 've found has happened to many other owners went on the fritz and our nightmare began apple 's customer service is the worst cs that we 've ever experienced regardless of the product or service supported i could write for days about the awful experience but i 've wasted so much time with them already i ca n't bear to waste more the most notable point is that the ipod cs folks repeatedly stated that ipods are more or less disposable commodity items and breakdowns '' were common wow ! ! 400 bucks of throw away ! ! ! we still have n't recieved the return box for after several days even though it was promised in hours we also own an player that we refer to as a '' from dell computer and have had to use their customer service as well dell 's cs support was awesome based on our experience with cs support this is the first and last apple product that will be owned in our household ||| 0
i purchased this item on 17 2006. amazon claimed it was in stock i then upgraded from free shipping to standard which promises a days delivery time amazon now informs me that it will arrived on ! this is the second recent order with a longer than delivery time i do n't know if amazon is going down hill or what but it 's discouraging next time i 'll just buy the item locally and pay a few extra dollars and by the way do n't even try to call amazon customer service at they ca n't do anything to resolve a problem and barely speak or understand english another great american company moving towards metiocracy what a shame ||| 0
short answer the microphone volume on this is set too low relative to the speaker volume and can not be adjusted independently either through the device or at the level i spoke with tech support and they said this was to keep the software from having issues so as a speakerphone this device is useless i 'd have given it one star but the rest of the device is actually very well designed easy to setup and so on ||| 0

i was fairly satisfied with this phone until i had to my office and move my phone once i moved it and then tried to reconnect it i no longer had lcd functionality or speakerphone functionality i looked on their website and this is what it said on their faq problem no caller id information received does the lcd screen on the handset show anything no your telephone is defective and needs to be sent in for service since it is on their faq i would assume this is a common problem in trying to exchange my phone they were insistent that i send my phone in first so they could look at it and then refurbish it exchange it since i use this phone for my home office this was problematic for me i would not recommend this product i personally will not by panasonic again due to the quality of customer support or lack thereof that i received ||| 0

yes i burned them in for at least 25 hours they sounded muddy smooth as caramel but veiled the bass was heavy and indistinct the high frequencies were not clean and not abundant having listened to stax headphones for years and years i know i got used to a superclean almost clinical sound but still i can not believe how completely different the were i borrowed these from a friend who bought them new and had hardly used them frankly i get more pleasure listening with my sony sports headphones that i bought for less than 10 i am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews i would love to hear a headphone that sounds as wonderful as people are describing but the one i heard did not not even after never would i consider one of these phones without auditioning them perhaps i truly heard a rare defective unit but if so both drivers were defective because they sounded the same ||| 0
button size time is crap when used with the best batteries button many bugs with files often end corrupt in various ways meaning you get over is crap also it cant convert to o and did i mention you have to convert in general not true for all ic recorders which others record directly in for example is without noice reduction is the most fragile ic recorder ever consumer grade product not a professional grade product go with the following made by olympus it smokes this ic recorder by a mile and its tough and goes for about the same price perhaps cheaper ||| 0

it is rather ironic that this device was so cheap that despite the fact that it will not charge an ipod shuffle it cost more to ship it back than i would get in a refund bought from an amazon associated store tiger direct for 4.99 i also bought the matching car charger for 3.99 neither works with the ipod shuffle oh well belkin makes a ipod dock connector to usb adapter that allows you to use your existing fw based stuff for charging only i think that is the ticket for charging the shuffle on the road ||| 0
while this device does power your usb cable it seems to fail charging my blackberry or my ipod maybe the 400 ma is not enough for that i would not suggest to buy this item for these devices for the ipod you better get the usb charger from the apple store for 25 that even comes with a standard ipod cable ||| 0
i recently received an ipod photo and after loading in tons of cd 's i said hey why not buy an all in 1 adapter for my car my transpod arrived but i had difficulty inserting the adapter into my car 's charger after working that out and using it everyday for a week it stopped working i realized that the fuse had blown it 's small and relatively compact unlike the griffin roadtrip but it 's a whole lot of drama for the price with regard to the quality of the sound through my vehicle 's audio system i am extremely disappointed what sounds like a million dollars through headphones does not translate to what you hear through fm radio frequencies i have adjusted the ipod 's equalizer and played around with some options inside my car but i am extremely disappointed if someone has a better alternative god bless you but do n't waste your money on this product ||| 0
my first mouse broke after only a few uses when i sent it back for repairs they sent back a refurbished mouse that did not work at all avoid buying this mouse at all costs ||| 0
when it works this mouse is simply wonderful small accurate easy to recharge easy to carry under those conditions it 's probably my favorite mouse i 've found that it 's equally good for both mac and windows one complaint is that when it 's tethered to the usb port for recharging it works nominally but becomes very slow and awkward it 's not at all the same behavior as seen when it 's completely free to move my first incarnation of mouse lived a long life of about 10 months my second incarnation of mouse however just died at the tender age of 4 months i 've attempted resuscitation but to no avail having found that iogear technical support exists by name only i have sent multiple requests for help and have received not a single answer both mice died identical deaths suddenly it stops being able to hold a charge and freezes after about 5 minutes of use even when tethered to the usb port for a recharge it freezes i 'm sad that a technologically good product should have such terrible quality assurance in its manufacture and such terrible customer support in dealing with its lack of qa ||| 0
what a waste of money for 300 you should n't have to buy a protection plan for the year of a products life unfortunately the poor quality of ipods makes it a necessity but the protection plan is riddled with clauses that exclude any number of reasonable issues i 've bought apple for the last 15 years but never again will i send them my money ||| 0
although this policy is thru apple it is the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations one is which has a 2 plan for 29.99 which starts the standard apple 1 yr labor coverage for a total of 3 years apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for 59.99 rather than a total of 3 years for 29.99 thru crutchfield ||| 0

maybe 2 stars software and wireless setup for this card went fine even great and have continued to work for over 1 years now but here 's the rub seems the housing on the card that receives the threads of the antenna was not properly attached to the board the antenna would not work properly signal strength from the access point in the next room when it was n't falling off the back of my machine ! futzed with the thing getting performance with it for toooo long until had to remove board from computer use plier to remove antenna from the recept and verry carefully place the card in a vice and use tool to forcefully slide the '' housing in place onto the board did this once and it did n't seat far enough antenna fell off and a couple weeks later had to repeat the process apparently it needed to be pressed on even further and it actually snapped securely the time after using more force that you might imagine on such a delicate device it has worked as advertised since then about a year now there are other reviewers who have suffered from antenna drops off '' too be warned when one pays extra for quality '' they should expect better than this it 's time again to add to my network and will try a different board for half the price ||| 0
this charger is flimsy 1 as other mention the retractable '' unit quickly became tangled and without significant attention every single time not feasible while driving does n't retract 2 the plastic covering the wire at the base of the jack pulled loose exposing the wires 3 after a few months of very gentle use the white plastic cover of the jack cracked and fell off as a result i 'm back in the market for a charger just months after buying this one ||| 0
i tried them on a sony and they clogged my heads in about of recording the camera has worked fine for about two years now and it 's the first time i use other than sony this camera went to the sony service center for a full about two months ago and worked perfectly fine until i tried these tapes i read somewhere that the tapes have a surface compound that lubricates the head and that it is incompatible between brands clogging the tape head when the different compounds mix in it i did n't believe it then and stil not according to that maybe they are fine and you only have to stick with the brand and i 'll do but another one ||| 0
after purchasing my canon this summer and using the four pack of tdk tapes abc warehouse gave me with the camcorder i went online and found these tapes and bought two ten packs due to the great price and the jvc name they have only done one thing clogged up my video head on the camcorder i videotape my sons basketball games for their coaches and it was only after the first couple of games and bad recordings that i got onto canon 's website and realized my video head was clogged i purchased a head cleaner and the first tape after the cleaning taped great but the next tape clogged my head up so to use these tapes i highly recommend you clean your video head after each use which is not good for your video head on your camcorder ||| 0

do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i 'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me 340.00 and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive ||| 0
the features size and design of this unit are what drew me in but after just a few uses i quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive but completely unusable package to start with the unit is small the smallest of its kind but the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace second the unit has a rechargeable battery that can not be removed so when it crashes which it does frequently there is no way to '' the unit by removing the battery this is also a problem because it reduces the unit 's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no ac power to recharge it then what you have is a paperweight oh and by the way when you do have it plugged in to charge the backlight is always on even if the power is off so forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either but all of this aside the firmware simply does not work it locks up incessantly and with no way to reboot you literally have to unplug it wait for it to and hope that you can start the machine up again and to add insult to injury the body is a cheap piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones overall do n't be taken in by the low price paying any amount of money is too much for a unit that does n't work ||| 0

run winxp with everything updated i 've had this router for 6 months it is the firmware updated i never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone while reading the reviews my desktop pc 's graphics card went down this past week and i had to rma it so about 10 days to send out and get a return i have always used a wired connection for my home desktops the wireless access was a 'it 's there if i need it ' novelty i started brining my ibm laptop home from work so i could get online vpn into work this is the first time i have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so the last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least i logged on my first day and lost connection times browsing msn and yahoo at first i thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11. i went ahead and disabled the feature since i had never come close to hitting that speed anyways and changed the i used the ibm thinkvantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used i changed channels and i verified my signal strength before and after i changed 95 signal strength the connection is still getting dropped randomly changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength no difference scanned the networks again using the ibm thinkvantage theres my router 97 signal strength unplugged router modem repaired my winsocks with winsockxp rebooted pc i turned on my modem first until is was ready to go then the router until it was ready and then my pc as per the netgear website and yea no difference in the connections stability the conection is still getting dropped randomly i might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered but i hardly ever used the wireless access yes wireless radio has been off after reading these reviews i am pretty sure the problem wont go away the part that upsets me the most i payed premium money for a product that i thought was premium if this had been priced at the time at bargain bin prices i would n't of but it was n't and i do the 'you get what you pay for ' saying does not hold true for this product buyer beware ||| 0

i wanted to connect a computer to a router and the computer was going to be pretty far away from the router so i figured i needed a long cord and decided to get this one which is supposed to be cat 5 stranded patch which was what i needed well it 's long that 's the only good thing about this cord but the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless there is nothing on the ends ! it 's just a giant wire ! there are n't any connectors on the ends that i can use to plug the cord into my computer or the router so i have a cord but no connectors it 's completely useless unless i buy the connectors separately and attach them myself do i know how to do that do i want to do that no so i 'm returning this maybe if all you need is the cord it 's grey by the way and not the connectors you might be able to use this otherwise it 's completely useless if you ca n't find any cords this long that have connectors maybe you should consider trying a shorter cord ||| 0

i have really enjoyed my i pod until i started to get errors in january 2006. i started to get an error that state that itunes ca n't read to or write form the disk meaning the ipod itself that means i can not add music to or take music off of the iopd this was very upsetting to me as i have had this item for less than a year i finlay called tech support at apple they asked for the serial for my ipod they told me it was out of warranty that the warranty had expired in december of 2005 and there was nothing i could do literally i checked my purchase and found out that i had purchased this on april 7 2005. i was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was not so this is a warning to all ipod owners of this potential problem ||| 0

my wife bought this as a gift for me thinking that it included an fm tuner for ten dollars more she could have purchased a product that does everything this one does it is essentially a 35 car charger plus the tuner if you want to use this product to actually listen to your ipod in your car you 'll need to purchase yet another device either the cassette adapter old school ! part or the fm transmitter part either one connects through a jack in the side of this unit the fm transmitter is another 40 you 're now over what the monster icarplay which does all of the above would have cost you and surprise ! the transmitter takes aaa batteries ! there 's no way to power the transmitter through the auto kit to power the fm transmitter without batteries you must purchase yet a third accessory the mobile power cord for ipod '' just 15 ! except your car 's power plug is occupied by the auto kit so you 'll need to buy a adapter for that are we having fun yet i 'm not and am wishing i 'd skipped all this nonsense and just purchased the icarplay in the first place ||| 0

very bad start bad point for amazon i wanted to get a good quality device and that is the reason i chose buying from amazon even it was more expensive than other sites i just turned on the device and tried to search for broadcasts it was like all the radios in us were shut down or at least in my region by mistake i filliped the device and surprise the device started receiving radio signal after that everything seemed to be ok but some strange noise in headphones cons while operating the radio pros great sound with other than manufacturer provided headphones long operating time using rechargeable battery excellent expandable via sd cards feature i love the flip display capability i really love that device because of its features and i hope it was only my mischance getting a damaged one however i requested amazon the replacement of the device instead of reimbursement i also already advised some friends to buy that device as a good point for amazon the very fast answer when i requested the replacement of the device i will come back with updates after i receive the replacement hope a good one next time thank you amazon team coming back after receiving the replacement device first of all it was a very good idea buying amazon fulfilled products even it was a bit more expensive than other sellers the replacement came faster than the product excellent amazon team and very professional it 's a pleasure doing business with you the device works perfectly really a device you must have more than that my friends i recommended the player are very happy with their new acquisition they were luckier than me 5 stars for the product now ||| 0

i had a usb adaptor before which was really good but was old i upgraded to a wireless g linksys usb adaptor but i was supplied with old goods a linksys sales manager confirmed that so i sent that back i thought i 'd try again bad move first i tried to upgrade the drivers my current version was i downloaded the version 1.12 from 's site after uninstalling and reinstalling several times i still had an hour and a half on the phone with tech support and i still had another hour on google and i 'm not the only one with this issue seems to be a issue with then even more irritating every time after i use my wired connection and go back to wireless i have to reinstall the drivers and reboot and all my security info again i believe this has something to do with using a different usb port from the last time but whatever the reason it 's unacceptable this adaptor 's going back too do n't know what i 'll try next ||| 0

i have a tower mac that did have a built in ethernet unfortunately a lightening strike took out the port and i was forced to get a pci card to replace the port the first card i bought was the i was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with macs and that the minimum requirement '' was os they lied os 10.2 is the for this card for most people it wo n't work with 10.3 and up has no driver for 10.3 or higher only a google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with i could n't i tried several different drivers some users recommended a driver from realtek and none worked it 's my guess and totally a guess that this card is really only for older macs that are limited to does n't seem to have any intention of supporting modern macs this is the second product i 've used the first was a cable modem and i 've been disappointed both times i ca n't speak for windows users but this company does n't deserve mac business ||| 0

these radios look nice but there are some problems here first the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands the receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times i also hace a and the difference is like night and day the 7200 is the best the 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low i paid 24.00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for 44.00 today what good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying good try motorola but this is a poor recommended to purchase ||| 0
i ordered this radio back in may and i still do n't have them it is now september i have exchanged several emails with amazon the first one i received a very nice but untrue reply the second response was borderline rude but at least honest they told me that they do n't have the product and do n't know when they will if you are looking for something to use now do n't waste your time with ordering this radio ||| 0
the box says you can either power '' or charge '' your ipod with the powerjolt to me power '' means listening to the ipod while it is plugged in to the powerjolt however there is an overwhelming amount of buzz and static when the ipod is playing while connected to the powerjolt maybe this thing works ok to charge '' while the ipod is not playing but it is not an acceptable way to power '' the ipod while it is playing ||| 0
i commute via public transportation the majority of that on a noisy train earbuds and over ear headphones do n't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music i received these philips headphones as a gift when i first got these i was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared i have some koss over ear head phones which are nice and beefy these are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space they use a single aaa batt using them on the train i was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through i 'm not an expert on these but i guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through the next thing i noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off my koss and sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there or it runs through the headphone band i realize i like this single cord feature very much again these philips hn 110 do n't have this i also noticed that when the noise cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified after about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside now i ca n't open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones i checked philips website for info on these phones but i could n't find any i called their customer support and they told me i had to call a different i called the different number and got the return merchandise authorization but was told i need to send the receipt in i got them as a gift so i do n't have the receipt in summary their noise cancelling ability is pretty week better than my hefty cancelling koss over ears or my stethascope like sony ear buds but only by about 10 or so just to put a number in their flimsy design cords from both earphones hear the wind amplified battery compartment latch broke after a month and a half and their warrenty sucks ||| 0
after only having the cable for a week under very light usage the cable stopped working intermittently it makes crackling noises when the cable is moved i am not talking about whipping or quick movement just gentle movement of the cable causes crackling and loss of signal i was about to scrap the cable altogether but i decided to resolder the connector to see if that would help i cut off about half a foot of the cable and resoldered it only to find that the same problem persisted i got a bad cable ||| 0
the was a gift looked like a great little portable stereo for my pod first used it on a trip started off playing ok and then the sound cut in and out frustrated me for the week as i did n't know if it would play or not on any given day when it did play it was ok but not great finally it did n't play anymore returned it to the apple store where purchased to find that there was only a 15 day return policy and i missed it by 2 days so i tried to contact altec lansing the phone number in the owners book did n't work although i tried for several days then i emailed the altec support email no response after two emails sometimes a product does n't work and it 's easy to return or get repaired on this one it looks like this product will be finding the trash can do not buy ||| 0

i bought the tdk mojo 256 about a year and 3 months ago it worked wonderfully for the first year did what it was supposed to and the radio quality was great then i upgraded to windows xp and that 's when everything started going wrong this player needs propreitary software to copy files from your hard disk or cd to the player unfortunately the software does n't work well at all with xp right now my player is piece of junk i have tried copying files which it shows as copied but then when you reconnect the player they do n't show up on there what 's more formatting the internal memory will also not release the space and so i have the internal memory full but it shows up in the software as free however it wo n't copy over any new files and gives me a storage full '' error it does n't act reliably with xp either and i had to unplug and replug several times for it to even read the list of songs on the it lasted all of 15 months while it sounds like a great deal good features for price do not buy this if you will be using it with xp and if you do please do n't expect it to last more than months ||| 0
this player is a piece of junk first the usb really doesnt mean you can hot swap you can access the files only if the software is installed on the computer which means that you can not pick up from any computer second it gives errors with xp it tries to install drivers every time third removing old and adding new is such a hassle it takes minutes to delete old files and add new seems like you are working with a floppy fourth its mojo software hangs all the time fifth it sucks battery life sixth if your is not in a directory if copied directly it wont show then it wont delete and will show 200 mb as not free space formatting is the only way out seventh it came with a mail in rebate which never showed up overall a bad experience ||| 0
does the unit work well yes to a degree it takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances the display is poor and though they say up to 40 objects per hole '' there is normally objects per hole all this depends upon the skycaddie course recorder the user you can not modify the course or add any objects that the course recorder did n't think was important now the bad part the unit attaches via button and belt clip like a cell phone my button part that attaches to main unit has died twice in the first 30 days when it breaks again which it will often unit will probally hit the dirt this is n't good but fear not it will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with skygolf and another week to get a replacement button which has been modified even weaker than the original one now my replacement broke on the first time i clipped it to the belt now back to skycaddie to get another after being on hold for another hour they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts this will take another hour you then get a message to leave a message normally within a week someone will call you back by normally i mean about 35 of the time you leave messages they return them would i buy another duh no ||| 0
you do n't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel there 's no gold inside ! so there 's no need for gold tipped multi sheilded super mega supreme cables if you do n't believe me buy this cable and a cheapie compare them for yourself you will see no difference with analog signals a good quality cable may make a difference although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope ||| 0
have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you an arm and a leg '' these cables cost that your first son and bidding rights to your estate do n't get me monster makes great cables let there be no confusion on this point but they 're just incredibly expensive and this is made much worse with these cables several people have pointed out that the digital signal on hdmi cables must adhere to and certain standards even a 10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production and this is largely true unless bluray implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future there 's really very little difference between hdmi cables yes the pins and other features will improve your connection a bit but the improvement will be far less than you 'd see between any other cheap '' versus designer '' cables on the market but monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference and that 's worth mentioning this cable is built sturdy so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it and the shielding is n't just the usual electrical monster cables are toughened to the point that i would n't doubt if they 're certified against nuclear fallout if you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an emp strike you 're looking at the right cables but for nearly all consumers these cables cost as much as alternatives with no real plusses at the very least you can pick up a cable sony etc at a price 40 to get the increased sturdiness and the connections and over these products the monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding please do look up a cheaper alternative this time and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean you 'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about 100 hdmi cables ||| 0
what do they say about fools and money hdmi uses tmds which is a digital transmission system with error correction tmds has been designed to work over cheap cabling and a 10 hdmi cable will meet the specification if you spend 9 times more on this cable than another one then you have just wasted 80 that 's all there is to it you do n't need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable the picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a 90 cable over a 10 in fact the signal is identical let me repeat hdmi devices talk digitally with error correction this cable and ones like it are for suckers only ||| 0
if you ca n't abide an low hiss in the background and louder interference in the presence of power lines do n't buy this product i wish i 'd read the reviews more carefully before i bought a number of even the most favorable ones mentioned this annoyance the manufacturer replaced the first unit after i complained but it was no improvement this may be the best product of its type out there but it still comes up short ||| 0
i think this product design concept is great i love the flexibe arm size it fits great in my car the crappy part i live near metro louis and i could not hold a signal anywhere ! i always had some intereference whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out this product did not meet my expectations especially since the back of the package states i should have crystal clear sound this is not true i have returned this product after little success over the first week of purchase i am now waiting to get my dlo transpod 2 in the mail to try it out i want something to work ! ||| 0
i have to say since i really started listening to music i have payed attention to a lot more detail of sound with that said i am not a bass junky but bass and compression of the overall mix is what makes a sound a good sound i currently owned a pair of sony that cost me dollars a year ago i am a medical student and i study all day and all night but can not have my music blasting conversely i needed to have a nice isolation of my sound comparing my old sony to the new that i just got i am extremely dissapointed with their performance i was expecting a great sound with minimal noise from the outside and get almost no response at the level that i studied with my old ear buds to be fair remember that these are not noise cancelling they are noise reducing there is no component involved here they are basically really good earplugs with speakers in them my wife just ran the vacuum and i barely heard it the earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable however my other ones sony earbuds sound better a combination of the two would be great keep in mind that this is my opinion and make your own based on why you are buying earbuds environmental sound reduction is great sound quality is not as good as some others your fault and pay attention to pricing ||| 0
i was disappointed with these earphones the sound level was low and higher frequency sound seemed attenuated the 30 sony earphones i already owned sounded much better ||| 0
i have had the 325 model for less than a year up until recently i was satisfied with its performance using it to print less than 5 pictures at a time recently i needed to print a series of pictures more than 10 in one sitting and had an error cartridge fixed the paper jam but continued to get the error message i called hp and they stated this was a fatal error in the unit and encouraged me to purchase the updated model rather than fix my printer i searched the internet for a solution only to find that others had encountered this and the solution was to purchase the a not very cost effective solution as this was not supposted to be a disposable model ||| 0

it was horrible soon as i plug the speakers in it was making a constant noise really annoying the speakers were junk worst purchase i 've ever made from amazon i would 've returned them but i did n't want to go through the trouble of sending it back so i just smashed them and went to best buy and got new ones i know it was a cheap speaker but hell it should atleast work properly talk about trash ||| 0
these speakers are unusable they give off horrible feedback even when there 's not a cell phone or cordless phone in the room ||| 0
this machine is great looking compact and seems to be the perfect combination one major problem the phone is well below average in sound quality and the speaker is absolutely terrible the tiny poorly made speaker is placed in the back left side of the unit and and is totaly inaudible at loud volumes due to distortion the fax is great the print quality is great the speed is great but you have to lower the volume and lean over with your head against the speaker to hear messages this problem also renders the speakerphone useless i returned this unit twice thinking it was defective but spoke to hp and was told that is just the way this unit works buy the panasonic if you need a great sounding unit the only problem with the panasonic is that it does n't come in black but is a much better ||| 0

this card is on its way back to amazon i purchased it as it was one of the recommended items '' with the camera i also purchased never mind that it does n't work with the camera i 'm not hugely tech savvy i wrongly assumed that any items recommended with the main item a 500 camera would be compatible check to make sure that any recommended accessories will actually achieve what you want them to ||| 0
this is n't the type of behavior i would expect from such a valuable and big company as amazon is they cancelled my order same way as the other people 's they did n't even send any notification email and i found my order cancelled by looking at the site amazon must learn that this is illegal and they must ship all the orders placed if they made a mistake pricing the item is their problem not ours and more after many customers confirmed the price over telephone if amazon do n't ship the orders already placed they will throw stones over their own roof and make lots of bad publicity i 'm one of many who wo n't be buying anything ever if amazon do n't send me my ordered items count with me for any legal actions that may be taken ||| 0
i bought these because i have an hp printer and figured they would be best for the shirts i want to make i could n't get them to take for anything in the world i put the pressure on it ironed them longer everything you can think of and they still would n't take then when i finally got one to take it completely cracked and crumbled and started peeling off before an hour was up it never made it to the wash so now i am out the money i paid for them and still have no shirts any other brands you suggest instead ||| 0

it states in the technical details that you can get 450 pictures from this cartridge this is not true after much discussion with hp they finally admitted that it 's only rated for 150 4 x 6 pictures my experience is that you actually get a little under 100 pictures from it if you 're buying this cartridge you 've probably already bought the printer but you should know before you buy the printer that you 're going to go through a lot of expensive ink ||| 0

this lexar brand has had issues with it 's memory cards i lost lots of pictures from a vacation to disney world and a convention their site had software that was to help recover some of those lost images ! ! i have never had flash memory trouble until lexar ! i now only buy scandisk items samsung invented this tecnology and sd is their product the store i bought the lexar chip was in a hurry to give me another chip i could trust he gave me the higher costing sd chip i was n't the first to have issues from buying it in his store he took a 50.00 loss to make me happy people take lots of photos now that we went digital imagine looking for some pictures you know you took and they are not there ! most think they messed up with this chip you will have that happen so pay very close attention most of what is lost can not be recovered pay the extra money for scandisk ||| 0
the remote control is but the earbuds are horrible ! they are very sensitive to your particular ear anatomy '' i suppose they fit for some people but for me they are useless they stay in for a few seconds but do n't dare do anything like running walking or moving your head and expect them to stay in much better to get lightweight headphones with an or band or even the models with hooks '' that fit over the top of your ears ||| 0
a short review do n't buy this product the wire is too long and the remote control is too heavy for the jack to hold after a month of the remote and wire hanging and swinging about the wire where it 's connected at the jack gave out making this remote unuseable i have to jiggle and find the sweet spot now just to make the remote work long wires plus a remote adds considerable stress and weight on the jack a serious design flaw if you want to buy this i suggest you tie the wire and the remote using a rubber band around your ipod to support it 's weight without pulling the wire off the connector ||| 0
i am sorry to say that my experience with the cd player has been miserable after a series of unhelpful conversations with sony folks i am going to return it it often fails to read the cd or cuts in and out on new cds that play perfectly in other cd players the shuffle program simply spins and spins and rarely settles down to actually play a cd it occasionally generates a read error message uh yeah even if on continuous '' play it often fails to recognize the cds loaded into it instead it displays a no disc '' message then even if it does play a series of cds on continuous play at some pt it just stops it has been like this since i first brought it home and has not improved in the weeks since the experience with the tech support people alone convinced me that they do not care it took a long time to even get through their tech support lines the first night i had it and then a lot of persuading to even get them to agree that their cd player was not working then they tried to convince to me send the brand new machine back a to have them repair it uh no not likely to fall for that paying them to repair a brand new machine straight out of the box taking time out of my life to ship it to them i finally have a reference number with permission to return it to the store for a full refund so back it goes then there are the limitations on the remote control that others here have noted since i had the same shuffle problems with my previous sony carousel player i am not inclined to try a machine needless to say no more sonys are coming into my life ||| 0
i mainly chose this mouse because i needed one quickly and it was black and matched my set up i had been using the standard greyish white optical mouse with a scroll wheel and a red light that shined out from under my wrist this one feels smaller but still comfortable however a couple weeks of normal usage made the mouse much less solid feeling the plastic now mushes as the seems flex slightly in my hand i decided to have a friend repair the cable of my old mouse i am going to donate this mouse to a friend who still has a tracking ball mouse i like some of logitechs products and higher end mice but i would stay away from this mouse its not bad its just not good enough to pick over other mice that cost the same amount hope that helps awesomefun ||| 0

this may be one of the cheapest routers out there but it 's cheap in every way i spent hours either on hold or talking with poorly trained overseas tech support '' whose expertise consisted of barely reading a script eventually these computer whizzes determined that my router did n't work they told me to send it back on my nickel of course and they sent me another one which also did not work at least not with my computer system after more wasted hours i was referred to the one guy at who supposedly has mastered this router 's bugs the problem he never answered the phone and despite all my calls to him and all my voicemails asking him either to call me at work or to set a time for us to talk he repeatedly returned my calls at in the afternoon the time when most people who can afford routers are working finally i had an epiphany life was too short to with i packed up the router and sent it back to the ceo stephen joe with a letter then i went out and bought a netgear router and i was up and running in minutes joe never responded to my letter but what else do you expect from a company that so clearly does n't value its customers ||| 0
have had this router for over a year during this time the router constantly lost the internet connection even when it 's wired directly to my desktop pc the disconnect can last anywhere from a couple of seconds to minutes a new firmware 1.23 was released a few days ago for revision a the version of the router i have 's website said the firmware improved reliability '' so i decided to upgrade after flashing to the new firmware the router will not let me into the control panel or respond to pings the lights blink that 's all i 've reset the router but this does nothing to restore the old firmware 's firmware upgrade appears to have put this router out of its misery which is perhaps for the best as it now forces me to finally go back to a reliable router company ||| 0

i spoke with customer service rep at devices have a warranty i stated that i sent in the registration card and asked if she would look up the purchase date she said no registration and warrany are in different departments '' she asked me to hold and came back on the line stating that since this model originally sold in 2003 my unit went off warranty in 2004 unless i have the invoice i called back about an hour later after finding the invoice and got the same customer service she recognized me and belittled me for calling back and said unless i have a question there 's nothing they can do i stated that i found the invoice as requested and she asked me to fax it to her i did that so far no response we 'll see if they replace the unit or not just an fyi after the warranty there are no options the do not offer parts or service after the warranty ||| 0

i bought this unit to use with a boombox and it functioned well but after a few minutes it just went blank i tried batteries in the boombox ac power and two boomboxes because they thought the boombox was the problem but after two boomboxes i guess the problem is the roady anyone else have this problem i use the xm only at home with the boombox currently waiting for response from crutchfield and delphi i will post again when if this is resolved ||| 0
this review is more about my several month 's experience with xm satellite radio and the quality using the wireless fm frequencies through our car 's radios i live in los angeles i got this little roady xt for me and the radio receiver for my wife i was excited about getting these new satellite receivers in our cars the idea of having all these no ads '' radio stations playing through my car 's fm frequency seemed cool setting up the unit and getting it to work was easy changing fm frequencies for the wireless transmitter is easy as well it really is a neat little receiver however after setting up this unit in my car and the in my wife 's car i was really disappointed in the music sound quality the music sounds flat and with a hissy quality almost monaural at times and the volume seems a lot lower than the car 's radio at the same volume setting i had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio the car 's regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers imo besides there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on xm radio as someone mentioned in another review i thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and i would n't have to use the poor sounding wireless fm technology but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and i did n't want the vehicle 's factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car 's dash and accidentally messed something up so about two month 's ago after several months of use of xm radio service i called to cancel my subscriptions i had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when i joined as i expected would happen when i called them to cancel i was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service finally i got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so i could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their special '' customer service department for cancellations where i was accidentally '' disconnected and had to call back and start all over again finally after another long call to them i was able to cancel my service so i thought yesterday i was looking at my september credit card bill and saw that xm radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed i called my bank and had them reverse the charges and i may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case xm tries to charge me again six months from now ||| 0

i 've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now the last few times i 've taken them out for vacation use in camera i 've had the same problem i charge two sets one kodak and one these energizers when i put the camera away a few weeks later i go off on vacation the kodak set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before the energizer set might last me half a day having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use after missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries i 'd had enough the energizers are going in the bin and i just followed the good reviews to buy a set of duracells to replace them ||| 0
i got these batteries just over a few months ago for my portable gps unit that i use often on my travels in fact i bought eight of them two packs of 4 i was upgrading from my previous set of rayovac nimh aa batteries that were still going strong after 2 years when i saw the new energizer rechargeables i was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old rayovacs boy was i wrong ! for months the energizers worked well a charge lasted about hours in my portable gps unit i was getting roughly hours on my old rayovac aa 's my gps unit is spec'ed for 6 hours on a pair of aa 's so the new energizers seemed to work flawlessly now they work okay and seem to be getting worse each time i charge them appearing to hold less of a charge each time for the last month or two month after their initial purchase i 'll be lucky if i can get hours of use out of them in my portable gps unit i now get roughly hours of use out of them i pulled out and tried my old rayovac aa 's and once again got approximately hours of use out of them in my gps unit and my trusty rayovacs are just over 2 years old ! i thought i might have had some defective energizers but i ca n't seem to get any pair of combinations to hold a decent charge charges just do n't seem to last it 's really disappointing i am going to look at another brand for high capacity mah nimh batteries to replace my rayovacs would be great if the energizer could hold its charge but because they do n't i do not recommend the energizers to anyone ||| 0
i bought several packs of these batteries 6 months ago they were great at first but now most of them wo n't hold a charge at all they discharge in 2 weeks without even being in a device do n't buy them ! they 're junk ||| 0
i had such high hopes for these headphones i wanted to hook them over my ears and go running whenever i pleased but it was not to be the day after i received my headphones my grandmother passed away i packed my bags put my idpod and headphones in my and headed to the airport once settled in my seat i tried to put on my headphones but they kept falling off my ears i tried to adjust them bending the earclips all sorts of ways but it was extremely difficult to do so and my adjustments would n't hold if i could n't get these headphones to stay on when i was stationary running was out of the question maybe others have had better luck maybe my ears are just too small for them but i am not impressed with these headphones ||| 0
you would think that panasonic cordless phone and panasonic headset would work well together being that they are sold by the same company well that is clearly not the case i bought this headset specifically for the reason that it is sold by panasonic to work with their cordless phones i 've tried it a few times and each time i get the same response from the person i 'm talking to they say i sound too far away that they can barely hear me this product is clearly not worth it ||| 0
i like the hp 96 because it can be used in many hp printers that use the hp 98 but its a better deal than the hp 98 because it contains almost twice as much ink hp 's ink cartridges provide excellent performance but i think they are over priced ||| 0

terrible product i have tried using the windows xp wireless application with just the netgear drivers and tried using the netgear wireless application with the netgear drivers using either one the card disconnects at random using wpa then you have to repair the connection and sometimes reboot to get the connection back i reinstalled windows both times i changed drivers just to make sure nothing was conflicting with it but nothing helped latest drivers are and were published in nov 2004 so netgear has moved on to other cards and is not supporting this one any longer ||| 0
these are extremely uncomfortable it 's too tight and will hurt the ears however if you 're head is small enough perhaps it might be okay on the bright side they sound extremely well ||| 0
do not get these headphones as they are way too tight i have been using them for a month now hoping they would break in more but they have not you can only have them on for 20 minutes or so before your ears hurt so bad you have to take them im not sure why they made them so tight but they would probably best fit a 10 year old ||| 0
i bought the zboard and was sorely disappointed in it 's playbility efficiency and value for several reasons left buttons which are the feature of the keyboard are based on a mirroring system you experience keyboard lag at times because the board has to interpret the button presses based on the zboard program then the game i personally had to press some buttons twice or even three times in order for that command to register left buttons can not be configured to your game you must configure the game to it the templates for different games can not be modified all it does is change the button configuration there are no patches for configuring the keys to how you want it to the website the top buttons for media can only be used with windows media player if you use winamp itunes or anything else it wont work can not program any macros into any of the buttons if you are looking for a keyboard that can autofire or program keystrokes this is n't it the numpad is configured differently than a normal keyboard this can actually be a good thing if you like having a compacted pad i found it frustrating since i put attack commands on the numbers and would press the wrong one sometimes because of the layout i experienced a lot of frustration with this controller while pvping in world of warcraft the top buttons on the left side of the board give you access to a bigger arsenal of spells and abilities when programmed right the problem is remembering how zboard configured the button layout i would constantly get wailed on because a button was n't where i originally remembered it to be this forced me to sit in the key bindings menu to configure the buttons to where i could remember after completely revamping my bindings i gave up restored my defaults and used a regular keyboard instead there is nothing gaming enhancing about this keyboard beyond having an accessory on the left side that looks cool because the buttons are grey and red and contoured to your hand to achieve the same effect as the zboard turn your current keyboard slightly to the right and enjoy ||| 0
i picked these speakers up because the price was right and they sounded great in the store but i get them home to my quiet house and lo and behold the subwoofer constantly hums i 'm not an audiophile and therefore not overly particular about sound other than this annoying hum from the subwoofer since these are set up in my home office where i spend a lot of time reading i find this humming far too distracting although the price is good i 'd prefer to pay a little more just to omit the subwoofer 's constant hum i 'm returning these speakers today and will shop around for another set ||| 0
can not get this thing to connect to my linksys wireless router problem is not that it does n't see the linksys the problem is that the firmware in the is if i try to enter a hex key for wep encryption it says i have to enter a value this is the one i bought i returned the first piece of junk and support from the manufacturer ||| 0
one star is too many ! it should be negative one this sad excuse for a has to be the worst piece of lame crud i have ever bought in my entire life picture fades into black terrible reception which fades in and out as you move about the room smells like burning plastic after a and so on please amazon shoppers do n't waste any money on this ! you might just as well throw the 15 out the window step up to something more reliable from a better manufacturer ||| 0
i love bringing my ipod to parties and broadcasting it through the stereo what use is this thing then none ! thanks for making us spend so much money apple this type of stuff should be built into the ipod for 400 ! ! ||| 0
i purchased this armband to hold my nano during workouts the band barely fits my arm and tends to slide down the arm while running or cross training looking for a replacement right now ||| 0
i adore my nano but this armband is one of the worst products i have ever bought i work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout the spacing of the velcro dots means i never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime i do weight lifting close to my body it is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is i am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage ||| 0

do not be fooled when the description says this stand holds up to 21 '' monitors that is only true for monitors not traditional crt monitors note that the weight rating says 50 pounds ! most standard 19 '' monitors weigh 60 pounds or more i purchased this item at a staples near me and brought it home to use with my 19 '' crt after placing the monitor on the stand the stand bobbed up and down and seemed as if it would completely bend at any moment ||| 0

amazon says that it is in stock do not believe it i ordered it at and they could not even ship it at they delayed it several times saying that it is in stock of course the website says that it is always in stock '' and can ship it now maybe their now is like 3 months my current keyboard has broken keys and i have serious inconvenience because of this ||| 0
while certain labels with this software are much more easier to work with such as the cds and the general labels i found this product much less than satisfactory the inserts and the software do n't align too well and are a few centimeters off especially on the lower half of the page if one wants to keep the insert regardless of whether or not the cut offs '' are present it would be best if the paper was inserted within the opposite position in the paper tray in the printer so one can cut to the size needed otherwise i would suggest what another amazon customer has done use cardstock paper least for the back inserts and trim with either a scissors or paper cutter a product should do what it promises it will do unfortunately this one does not at least within my experiance this does not measure up to what was previewed within the memorex beginner 's package cd label stamper two stars for at least being able to print the front side although it would have been nice if they had said so without stating they could do both when they can not ||| 0
i have used these labels for a long time mostly because they seem to be the only ones out there the paperstock is good but if you have a good printer the paper wo n't do it justice the labels always end up looking kinda cheap i would love to see memorex make a package with glossy end paper maybe epson will beat them to it ||| 0
i really love my garim gps 12. it is easy to use and move between screens and features the summit is not as easy to use it is not as convenient to identify way points does not work with mapping software and its display is to simple it was not a step up but sideways i use it in conjunction with my gps 12 mostly just to keep the track log ||| 0
i bought this monitor in june 2006 and at first was quite pleased with the nice display less than 6 months later in november 2006 i heard a strange noise while using the monitor and all of the sudden the screen went very bright like an overexposed photo i 'm currently working with viewsonic to get it repaired i must mail it to ca to be repaired postage must be paid by me all in all a disappointment and a hassle next time i 'll buy a name brand ||| 0
i bought these cables brought them home and immediatly hooked them up i set the for component and set my tv for it as well and it looked awesome about 2 weeks then the short in the cables caused only the blue and green colors to work making everything look creepy it would just fade back and forth until it just stop and the tv would have all the colors washed out in green i found that i could stick a case under the cables at the base and it went away but sometimes someone would move the case and it would come back i have the pstwo small version and the the small version has the problem but the large one doesnt so dont get them if you have the small version the large one works fine ||| 0
i logged 870 miles with the iway 350 270 miles around maryland it was is a great item i took it on our first trip to new york and long island and it was terrible the first problem occurred on the new jersey turnpike i was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat the unit said i was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway however when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more it said i was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70 and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere i even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job it did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 miles from when it acted up we even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again about 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going we often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit then on the trip from the bronx to long island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating i had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone however about 1 mile from their place it started working again we used it on long island with no trouble at all then on trip back to the bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions then on our way back from the bronx to long island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating the same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the bronx on our way back to maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions i did update the software to the new days before we took the trip also charting the 212 mile course to the bronx ny took close to 20 minutes then the extra destination to long island a 30 mile addition took the iway 350 30 or so more minutes i figured with all that time the trip home calculations would be faster but i fell asleep after waiting over a hour for it to complete the task i feel this is one issue the unit has longer trips take so long to calculate so when it thinks your off track it takes forever to chart a new course on short runs under 20 miles it was very fast i returned the unit and got a garmin the is a very nice unit fast in every respect ||| 0
the is well packaged with almost current programming it only got me lost eleven 11 times on a 865 mile trip all cities in georgia tybee island to pine mountain to newnan to stone mountain and return to tybee island i packed and returned the unit the day after getting home it may suit others well but i can not rely on the unit four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences one wrong turn took me sixty miles out of the way two were for unknown reasons the unit seems to take forever to acquire available satellites instructions are clear but preferred views automatically switch to map '' even when not wanted i need a faster reacting unit that allows programming while enroute to a destination by a passanger of course ||| 0
i bought this unit on a wim i was leaving for a business trip and needed a gps i really like it and it worked well for me unfortunalty the unit would n't hold a charge on the battery so i returned it for another one it worked for one week and then i had the same exact problem which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units when i tried to return this unit the unit i was given did n't work at all it gave me an error message when the gps booted up unfortunaltey the vendor i purchased it from did n't have any more units that i could exchange it for so i called customer service and got an ran i am hoping when i get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that i do n't have any more problems ||| 0
i received the ipod quickly which was a plus but it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs i had friends who have the same ipod try to fix it and it never worked i sent it back and requested a refund it has been a month and a half and i have yet to get my 120 back ||| 0
i bought this since it 's economical compact did n't need cabling although it has an extension if you need it advertised a whopping 108 mbps well so much for that 1 drivers are problematic and causes conflicts with xp my first ever blue screen of death in about 3 or more years running xp came this item 2 it is extremely unreliable already mentioned repeatedly it overheats it drops connections randomly and yes the only way to the signal is to unplug and plug back in it 's utility is worthless just install the driver if you can if you try using wpa forget about using this utility just use windows to configure it i 've also found out that it 's better if you just remove this utility from the startup do n't run it at all so that windows can do everything it needs to connect which is faster and more reliable be careful not to uninstall since it will also remove the driver just remove it from your windows startup folder list netgear has an faq about this problem but i 'm not going to tweak windows and risk more stuff for this cheap piece of hardware 3 108 mbps yeah right you 'll need the right kind of access router for this if not it 's 54 mbps this was one of the selling points but it 's definitely a gotcha '' you 're limited to specfic equipment specific channel 6 so if you have neighbors on the same channel well you get the picture ||| 0
all hdmi cables are created equal well yes and no while the signal is 100 digital which means that 20 150 cables give the exact same picture quality it does n't mean that each hdmi cable type gives the same rejection of noise signal to noise ratio as other hdmi cables i 've had this cable a few weeks now and am consistently getting digital dropouts '' every now and again only that part of the image looks scrambled for a few seconds very annoying while the action is in the scrambled section went out and bought the monster hdmi cable not exactly cheap though the monster cable gives the exact same picture quality as this cable except the monster cable did not experience the digital dropouts '' if you do n't mind seeing the dropouts every now and again this is a great cable if you want a picture that does n't experience any dropouts get the monster cable regardless the picture quality is the exact same between the cables minus the dropouts ||| 0

the dvd burner connected very easily through usb was immediately recognized by winxp the software installation was fine i was beginning to feel good however whenever i burned a dvd i tried 4 different brands some r some rw etc several files would contain errors and would be completely unreadable the burning process moreover does not detect this one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors moreover the firmware update just does not work on my machine pardon machines completely standard dell machines all latest winxp and drivers good cpus and up lots of memory big i called customer service to try to solve the problem first of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes the rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing to make a long story short i had to call 3 times first guy oh of course it does n't work you have easycd creator installed ! '' ok i buy it i go through the painful uninstallation process of roxio 's software no problems solved second guy oh of course it does not work it requires of free space ! it 's written on the box '' plain lie on the box it says you need for nerovision for burning videos but only for nero quarrel they are tough ! with the guy who could not care less about the fact i got him lying or that the product description is wrong ok patiently i freed up from hard drive try again exactly same problem the only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement i got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720 not a 710 since 710 is not manufactured anymore wonder why notice i tried this on two different machines one laptop and one desktop with identical results other lie i noticed as somebody else here that the nero software provided writes only on sony drives so if nero is really the only software that should be installed because of conflicts with roxio et you will never be able to use your own cd drive to burn cds how ridicolous is that the technician said this is because i had both software s installed but that was another lie the incompetence of these guys is beyond belief if the new drive will not work i hopefully will get a refund through my credit card you know the technician even said that that is not possible credit cards companies do not do that lol ||| 0
i am on my third drive now thanks to the first two breaking sony sent me the as a replacement for my but it 's the same drive with the exception of some faster burn times and the does n't support mac os the sony service center in manning ia gave me a huge runaround first they agreed to pay for return shipping on the second defective drive then they called me back 2 hours later and refused to pay for the shipping what a joke good drive when it works but may god have mercy on you if it breaks after the return period ||| 0

i had this adapter running in my the cardbus slot of my windows 98 computer and it ran fine i installed it on my windows 2000 laptop well my first sign of trouble was a warning popup when i installed the drivers that the drivers were not certified by microsoft so imagine my shock when my brand new computer constantly got blue screen of death bsod crashes big blue screen loss of data computer freezes tight power button inoperative and when you have to use a pin to press that tiny little laptop reset button on a brand new computer well we all know that 's when you 're in computer hell i 'm a microsoft certified professional so i was able to narrow down the source of the problem after definitely identifying the as the culprit i contacted netgear 's online tech support and that 's when things really started to get ugly it took forever for netgear to finally give me an answer this was after days of inactivity wildly inappropriate responses and repeatedly requesting same information from me finally netgear escalated the problem to their next level of tech support and i was shocked to read their solution this is a windows issue regarding permissions and compatibility mode '' while they were vague as to the exact nature of the problem and contradicted themselves as to whether compatibility mode had to be enabled or disabled their solution was straightforward i was directed to a microsoft knowledge base article which tells you how to enable compatibility mode and for compatibility mode i had to make my nice clean windows 2000 computer compatible with windows 95 yes so while the hardware is a cardbus adapter apparently their drivers are ! ! ! no wonder the was never certified for windows 2000. and i would n't trust it for windows xp either there are other ethernet adapters out there by belkin linksys smc and xircom that work flawlessly with windows by companies that will respond to your questions go get them avoid the ||| 0
no way am i purchasing this for my ipod i would love to be able to charge my ipod away from my imac but i refuse to purchase this this should of been included in the box it is a tremendous ripoff to buy an ac adapter seprately and at 30 but then again i 'm sure apple is making a ton off of this gimic but i refuse to contribute i can see not including a dock cables etc as those are n't essential ipod accessories but an ac adapter come on bad apple bad ! on the plus side this ac adapter is smaller and comes with an ipod to charger or ipod to computer cable which the previous model did not include it 's still a ripoff though ||| 0
i have been a dvr user through cox cable for approx 1 yr and have always been disappointed i have kept my eye on tivo for some time and when my dvr box went out for the time i decided it was time to try tivo i got a refurbished dvr that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for 12.95 per month i received the tivo only 2 days after i ordered very impressive since i did n't pay to have it shipped that quickly the setup was reasonably straight forward i had heard so much about tivo that i had very high expectations and here are the problems i encountered that surprised me 1 my first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs dvr does this automatically so i ordered the wrong unit to be honest i do n't see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner my family relies on dual tuners a lot i am shocked that tivo even offers a single tuner system to me it 's like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed a dual tuner is so much more useful 2 i thought i would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network no you have to buy theirs for 40 to 50 since i did n't know that i had to rely on the phone line option this really stinks it is very very very slow i spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming the system kept getting interuppted during download yes i disabled call waiting 3 when you use the online program guide it covers up the entire screen my cox dvr puts the tv in upper right corner approx asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide we use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on but that wo n't work so well with tivo plus scrolling up and down is painfully slow the screen takes for ever to refresh 4 similarly to item 3 above when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely you can only see the tivo guide again cox dvr lets me look at my list and delete files all while my tv program stays visible in the upper right corner 5 remote would n't work with my 42 '' akai plasma i ca n't fault tivo too much on this one none of the universal remotes seem to work with this tv for some reason i did love some of the tivo features and wish my cox dvr had them 1 wishlist 2 tivo suggestions 3 can access your tivo through internet 4 view photo 's through tivo in the end my items 3 and 4 were things i just could n't get past so i returned my tivo they were friendly and helpful and i really wanted to like this product but in my opinion it 's not able to compete with the speed and power of the cable companies dvr ||| 0
i bought a lot of panasonic stuff in the past without any problems but the picture quality on this thing is awful even at the highest quality setting all i saw were blocky artifacts that seemed to be blinking i even had the dnr digital noise reduction enabled and it did n't help most recordings skipped and stuttered at the beginning i took it back for refund and best buy told me this model is known for doing that i do n't see how panasonic can put their name on this junk those cheap 99 recorders you find at walmart have better quality than this ||| 0
heaven help you if you want to use this with the fm remote a very common usage at heath clubs which provide tv rebroadcasts over fm the fm remote connects to the ipod via a large plug on the left hand side the armband provides a small circular hole on the right hand side but no means of connecting the large fm remote plug ||| 0

stay away from vonage ! i have had it for several months and have been trying to cancel it i have been put on hold a minumum of 45 minutes to and hour each time and then transferred to someone else who then does the bait and switch again when you go to their web site the only thing you can get is their custumer service number which takes you right back to the same old nonsense i need to cancel because of a military deployment and all i 'm getting is a run around the same thing happened with aol but this is even worse there are tons of blogs out now about how vonage sucks check them out it 's no wonder this company is tanking their customer service is the absolute worst ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i hope they read this they really need to change ! ! ||| 0

i initially chose this router because of its low price sometimes you get what you pay for and that is exactly what happened to me as a wired router this works well enough it connects four computers to the internet just do n't do anything to intense with it and you should be fine i noticed that when i view video media the connection totally freezes but for basic internet and downloading it works i generally find however that no one buys a wireless '' router not to use wireless and that is where the problem is the receiver is so painfully finicky it does not keep connections the configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery the linksys support team tries to be helpful but i ca n't seem to make this router reliable it drops reception all the time many times my laptop wo n't even detect a signal the wireless performance of this router is abysmal i sincerely hope that if you have this router it is working flawlessly for you i ca n't get it to work well for me not matter what i do the difficulty that i am having with this equipment is so bad that i am going to replace it as soon as i can ||| 0
i 've been using my for a few months now the little thing has its good points a nice unobtrusive little box i can just plug in and hide on top of some piece of office furniture allowing my rather household some nice convenient net access while still allowing the home office systems a wired connection sounds nice if it only worked howver has a major problem and a rather common one at that specifically it locks up it does so frequently i have to unplug the router at least once a day and frequently twice to deal with it locking up ca n't even access the administrator screen and even hitting the reset button is n't enough to fix it wireless is n't too useful when you have to physically walk to the unit multiple times a day is it the problem seems to lie not in the hardware but in the firmware the software that runs on the router if linksys would release reliable firmware for this router i 'd give it stars but until they resolve the issue that wires down their wireless modem i ca n't possibly justify giving the more then two stars ||| 0
i bought this router and spent almost two hours online with linksys after trying every sort of suggestion and speaking with three different tech support people who barely spoke english i finally understood that linksys has limited support for macs '' when i asked what limited support '' means i was told we are not trained to help people with a mac if you can borrow a windows pc we can help you '' what a waste of time i am sending the router back beware if you have a mac ||| 0
the first vista cx i purchased died after only 3 days of use i returned it to amazon who immediately and painlessly replaced it the second unit lasted for 4 days until i fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket though it was only submersed for a matter of seconds it immediately stopped working and water was seen internally around the screen garmin 's claim of waterproofness for for 10 minutes is utter baloney the poorly designed lock on the battery case can not possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity i probably would n't buy buy another garmin but i 'm stuck with them as i have already invested 200 in proprietary mapsource software i guess that was their plan on the plus side the vista cx did seem to function as it should for all of 7 days ||| 0
this is the best sounding pc speaker system available absolutley stellar sound quality for how long is a serious problem i too own 2 of these systems after eleven months of bliss my first amp also went out i call klipsch technical support and they explain i can send it in but the amp is backordered for weeks so i buy another one from amazon and thier retailer beach audio not having weeks to wait for bliss to return so get this please not 360 plus tax once but twice and add 2 occurances of overnight shipping at 125 per for a total spend of 970 plus tax ! ! ! well blow me down but the replacement for amp 1 hase n't even showed up and 6 working days of bliss later you guessed it amp 2 fails klipsch well they obviously picked quite a piece of crap for an amp they stand behind the product though i have another rma to send to the fine people at the klipsch return center the retailer this site uses beach audio offered me my money back but would offer no replacement of any sort and no refund for the 125 shipping charge nothing they wanted to do would help me get a working product they refered me to klipsch without mercy or even lube now klipsch makes some fine home audio my klipschhorns are 15 years old have been rocked to death and still sound awesome and this promedia ultra unit sounds fabulous so i may do business with them again perhaps not the pc multimedia division but i vow to never give another red cent to amazon 's retailer beach audio they were uncooperative unsympathetic curt short unprofessional and ultimately completely useless when contacted about the failure please look elswhere for your next pc multimedia purchase ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the klipsch promedia division should n't ever be considered ||| 0
the first subwoofer died no sound after 6 days remember the sub powers all the speakers in this system i sent it back to the company i bought it from and they were nice enough to take care of klipsch 's faulty product '' they asked me if i would like a refund and like an idiot i said no just send me another one '' the replacement klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then nothing no power from the sub ! same problem but now my warranty is up klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty shame on klipsch for making such a shoddy product shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice heed all these warnings my friends i would buy used speakers at a garage sale before i would buy another klipsh product you have been warned ! ||| 0
these speakers do sound great but just like many others who have reviewed these speakers they eventually just stop working it sounds like i was one of the lucky ones as mine lasted two years but i really did n't use them all that much and i do n't blast the volumes when you spend this kind of many on a product it should at least last 5 years or so i 've never had any other speaker brand just stop working on me before worse of all is to hear that klipsch is charging a lot of money to repair their faulty products and that people had problems with them even after they were repaired '' well i 'm not wasting time and money on repairing them i 'm just switching to logitech no more klipsch ever again for me ||| 0
i received the ipod quickly which was a plus but it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs i had friends who have the same ipod try to fix it and it never worked i sent it back and requested a refund it has been a month and a half and i have yet to get my 120 back ||| 0
i like other lacie drives i 've used very much thought i 'd take a chance on this but it just does not work it takes me about a hundred swipes on average to get the biometric sensor to work that is keeping data a bit too secure to be helpful also there have been reports of complete data loss by others but i 've not had that experience could be i just have n't been able to get to my data enough to find out support from lacie was completely unhelpful wash your hands and the sensor before swiping which i have already done dozens of times was the only suggestion if the drive could be partioned so you could have a secure partition and an easier to access partion the failure of biometrics would not be so serious but as is i would definitely not purchase this again and i would strongly advise against it unless there is some kind of firmware or other improvement ||| 0

you 'd think that a palm screen protector from palm would be best in class however these palm premium '' screen protectors have a lifespan of about days at best i 'm very careful with my new palm tx yet under normal use the stylus easily scratches the screen protector to such an extent that the device no longer accurately recognizes stylus input i also dislike having to cut the screen protectors to size i 've tried an invisible shield screen protector and it was tough as nails the problem was that installation was difficult and the tacky surface also produced input errors next i 'm trying a boxwave cleartouch i never had this sort of problem with the old fellowes writeright protector which lasted a year or more on my old palm ||| 0
monster cable and its similarly overpriced imitators are a triumph of hype over substance and ruthlessly exploits the consumer 's naivete and trust in shady salespeople yes for most things you do get what you pay for '' when it comes to speaker cables interconnects and other wiring however it 's another story all you need for optimal sound is any 12 to 16 gauge generic cable which you can buy at home depot for a fraction of the cost save your money for things like speaker stands which really do make a world of difference ||| 0

when i plugged these in they worked fine for about seven minutes then the speaker 's internal power simply cut off happened on the ac adapter or batteries whether i was using my computer or my ipod as the sound source same behavior every time logitech sent me a replacement from a new production run same thing happened sent it back to logitech on my nickel got another replacement from same production run product id same problem after two months and many long waits for logitech tech support i 'm giving up maybe it was just a bad run or maybe my environment is flukey but i 'm sorry i ever bought this thing ||| 0
the koss headphones are quality headphones but sounds weak when driven through a regular headphone jack from your receiver or tv to get the great sounds that everyone else seems to rave about you really need to run these headphones through a headphone amp also the ear pads are of a material which does n't breathe well making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods i 've read that leatherette pads are available but so far have n't been able to find them the warranty alone is great but i would n't recommend these headphones unless you have a headphone amp ||| 0

i had one that worked for a year that came with the original phone then i just ordered this one from amazon and it worked for 30 days like other reviews you see here people started not being able to hear me but i could hear them so the microphone broke but i called uniden tech support and they recommended i replace the battery on the phone for 37 so i just ordered a new phone and tested the headset sure enough it was n't the phone it was the headset a costly mistake i would not buy this headset again also amazon has a 30 day return policy so if it breaks make sure you return it within that 30 days or you are stuck with it ||| 0

it was an okay mousepad for approximately a year and a half every so often my optical mouse jittered from one edge of the screen to the other when left stationary but i encountered no serious problems unfortunately it seems that might have been indicative of a greater problem with the mousepad it is all one color the grooves have all worn away on a large portion of the pad and now my mouse wo n't budge i 'm in the process of looking for an alternative right now ||| 0
i do n't like how easy it get scratch and if u get the black one even worst i went shopping for cases but they get scratch inside the cases too just by been in the case i return the case then i when for those clear stickers and i recomend to put those on on a really clean table and very dry and clean hands may be use glove cause a little touch and there goes your finger print in the sticker and with a black ipod you ca n't miss it and if u do n't take your time u will have a lot of air bubbles showing in your ipod so after a week looks like something that i have for a year it sucks ||| 0
the netgear wireless router product is apparently in working order because i mailed it to my son in tennessee who got it to work just fine on his equipment which is the same as mine surely i 'm not so technically savvy as my son but i can read and write and follow directions the setting up of the equipment is quite complicated in my view far moreso than it should be i 've set up other peripherals with success but this product is more than i can handle i 've followed the directions over and over and still the router does n't connect i 've given up ca n't handle the frustration by the way i 'm way over the age of 13. i have grandchildren over the age of 13 ||| 0
after a bit of sweat i 've managed to get the printer working fine from both my xp and mac os tiger computers until i unplug the direct ethernet cable to the router that is needed for then nothing happens no wireless printing i suspect it 's an ip addressing issue having read a helpful article here take note amazon is becoming a better support site than your own ! changing the ip address messes up my internet connection during install the mac works quite hard to the internet connection perhaps this breaks the connection to the printer i dunno but it 's giving me a headache documentation troublshooting help are very very weak time will tell if support are any better 22 hours no response from them yet i 'm sure network wizards will have this little beasty up running in no time but for normal people it 's well a bit of a pain ||| 0
i contacted support and they verified that this product was tested and worked with a very minimum number of popular usb printers i believe the number was around the wireless print server did not work with any of the 3 usb printers i owned lexmark hp psc 1250 hp photosmart 7310 it worked okay with my one parallel hp laserjet 1100 and i was able to connect it to my network and install the print server but it was not at all compatible with my printers which was key it this product was more compatible i would have rated it 4 stars because the installation was very easy and almost plus it was very sensitive to the wireless radio waves it sensed my secured wireless network when other print server could not in that same location i returned the and bought instead a linksys print server that worked with all of my printers but it was not as sensitive as the so i had to move my printers and print server closer to my wireless access point ||| 0
several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite audio video cable or an plug almost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the tv uses different internal circuitry for each one virtually any cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable and any component individual video connection will be better than cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it there may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another but its almost always unnoticable ||| 0

you may notice i am writing this in lowercase i am using the keyboard i bought over a year ago the shift keys suddenly went out so the keyboard is now useless i have to subtract for longevity the mouse that comes with the keyboard is poor but i use it with another mouse anyway and as noted in other reviews this in common with most other usb keyboards only works with basic functionality when hooked up through a usb kvm switch on the good side the battery life is very good and i think it looks nice but i 'll be looking for something else for a ||| 0
after seeing a wide range in the prices for hdmi cables i did some research into why is it found out that these cables carry digital signals 0 's and 1 's so no matter what kind of fancy name you add before this cable its basic purpose is simple like a cable then i went ahead and bought the cheaper ones which are working perfectly fine so dont be fooled by the high price cables there is no special sheilding in them its all misleading marketing for this length of cable i would pay maybe 5 ||| 0
from reading the reviews the product weighs 14 oz and is tiny from reading amazon 's specs 12.0 x 14.0 x 10.0 inches 4.0 pound ||| 0
do not be deceived by the photo this thing is tiny if that is what you are looking very small low volume very portable i suppose it is ok but over price for what you get i think 30.00 would have been about right there is no bass response and for there size how could there be i am keeping them but only because they are so small they might come in handy for hotel use only ! the packaging is very cool but the fidelity is non existent ||| 0

i really enjoyed my zen when it worked the first one i ordered i had to return becuase it would only play every other song and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and i would have to take out the battery to make it stop so i exchanged it for a new one and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again it would freeze up and would only play 5 seconds of every song what i liked about it for the small amount of time i had it was the sound quality the choice in colors and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space i 'm not sure i would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days now i have an iriver clix and have had no problems it has less storage but i do n't care it is easier to control and i have n't had problems with it ||| 0

we 'll give the unit two stars instead of one since when it does work it works well with nice but in a span of years its has needed its drum replaced three times and has once needed the main board replaced we 'd purchased this back when it cost about 125 more than it does now and the parts have not been quickly available from some vendors we should have bought the brother 4750 which we use in another office and has been flawless ||| 0

the memorex has got to be one of the worst 's out in the market not only is the rate of a successful dvd burn very low movies games etc it also has a horrible shelf life that lasts for about four months from what i hear from other members memorex uses a dye and is explicitly evident in the red colored deterioration of the dye that can be seen on the top layer of the disk all my 's are actually stained red for some reason ! overall go with verbatim or heck even compusa dvd 's will be more suffice than this garbage ||| 0
i got this at a black friday sale and i was absolutly thrilled with it until the end broke off the end where the battery was broke off one day and would n't stay on i now have to hold it in place with rubber bands now the player will constantly shut off whenever it moves the slightest bit the radio however before it broke was great the organization of the files was good and the mic worked okay if you talked straight into it overall this was okay for the money i paid for it but i would n't recommend this to anyone ||| 0
be aware before you buy this flash drive that it will not accept file names with many commonly used characters like ' ' and ' when it encounters these characters it stops transferring files completely and you have to begin the copying process again after 'correcting ' the file names for me this was a serious inconvenience and an undisclosed liability of the device for others it may be less important ||| 0

this printer binds up on two pieces of paper ! if there is the least resistance during a jam the flimsy plastic gears become stripped and the printer is trash this is what happened to me after less than two months of light use and i stayed within the manufacturer 's guidelines however there is no warrantee on this printer so buyer beware ||| 0
happy with the three tips included i decided to try these for the heck of it while they go nicely and comfortably deep into the ear and do n't dare come out until you intend for them to for some reason they diminish the quality of the sound greatly i can most closely describe it as the sound of overcompressed they took nearly all of the clarity out of the music ||| 0

i recently bought this keyboard to go along with a fancy ergonomic laptop stand the stand puts the laptop screen at a reasonable height for use on a desktop that works great the keyboard however is fairly awful and i 'm returning it i realize i should n't expect much for 20 but the keyboard has an exceptionally soft mushy feeling the comfort type '' slanted keys did n't get in my way but they did n't help anything either the worst part about this keyboard however was that it uses a layout look closely at the right side the enter '' key is oversized and the key is moved below to accomodate it with the consequence that the right shift key is miniaturized this for a shell user or programmer is awful when you need to pipe something or escape the next character you really do n't mean to be hitting return instead and with the small right shift key even typing properly with balanced use of the keyboard is difficult this small design decision makes this keyboard terrible for heavy computer users like me ||| 0

i bought this item about two months ago and was happy as can be no more equipment in the tv room ! about two weeks ago though i noticed that the unit was slower and slower and i had to hit buttons repeatedly to get things done it has eventually gotten to the point that it does not work at all at first i thought it was batteries in the remote so i replaced those a few times then i thought the placement of the ir transmitter was off so i moved it closer to my av rack that worked at first but the problem persisted so i reprogrammed but to no avail eventually i narrowed it down to the remote unit even with the remote right next to the ir transmitter it now does not work most of the time of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room so standard ir remotes why do they even make those still are out of the question i will be moving onto something else and keep my fingers crossed along the way i learned a few other things other reviewers are right in that the memory gets eaten up quickly when you have to program the unit which i do with a new lg dvd player in theory this is a great unit and the remote is very good when it comes to commands in practice however all it did was make me hungry for an rf system that will work more consistently ||| 0
the ge superadio iii used to be a great radio i bought my first one seven years ago and it worked so well that i bought another i have recently purchased two more as gifts and they are not the same radio they look the same except for the numbers on the tuning dial inside they have dissimilar circuit boards the real difference is the two new radios are unable to tune stations nearly as well as the older radios i would recommend not purchasing this radio ||| 0

ca n't say much for the video or sound quality menu options or anything really since this thing broke after 2 minutes of watching monsters on dvd playback just froze the thing stopped recognizing that dvds were in unless you turned the thing off and then back on again and after another minute it would n't even start playing the thing at all just whirred a lot so dud ||| 0

my player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had which ended up rendering it useless out of warranty however while it worked i was quite pleased with the player and the included software everything was intutive and ran smoothly except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden i also liked the fact that this player was n't bound by itunes or file format restrictions my only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult just give me buttons i know they are n't sexy but they 're easy and work well i am giving the product 2 stars because while i liked it creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build being that this is still a problem with these players for the amount of money that a player like this costs it should work for at least year ||| 0
this music player was decent nice look controls and sound there are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive there are really good things about this unit however the faults are just too great thus superseding the great features however the reaction to your key pushes and file search are way too slow the software is pretty nice but the bad thing is that it likes to rename your files for you even when you did n't ask it too that gets very annoying for example i just want the file to be named as is with no tags but the zen software will add tags no matter what even if it has to put in the word unknown '' it also has these strange crashes that makes it hard to have it recover the worst part about this product is that the earphone jack gets damaged in a few weeks or months unprovoked ! it was so frustrating to think my headphones where damaged but i switched it up and found out that it was the zen then i read online and what do you know it 's consensus the product is faulty because many other people have experienced the same problem some people even found some fixes and i 've tried them but to no avail but then again why do i have to fix a fairly new product if you 're going to have a fault when it comes to a music player you do n't want it to be a physical issue that renders the player useless ! i 'd give it at least three stars as i was quite satisfied with it but the physical fault with the headphone jack is just too much of negligence to overlook ||| 0
i purchased this product and ran home to try it out not 5 minutes after plugging it in to my computer my computer freezes i restart and it says my device is malfunctioning i manage to get it working for about 5 minutes before it craps out on me again i try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network i 'm a network engineer and i am well versed in what i am doing but this card has given me nothing but trouble i had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect this only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing i talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor is n't supported which is total bs and just an attempt to get out of supporting me they would n't even let me return the product my advice go with linksys or or smc anyone but netgear ||| 0
several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite audio video cable or an plug almost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the tv uses different internal circuitry for each one virtually any cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable and any component individual video connection will be better than cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it there may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another but its almost always unnoticable ||| 0
i bought this product less than a year ago 2 days ago i locked my laptop and tried to unlock it but i could n't it was somehow messed up and the combination did not work i had to cut it ! ! ! i do n't know how it got messed up but i 'm sure that it was not study enough to last long ||| 0

the first unit could n't even find fm stereo stations it had similar fm specs as the sony tuner it was replacing it was returned as a faulty unit the replacement strde 197 was able to find stereo fm stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo my 25 year old tuner did an excellent job on fm stereo stations the second unit was returned for a refund sony 's quality is n't what it use to be i bought an onkyo the fm works fine with more features expandability ||| 0
i bought this receiver from amazon received it about 10 days ago since then i 've tried to play my cassettes of classical music when used for this purpose this receiver sucks big time if i turn the volume loud enough to hear the orchestra playing softly when the orchestra gets loud the amp shuts down protect flashes on off i have to turn the receiver off then turn it back on lower the volume then of course when the music gets soft again i ca n't hear it ||| 0
i bought one of these it has a bad audio crackling '' noise on every mode except fm tuner an obvious defect sounds like a capacitor going bad not sure how it got through final test plus the audio has noise when the display updates or the volume is changed it also hangs on to stereo mode on weak signals with no blend or rolloff you hear audio tones from the stereo decoder pll losing lock from the station 19 khz pilot tone am section is not bad but the fm selectivity is not good enough to block alternate stations that most of my other radios deal with just fine volume steps are so small it takes forever to change needs a flippin ' crank on the knob do n't buy this steaming turd a china box then you can throw it away when it claps out without feeling like you got scammed ||| 0
after two months this phone stopped working it was returned to panasonic repair and we received a notice thirty days later saying that the phone was back ordered and delivery would be in weeks this is not customer service panasonic should have refunded the purchase price or offered a comparable or better phone when called today to check on status of order answer was basically tough luck '' never again panasonic amazon should discontinue this brand ||| 0
as others have reported my latch broke as well but i broke it within three days of ownership within a month i cracked the bit of plastic that is supposed to hold the palm in place when i was removing it from the case to sync it at the time the case had so many gashes and dings that it really looked unpresentable bought a rhinoskin to replace this look elsewhere before you purchase this one ||| 0
ok so it protects the tx on a fall however the latching mechanism depends on a thin piece of plastic that eventually breaks rendering the case without anyway of remaining shut on its own replacing this with something like the hardcase availab le from amazon ||| 0
i purchased the case along with my new palm tx to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it it 's a metal shell with a molded plastic liner the little plastic catch in the lid half which keeps the case closed never seemed to work quite correctly requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut on a trip on march this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away now it has no catch to keep it closed since the case cost me about 24 new and i 'd only get about half price for the return i figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return i 'll use a rubber band around the case reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is save your money and do n't buy this case i do n't remember reading the reviews before i ordered it so there 's a 24 lesson ||| 0
of the various ipod cases i 've tried i found this one to be the worst the click wheel cover is impractical and annoying and the screen cover falls out all too easily using plastic in rubber hinges was a bad idea which simply does not work well see my other reviews for better ipod protectors ||| 0
i was delighted with my toughskin for all of two hours that 's how long it took for the belt clip to break rendering my new purchase worthless to me the toughskin itself is rugged i loved it i should have waited before buying it though on my last visit to an apple dealership they had a bin full of the toughskins for sale at a discount when i asked about these i was told the belt clips break and customers bring the toughskins back '' i should note i 'm very careful with my ipod and accessories i 'm not rough on them the clip just fell apart while i was walking down the street given other comments about the flimsy clips this is clearly a design issue that speck products needs to address ||| 0
first off i bought this headset for gaming which anyone who enjoys the pastime will tell you how quickly the hours can melt away gamers are dependant on an ultra comfortable pair of headphones that we should n't be able to feel i have been searching high and low for the holy grail of comfort and i was certain paying for a gaming '' headset would be the end of my search sorry these guys are going back i 've tried a couple cheap '' headsets that i found painful to wear after an hour or so then i decided to spring for top of the line '' i wore these for 15 minutes before it became obvious this headset was not the holy grail i 've been looking for the headset itself feels flimsy and cheap the padding is made of an itchy fabric and even on my small head it feels tight the earphones do not cover my ears and i can feel them slowly being crushed i 'm not impressed with the sound but i could overlook that if they were comfortable to wear i did n't even bother to try the mic if this is how sennheiser makes their high end gaming equipment i think it 's safe to say i will avoid these guys in the future the 30 pair of aiwa 's i wear at work are more comfortable than this and sound the same if only that pair had a mic ears still feel uncomfortable after taking the set off and then writing this i could n't imagine wearing them for a few hours while gaming if i find the perfect pair i 'll let you all know ||| 0

i 've been a fan of sony earbuds for many years due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest sony earbuds i decided on purchasing these panasonic headphones i bought these headphones because my sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory creative zen micro headphones i found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs i 've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings it 's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise i like the around the neck feature as far as quality the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it as far as the performance of the headphones i 'm really disappointed in these headphones my factory creative headphones had out performed these the bass level is too low even when i max out the bass in the player the mids and treble sound like crap do n't waste your money on these ! now i have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones ! argh ! ||| 0
we tried the belkin in one car when we turned the ipod on the car battery immediately discharged we had to buy a new car battery and the ipod died we bought another belkin and tried it in a different car and with a different ipod in case the first incident was a coincidence and this ipod died too the ipods were under warranty the car battery was not we tried this with 2 different belkins in 2 different cars with 2 different ipods i would not recommend this product to anyone ||| 0

the case looks nice but not practical everytime you need to change the volume or track you have to pull your ipod out my ipod had scratch marks on it the first week unfortunately all the picture you see of this case is from the side view so you can not see that there is no opening for the wheel and the display i recommend iskin product ||| 0

the radio works great the last 2 sony walkman radios i have had you were able to clip onto your waiste band when exercising was just a large clip thing new one has a different type that you have to use a belt with ! and who uses a belt to work out i certainly dont i am using a very large safety pin thru the hole in the back and then i pin it onto my shorts has made a nice hole in the material of two pairs otherwise it is a great item ||| 0
i actually meant to order the philips brighter screen 20 cheaper bulkier but somehow i got confused when i placed the order this one looked beautiful so i was pretty psyched anyway and was definitely going to keep it i was planning on using this for work as i get a lot of dvd 's from clients so i popped one of those in and guess what it came up as invalid disc '' it 's supposed to play the majority of formats and i triple checked the disc in my other dvd players and it worked in my panasonic combo player a dvd worked fine although i did n't play it much more than the first menu so i know it 's not broken the first reviewer also noticed that it does n't play a bunch of homemade dvd 's so i will confirm that here if that 's gon na be a for you then stay away btw the dvd i was trying to play was made on a philips burner i did n't bother to test it with any others ||| 0
i ordered 2 of these realizing they would have limited adjustment range other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel what prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight this model is supposed to hold a 25 lb monitor it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb imac there is no tension adjustment already as tight as it would go and the computer just flopped forward with a light monitor i 'm sure it would be fine but do n't expect even close to the stated 25 lb rating ||| 0
i spent 400 16 months ago on two very similar portable audiovox dvd players for my kids for long roadtrips they were handled with care never abused or exposed to severe temperatures i think we got about 6 trips out of them then the screens went blank while in use and both units died within 24 hours of each other circuit city informed me the product is no longer on their shelves and referred me to audiovox who will do nothing since the product is now out of warranty extended warranties are useless on this kind of product who can wait weeks for repairs parents find another brand ||| 0
bought one from amazon they sat on the order for a week before shipping a unit that arrived dead went through the process and they sat on the order for over a week this time and the that one arrived dead with the exact same failure mode the second one looked as if it had been opened before accessory bag not sealed manuals out of place interior packaging worn i believe the second one they sent was a return that was then resent to me bad news ! ! ! i still had both and in hope of fixing on i contacted garmin who said they were indeed broken and offered to fix one and send it back this would mean i 'd have paid full price for what would then be a refurbished unit both of them returned i needed the unit right away for a desert trip amazon 's refund process made it such that they 'd not refund all of the funds but hold them on account those that were originally given to me as a gift certificate from my employer therefore i could not get the equipment for a local vendor i opened one month nearly to the day dealing with slow order processing bad units and more so i 'd not recommend the unit and i think amazon may need to review their own practices to ensure what they have in inventory is new and likely operational and that when a customer orders something they put in the effort to ship it asap ! ! without that if you have to buy one go to a local dealer put that batteries in at that shop and have them prove it works before you leave with it since you ca n't so that here do n't buy it here ||| 0
my first gps it was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features ability to save many tracks the software is very it worked very well on the flat and in unwooded conditions however do n't use one of these things to navigate in the bush use a compass the technology is just not there to cope with either valleys or an overhead canopy it was handy to confrm where i was when i found a clearing on top of a hill finally although the battery life is better than most it is still abysmal in summary these things are still a toy for a tramper rather than an essential tool ||| 0
i purchased two of these units the first one worked the second one has a problem in a side by side comparison the signal qualities of the two units vary i checked there accuracy and tracking with oziexplorer moving map software the first unit tracks pretty good but the second units position is off a large percentage of the time and sometimes as much as 400 meters i sent the faulty unit to garmin to be repaired they sent it back with a description of the problem and that it had been fixed i checked the unit out and it is the same as when i sent it to them now i 'm stuck with a dud ||| 0

i purchased this camera for my daughter for christmas it was small compact and fairly inexpesive perfect for a preteen first it took forever to charge the instructions indicate that it takes four hours after waiting for hours my daughter attempted to take pictures but the camera would not work the manual shows several different symbols that you should see in the lcd display but none of these symbols appeared on this camera i am returning the camera immediately and i would not advise anyone to purchase one ||| 0
i bought this so called stereo '' system at a big lot 's store for about 40.00 i figured since they were selling it there it must be a good deal and it looked very cool too it worked for about a month before it started skipping and remote was wigging out it never sounded any better than one of those old plastic 45 record players it looked good in my daughters bedroom but it lookes and sounds much better in the dumpster i ca n't believe this company can get away with selling this worthless crap i will never buy anything from them again ||| 0

i 've loved these headphones for the year or two i 've had them i still love them now when they work the problem is that the cord is shoddy when i plug into my laptop i have a hard time keeping it working i have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work if its not just right i 'll get sound in only one ear if at all i do n't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk i do n't think it has ever left my office and i do n't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it overall i like these things but i 'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit ||| 0
i purchased this in the hope that i would be able to record verbal messages to myself creative thoughts and ideas etc it does an adequate job of that i had also hoped i could use it as a simple player to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day this it wo n't do and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the olympus site that it would not function this way first even though it records wav files it does not let you handle them well at all to transfer recordings to your computer you have to install special software included but you can not transfer wav files back to the recorder according to the software guide if you want a to function easily like that you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a usb flash drive like the creative zen series i did not install the software as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer i can record directly to the pc with much higher quality so why bother noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise it makes more sense to simply repeat anything i record on the olympus and record it directly to the pc second the sound quality is not great given that wav files are what are used on cds one would expect more than what this device delivers it is noisy on either of the mic settings and i would have to describe the sound quality as medium do n't expect high fidelity this is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else even analog tape would be better for most things i may be fussier than most about this having some professional background in audio so the sound quality may be okay for most people people have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything finally playback was very disappointing to me it has only the simplest playback features it plays pauses fast forwards and reverses period you can not repeat either a single recording or portion of one and you can not create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play it plays manually one recording at a time and that is it you can not set markers to fast forward or reverse to like chapters on a dvd and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain in fact this recorder is defined more by what it can not do than what it can do it is well built physically although it is definitely designed for small hands and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands are n't small if all you want is to record medium quality voice this will work fine do n't expect it to record music or anything like that you will be disappointed think of it as the audio version of a 20 digital camera cheap quick grabs the image but no frills at all do n't expect much and you wo n't be disappointed i am usually very happy with olympus gear but this is definitely below their usual standard unless your needs are very spartan and smple i would recommend looking at more capable devices ||| 0

while spending hours trying to figure out how to set the alarm i sometimes wonder what hater of humanity actual designed this thing ||| 0
1. buttons are too small some of which are not spaced apart very well very convenient for somebody waking up who can accidentally hit the wrong button 2. buttons are labeled organized and layed out confusingly for example why not have an alarm interface '' which would include all of the alarm modes and features and maybe a radio interface '' which would include all of the radio you would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock but really do n't do it make the smart choice 3. too many i understand some people prefer all of the different features but i wanted a simple alarm clock with a and clock of course all of these special modes are set as the default so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode so for those who want a simple alarm clock definitely do not get this ! ! 4. the button handling event is flawed for example sometimes when i push a button it does not handle the event the device does n't think that you pressed the button so i would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly 5. it is very slow when holding the button down and waiting for the alarm clock to increment up and down 6. radio reception is very poor i have another radio right next to it that gets much better reception than this clock 7. led is not very bright and hard to read from 10 feet and farther out i have nothing against timex they make great watches this was written to protect anyone who who does not want to waste 30 ||| 0

while the price of the 8 in 1 card reader is reasonable consider this this card reader has a nasty habit of rendering smart media card useless evidently if you cut and paste or delete data on the sm card using thee 8 in 1 card reader the reader rewrites the signature file so that it can not be read by the camera so that 24 card has the potential to cost you over 80.00 in addition customer service is slow and i have had problems with the drivers ||| 0

i ordered the passport from amazon to save the 18 shipping escort radar was charging i was told by someone at escort radar that amazon was an authorized reseller after having my detector on for ten minutes right out of the box it did three self cal '' s then said service required '' i called escort radar and was told if you let the car power up the unit when you start the car the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused you must first start the car and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector '' it makes some sense but if this is really the case why do n't they put those instructions in their manual after trying this many times the unit was still confused '' so i returned it for a replacement my second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened this time escort radar told me if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night this has been found to cause problems '' well my lighter power goes off when i turn off the ignition so this does n't apply escort radar also told me that excessive heat '' has been causing them problems now we have had a few days of heat and i 'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car it gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country there are no warnings in the manual about not using it above or leaving it off in a hot car you would n't design a ski that does n't work below would you the most troubling part of my conversation with escort radar service department was they told me amazon is not an authorized reseller and they have no idea where they are getting the units from furthermore they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit not even for money ||| 0
i bought this one for its coaxial cable protection function but the result is terrible it greatly degrades the signal when i use it with tv the program on tv became unclear when i use it with computer the internet kept dropping i intended to return it to amazon and i found amazon 's return policy is that only partial refund for opened products how can i know it 's dysfunctional before i destroyed the package and used it in the future i only buy stuff at online stores with local stores such as bestbuy or circuit city so that i can easily get refund ||| 0
i bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my player through my radio i like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations i didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product looking back i should have i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there are n't many stations that you can listen to on the radi ||| 0

samsung is the worst we bought this tv in august and it was delivered in september to our new house we opened it on a sunday plugged it in and watched it for a while then on monday it would not come on they thought it was a lamp but that did n't fix it so they came and got it to service it we bought it for football season and football season is half over and we still have no tv they decided to replace it since they could n't fix it that was three weeks ago now they are giving us the runaround blaming for the delay in sending the new one during a phone conversation with samsung they basically said they were so far behind on shipping because they had so many to ship out ie lots of them have problems and are being replaced is the way i took it ||| 0
after waiting almost 6 months for this skypephone and its competitor from belkin to come to market through numerous postponements i just gave up and bought an asus smartphone for just over double the price of the netgear i got a windows ce pda with gsm capability and full skype compatibility when browsing through your phone contacts your are given the choice to call through gsm or skype because you have you can make skype calls and chats from any covered area plus you can go on the internet using ie and check your with outlook i have also read that the skype software that runs on dedicated phones like the netgear and the belkin is very crude due to the lack of processing power whereas with a windows device you have much faster processors that allow a skype software closer to the one used on pcs for those of you alergic to windows just wait for the skype for symbian release and buy a nokia or sonyericsson smartphone bottom line skype is too good an application to be wasted on poorly designed hardware ||| 0

i love the basic design great linkage and software interface of this scanner however i value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit i received last week it inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed so if you 're scanning a doc and it misses one somewhere along the way have you really accomplished anything no you must either try the whole thing again with likely the same result or you must figure out what page s is missing scan it separately and go thru a simple yet not expedient acrobat process to insert the omitted page in the end this machine made it +90 of the way to being a really great product but the shortcoming fouls half the machine 's overall utility swing a little bit harder next time fujitsu ||| 0
i 've gone thru multiple revisions of firmware and multiple calls to support and this piece of junk still does not work with the support calls are worthless as a computer professional i find it appalling that would introduce and continue to sell this product which clearly does not operate correctly ||| 0
i bought this machine on august 3 2005 and within one week of using it as an outgoing fax only there was a machine error i called customer service and after being on hold for 23 minutes i was able to speak with a live representative i was told that the machine would need to be replaced they sent me a refurbished unit the warranty indicates that any replacement units will be refurbished units they sent the base unit only so i had to remove the drum unit paper tray and handset from the original fax machine to use with the replacement unit so after only a couple of hours of using the replacement unit i was back on hold to report another machine error 12 minutes and i finally get a apparently the drum unit which is less than one month old is bad so now i 'm waiting for the replacement drum unit do n't ever buy a brother machine they 're horrible machines and trying to get through to customer service is very very time consuming ||| 0

i was terribly disappointed in this product which i bought for use in my canon pixma printer the image is grainy and if you touch the photo within 5 minutes you will leave marks i laid anothe picture on top of one done 5 minutes earlier and they stuck together i have had very good luck with canon paper ||| 0
this would be a great product is the chemical smell was not so bad and last so long it has a horrible smell that just will not go away i saw others mention the same issue but thought i would give it a try it smells other than that the comfort is great but i gave it 2 weeks to air out and the smell will not go away i would suggest you do n't buy this is you have a sensitive nose it kinda smells like those squishy foam beds and slippers you see at brookstone ||| 0
yes yes i know griffin has ipod mini compatability all over their roadtrip web page but the sad fact is when you recieve it you will not find an adapter for the ipod mini in the box although there are adapters for other ipods when you read the instruction book you will find that you must purchase an adapter from apple computer to make it work calling apple i find that they no longer sell the adapter when i called griffin i was surprised to find that if you have any other ipod than mini and the adapter is not in the box they will send you one they recommended that i return the roadtrip which is what i did save yourself the aggrevation if you have an ipod mini stay away from griffin technology ||| 0
i had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the the main reason is the speed i have a lab and we tested the max internet throughput of the 's at ! this is unacceptable oh yes this is with the latest firmware several calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem i contacted their legal deptartment the same day several promises were made on netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist i reinstall my os ! i have successfully sued to get my money back with all of my venting done i would like to say that i am still a fan of the prosafe line and will continue to use it but netgear be warned i will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported ||| 0
most reviews do n't seem to mention a key spec the throughput of a firewall i just upgraded my cable connection to the new up to plan and bought an firewall to use with it without the firewall in place i measured about download speed when i installed the firewall in between the modem and one computer download speed went down to i also discovered that if the enable keyword blocking '' checkbox is enabled the throughput went down to even if there were no keywords ! this firewall is useless if you have a connection ||| 0

we had such high hopes for this product and sadly had to return it only 20 feet away from the base unit the clarity was very very poor we 've owned many regular cordless phones of varying quality and yet the least expensive of these were better than this they just were n't waterproof it 's a great concept if they could just make them work well sure wish we could find a good waterproof phone ! ! ||| 0
do n't get me wrong this is a pretty clever gadget however it 's mising one thing in terms of usability an switch this really limits the usability of both since it 's typical to want to turn the flashlight off for a moment or the laser pointer on for a moment i ca n't see me using this laser pointer in a real presentation since it 'd either be on all the time or i 'd be pulling the light in and out all the time neither of which make me look cool so if you 're going to buy this keep this limitation in mind ||| 0
finally next time i ca n't find my keys in the dark all i need to do is find this thingie and fumble it into my ipod 's holes what a lifesaver ! and in the same box is the laser pointer so i do n't have to stop listening to just because i 'm doing some silly corporate presentation ! while it is a little tough to dance and fry an airline pilot 's eyes at the same time it is the latest craze so i love this product !

this mousepad may seem as a great product but at times the rest becomes a little bit tiresome and i think it get 's in the way of my hand and the mouse it did take me a great deal of time to get used to this pad but anyone else who use 's it has found it in the way and annoying i have to agree with this it truly does get into the way of my hand and its a little bit confusing also it is much bigger than most mousepad 's it takes up a great deal of space ||| 0
the noise canceling is just barely discernible in comparison to when it is turned off and the music quality is not comparable to other earbuds in this price range 60 list 35 amazon the cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged but i do n't like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into combined with the stronger cord better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears ||| 0
i had the same exact experience with the poor fit of these headphones and the rude customer service their ' phones do n't fit well either on the phone philips told me to buy a part at radioshack to resolve my problem they could n't give me an rs part number because it is n't their product '' but they recommend that over selling me or sending me replacement ear pieces according to them this problem was all my fault i should have realized it sooner saved my receipts packaging an returned them within 30 days from a technology standpoint the electronics are outstanding for the size and price i like the performance of the phones on planes trains etc they really work well but i am amazed that phillips would risk losing customers over pennies worth of silicone it is a shame philips ca n't do better with the customer touchpoints like the ear piece design their phone support and part replacement policies take a look at shure 's products shure sells replacement foam and triple flange sleeve ear pieces for their products if you are in the same boat with me and like these except for the fit i think the triple flange sleeves may work as a replacement for the stock phillips ear pieces ||| 0
if you 're not that picky about sound quality with music then these may work for you i think the frequency response range with these earbuds are pretty minimal to me the music is all mids it 's missing significant highs and lows for this price range i gave these away to a friend who 's not that picky at all but she could tell a difference in sound quality right away she normally uses the ipod earbuds which are uncomfortable to her however the noise canceling out weighs the sound quality so she prefers to use these earbuds over her ipod buds riding a crowded train or bus hopefully i can find something affordable that has good frequency response or maybe i need to educate myself is it the frequency response the impedence or something else that covers the sound spectrum i 'm just looking for a good balance of lows mids and highs ||| 0
so i was satisfied with the qualities the cloth cable is very nice and does n't tangle as much as the usual plastic ones i liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning the headphones i purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and i found only one to be suitable for my ears of course after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now i ca n't use these earphones until i find a replacement somewhere which is proving to be troublesome super i did n't buy these on clearance at target so that hurts my pocketbooks and i am very annoyed right now in the meantime i 've returned to some 10 headphones and i really miss the quality of these philips earbuds life sucks and i want to die because now i can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation ||| 0
i agree with the person who says there are no instructions and poor image quality i wonder if they gave us a mini jack like games systems use if it would work better on tvs that have the 3 jacks on the front games systems get good image quality so why is this so bad no info on this from monster looks like a very good product but i will return it unfortunately i did discover though that i can use a stereo jack with on one end and a mini jack on the ibook end to give me audio speakers on any tv or stereo for my itunes and audio for a dvd that i am playing but i do n't need to spend this much money to get that if the image were good i would keep it i would rather show my slide shows from the computer the image was very ||| 0
i have had this phone for about three years i bought it primarily to use it as a good quality with mute for long conference calls it was quite expensive i paid 200 to get it but here are what i have found to be its shortcomings no display this just baffles me i get on all other phones in the house except this one i have tried every possible varient resetted settings disconnected other phones etc but nothing works i always get no id message '' on the lcd the second major shortcoming is that often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone one way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly but that defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a hence will not work in case of emergencies finally two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter one good thing about the phone is that it looks quite good has a professional appearance and claims to have a ||| 0

i just purchased yesterday the home dock deluxe for list price at a local retailer i read all the reviews most of them bad but i got it anyway the menu on tv part being my motivation and so far i am not feeling good about buying it 1. the sound quality is very poor almost every song has some distortion and sounds muffled '' along with a good hiss i thought i was listening to a 70 's era cassette it was so bad ! i have a high end system and the poor sound is very noticeable in desperation and checking to make sure my amp was working fine i plugged in my apple dock from my gen photo and the standard apple av cable the sound problem disappeared and was crystal clear 2. the menus to not work properly my nano seems to work ok but my gen photo does not the menus are rather slow and the artist or album or song titles disappear at random sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data but mostly it is just blank the cursor will scroll down as though there is data there but nothing shows on the screen you can play the music from the blank screen but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you can not see any titles i like the idea but very very frustrating 3. there is no support at all from the dlo website it just lets me download a pdf of the manual or to buy more accessories i did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems i am not impressed 4. there also all the other problems listed elsewhere too light and build quality poor annoying power led on front no artwork on tv menu etc 5. so basically it is way too expensive not worth it not even worth 10 of the price charged i should have listened to all the comments above and not believed some of the official '' reviews on the web so it is back in the box and ready for a trip back to the store i guess my lesson is that i should trust the reviews ||| 0

i hate this contraption and i stupidly let 30 days pass before i realized how much i hate it now i start every morning with a boy i hate this thing '' why well here are few reasons why you can not read the numbers unless you are within 18 '' and to get a backlight you must depress any button '' a bad idea but horribly executed the backlight lasts four seconds way too fast in the night and any button '' is a lie because you ca n't press stop '' nor the on '' for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then in the dark have to figure out how to terminate the cd player spends more time reading '' your cd than it does playing it the '' button is very sensitive and lord knows what you will wake up to the screech of a not tuned in am station happens way too often the worst of it all was i called eton to tell them how much i hated it just thought they might want to know i had a friendly conversation with a very nice receptionist who assured me they wanted me to be happy and would do something but first she wanted me to talk to the so i waited a week for him to return my call and he was quite rude saying if there is nothing wrong with it everything is wrong but they do n't count that there is nothing they can do he offered to trade mine for a different one just the same and i said why bother '' it was a classic story of i made it so it is by definition without errors now leave me alone just buy it and be thrilled with my brilliant design ||| 0

i bought this drive with the advice from my father who has bought several lacie 's for his company he 's always had good luck with them the first thing that i noticed when i opened the box was that there was a gap between the case and the faceplate i called lacie customer service and they sent me instructions on how to open the case and also noted my serial number so that i would n't void my warranty the problem was that there were 2 screws that hold the faceplate onto the internal chassis who were not even tighted as if they started the screws and did n't tighten them by the way the actual hd inside the case is a maxtor if i had know that prior to purchase i would not have bought the lacie i fixed the problem with the case and turned it only to be hit with a high pitched winning sound coming from the hd this noise will drive me crazy and is not ultra quiet '' as noted in the description i 'm sending it back to amazon for a refund ||| 0

from day one back in late august 2006 i 've had problems with this router which i bought only because my isp would n't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord since i work from home this was n't an option at the time i 'm not a tech guy i do n't care much for gadgets but i 'm not stupid either and i could n't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of windows i do n't i have an imac once set up the router worked fine for about a month and then i started experiencing connectivity issues i called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning ' or some such reset my static ip and all was well for another week when the same issue losing connection with the router after minutes online arose again so i called support again got a guy after 7 minutes but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update and then basically hung up on me unacceptable so i called back sat on hold for minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone finally after a third try i got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day my isp is coming tuesday to install another outlet no documentation the install cd is configured for windows and would n't work in mac os online help sucks the 800 support line sucks this product sucks do not buy it ||| 0
i purchased this router not from amazon about 6 months ago when my very reliable router died i purchased it locally and someone came out and installed it i have had numerous problems with this router since then it does not stay connected and there is actually no option for always on '' after having some other problems i took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware after that it lost the setup information twice and the info had to be then today after being instructed to reset the router it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade there was no apparent way out of this so i obtained the upgrade and according to the router message it was updated successfully after that i could not get the router to work at all i gave up and ordered an entirely different router the same brand that i has used before with tremendous success my summary save yourself time and aggravation and do n't buy the linksys ||| 0

i bought this so i could listen to my ipod in my car in the city the first couple of times it worked great but after that something happened it just would n't work all i heard was static no matter what frequency i tried this on i have yet to take a road trip with it so maybe that will work better but right now i am not happy with the product maybe the fact that i live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it but it used to work on some frequencies and now it just does n't anymore i am very disappointed ||| 0

i originally purchased the unit during the winter because of a sale but i did n't install it until the beginning of july for our cross country trip from oregon to dc during the trip there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the pacific northwest i kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city once i got out of the nw i had no problems picking up a signal unless i was in a long tunnel or deep valley i did notice the unit did get hot during the trip and i think that is why it is acting the way it is now two months later it works fine when first turned on but after 15 minutes the signal flutuates and at times no signal is received the tech support said that i needed to check the wires but since it is 'recently ' installed and it does n't happen when first turned on i 'm ruling it a receiver problem the unit is placed just below the radio head and has been exposed to direct sunlight when parked i 'm sure it did n't help i 'm currently looking for a better unit and xm said they would transfer the remainder of the account to the new radio without inducing an activation charge ||| 0

a 10 cable does the same thing do not believe the hype monster is overpriced and people are starting to realize it its digital and either it reads it or it doesnt ||| 0
have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you an arm and a leg '' these cables cost that your first son and bidding rights to your estate do n't get me monster makes great cables let there be no confusion on this point but they 're just incredibly expensive and this is made much worse with these cables several people have pointed out that the digital signal on hdmi cables must adhere to and certain standards even a 10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production and this is largely true unless bluray implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future there 's really very little difference between hdmi cables yes the pins and other features will improve your connection a bit but the improvement will be far less than you 'd see between any other cheap '' versus designer '' cables on the market but monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference and that 's worth mentioning this cable is built sturdy so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it and the shielding is n't just the usual electrical monster cables are toughened to the point that i would n't doubt if they 're certified against nuclear fallout if you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an emp strike you 're looking at the right cables but for nearly all consumers these cables cost as much as alternatives with no real plusses at the very least you can pick up a cable sony etc at a price 40 to get the increased sturdiness and the connections and over these products the monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding please do look up a cheaper alternative this time and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean you 'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about 100 hdmi cables ||| 0
ok it functions well as a clock radio just fine reliable but that 's not too much to expect yes it will charge your ipod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually though not gradual enough gets louder the adaptor for my nano fit fine and i did n't find the clock too bright it has 3 settings but the sound is really terrible it sounds like its coming from a transistor radio as well it advertises that you will be able to go to sleep and wake up with your ipod but as we know you do n't need a clock radio to do that your ipod will do that on its own if you set it i took this back after 5 days and hooked up some cheap computer speakers with a volume control they really sound better i swear ||| 0

i just purchased the hp from costco and burned the cdr disc came with drive the lightscribe worked really well it was the first experience so i came here for reviews on dvdr i was told that the verbatim is of top quality and the lightscribe picture is even better than the hp 's so i purchased the verbatim received today i was so excited that i immediately burn two discs with the best setting but both come out fuzzy and presented the out of focus '' dull feel look terrible with no detail compared to the hp bonus disc is this a joke this is my first amazon review ca n't help to vent my disappointment thanks for the super fast shipping anyway ||| 0
i have purchased 10 of these drives all at once what a mistake they are very flakey and will 'disappear ' while copying data to them by usb you have to turn the drive off and back on for windows to find it again i do not have this problem with any other usb drive only lacie drives you can not use one as a backup for this very reason copying large amounts of data will fail and you have to start over or copy in chunks one drive failed after 8 months only at the 10 month mark did i realize it was still under warranty it had a 1 year warranty so 2 months left i contacted lacie and after asking for a copy of the original invoice which clearly listed the purchase date they began ignoring my email and would not honor their warranty no rma after requesting one 5 times no more email responses since they could not come up with a reason to refuse service do not buy one of these there are many drives with longer warranties that are more reliable from better companies ||| 0
this drive suffers from repeated delayed write file errors ultimately it means you will lose all the data on it it is extremely noisy to the point of damaging your hearing lacie support is poor avoid ||| 0
as of right now i am an apple student developer most of my work comes from filmmaking as i 'm an independent filmmaker and all of my post production work relies heavily upon my apple tower as well as a ton of external harddrive storage while some of my lacie hd 's have worked great many of them have simply failed me here are the pro 's 1. great interface both firewire 400 and 800 and they are easy to daisychain 2. they are fast 7200 rpm and usually if the drive is good the performance will show cons 1. very weak body forget if you drop this thing even one inch it 'll be dead 2. very tough to hookup to other drives when i say this i mean it is impossible to stack this drive or try and put it in a space where it 'll stay put the biggest problem i do n't know what accounts for this whether its the bridge or the drive itself but lacie 's drives fail way too much i 've probably purchased around 14 lacie drives in the past 4 years for varioius film projects and associate ones of the 14 i have had 5 completely fail on me this is simply unacceptable for any drive company when you consider it all companies like maxtor offer drives with the same interface same speeds but at a lower price with that said take a look at maxtor whose drives are housed in a very indestructive body on a sidenote lacie has honored the warranties on their drives and when they 're open their customer service is very helpful but i 've lost too much data at this point to recommend the ||| 0
i had a previous good experience with a jabra headset this one was recommended for my panasonic cordless phone by jabra however the sound quality is terrible it lacks any kind of high frequency response and so sounds very boomy and full of bass making it almost impossible to use it also needs a foam cover since any kind of slight wind movement makes it extremely noisy i contacted jabra about this product but received no response maybe it would work better with a different phone but definitely not with my panasonic ||| 0
i was using it as a backup device and it failed after about 12 months so i am ripping it apart and putting in a new ultraata disk in just hope the box is not frying the disk i noticed in another review they had a western digital i had a segate baracuda doubt that it makes any difference i am sure it is just low bidder ||| 0
consumer beware ! ! ! ! this product does not work as advertised if you put more than 1000 songs onto this device playlists cease to function this is very very sad for a player with of memory it 's supposed to hold over 2000 songs but stops working correctly after 1000 songs are loaded wow unbelievable this is a bug on the apple discussion forums yet apple has neither acknowledged nor fixed this bug yet will they ever who cares why should they if consumers like you keep buying it and raving about it i bought my nano but returned it two days later when i found out the problem was known but not fixed and not fixable apple should not be shipping products with known bugs in them ! do n't they test these things ! ! ! by the way the same problem also occurs on the nano if you manage to squeeze more than 1000 songs onto it which is n't all that hard to do if you do n't care about having more than 1000 songs or you do n't care about playlists actually working as advertised what are you doing shopping for an player better stick with your ||| 0
do not buy this item it is very liable to break within the first week of purchase and i bought 2 of them so statistically it 's not jsut me the first time the door broke and without the door there 's no way to hold the ethernet cable to the connection the second time the usb part broke off and got stuck in my computer and i could not put it back together all in all not the best product out there try instead the belkin usb to ethernet adaptor ||| 0
do n't buy this product there simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase since it was 30 days outside the warrantly apple support told me sorry tough luck '' i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong ! second ipod just died same battery problem this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and of course by the time i got in i was past the 12 month warranty period who keeps track of the purchase date i sure did n't other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year it is a fantastic product i 'm just sorry that it did n't last twice ! cause otherwise i 'd be a fan ||| 0
please search for the thread on the linksys support forum titled intermittent drop of connection '' which goes on for 4 pages with no reply from linksys support i 'd post a url but that is against the review guidelines here at amazon the only way to fix the problems that occur with this router is to buy a different model or better yet a different brand it appears that linksys does n't really care about the issue i returned this router after the second day of dealing with it 's constant connection drops and bought a belkin instead ||| 0

from cellphone and also the pager era i began my love affair with motorola do n't need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great ! do n't buy these ! they fall into the former category i needed them quickly to give my time to practice using them before we went on a cruise so when i went to their house for the weekend i bought them from the hated best buy '' i am returning all 4 ! 2 sets of 2 handsets here was my experience i went in and saw the midland and the cobra along side the motorola not knowing much of midland but recognizing cobra from their history with phones and electronics i opted with the very stylish motorola 's i know big mistake ! i am a computer programmer and very intelligent but when confronted with products i do not undestand i go for the brand name which is something that can be forgiven if as now you find out what the problem is and correct it i took them home and recharged them first things first the feel in your hand excellent they feel as good as they look i purchased these to go on a cruise to the mexican riviera and to maintain contact both on the boat and in the ports puerto vallarta mazatlan and cabo san lucas we wanted to make sure we did not lose '' my really ! i mean it ! no really anyway charged them up and turned them on they come with a group of 3 aa rechargable batteries that fit nicely and only one way they are keyed in the battery compartment this is nice if you are out and running around and your charge goes down simply buy 3 aa alkaline batteries and go on your way there is no problem if you forget you have the normal aa batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand unlike other units the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack not the handset if you put it batteries the charger makes no connection to the handset if you put in the rechargable battery pack 2 silver contacts from the battery pack contact the charging stand and voila the unit charges fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare though ! it must be generic and able to fit several different motorola products production outsourced to giant int'l ltd so if you thought this was a genuine motorola built item you are mistaken the entire talkabout line are outsourced for production as the charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the 's i am a smart person though so i chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it then i attempted to insert the 's i say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction after you get it to exactly the right position look on the charger to watch for the led to light up the the hard part of charging that is is over next item bad red lcd backed screen hard to read in any light and impossible in the sunlight settings were easy enough channel vibrate noaa broadcasts etc however the advertised qt ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible motorola handset does not work unless you hit the ptt push to talk button or the call button wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking my are new to technology and are used to experiencing when their kids were young therefore this is unusual they automatically want to push the button and talk so the first part of what they say is immediately lost i say first part '' i am assuming i actually caught a portion of what they said this brings me to the second major flaw this unit contains a horrible speaker if the volume is too low then you ca n't hear it too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it we were really to find a happy medium and in a noisy room it would 've been impossible to hear anything some merchants list these as 5 mile radios the packaging says 10. the 1 watt gmrs suggests about we got less than 1. directly over a lake in vehicles on the we drove less than 2 miles from their house which is directly on the interstate and got no signal i got back to my house in san jose on top of communications hill the largest hill '' in the area and could not communicate to my spouse less than mile away while he was coming up our road ! since the weekend i have spent all my extra time on and consumer reports reviewing all the offerings the latter consumer reports ' reviews are from july in 2002 ! so i think i am going to return these and purchase the midland 5 watt 's from amazon remember doubling the wattage in this case more than doubling does not give double the signal as another others have stated increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distance ie 2 watts to 4 watts does not double the distance the signal can reach hope this reveiw helps you ||| 0
i purchased a biopod in march of 2006. received brand new unit that included omnipass software version this software version released in 2004. contacted company that produced the software and they refused to upgrade to their latest version that had been released a month earlier unless they charged me the upgrade fee the version of software that comes with the biopod pretty much only works with internet explorer and other microsoft software the new version 4 supposedly works with firefox and several other software programs i recommend you avoid this product due to old software i returned mine and am ordering the ibm fingerprint reader ||| 0

when realtime traffic monitoring came to my city i immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife 's daily business driving miles weekly crisscrossing a area through major traffic routes i quickly settled on an automotive gps with realtime traffic monitoring there are not yet many choices in this area so the options boiled down to this unit and the garmin 2720 these use fm radio for the traffic info the units like the tomtom 700 and garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since i do n't want xm radio i chose the cobra for its large screen and positive reviews in areas that were important to me its flawed routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be used in a region address lookup and traffic monitoring were the primary needs in short i do n't know much about how the cobra performs because i was only able to use it for a few short test trips this is because the mounting hardware is one of the most deficient pieces of engineering i have ever encountered in electronics gear the only mounting option is via suction cup which in tests would adhere reliably only to nearly flat glass a disc for attaching the suction cup is also provided but i did not attempt to use it and would not trust it to be able to hold this heavy 1.25 pound unit over the long run if your vehicle does not have a flat section of windshield in a convenient location you will have very few options for mounting this unit california law prohibits attaching things to the windshield meaning that california users either need to risk a minor ticket or find an acceptable alternate mounting point good luck to you i was unable to find one in three different vehicles ! compounding the problem is that the mount has a very limited positioning range and easily runs out of adjustment room for most potential mounting alternatives cobra does not offer any other mounts or mounting accessories at all no beanbag or friction mount no clamp no mount nothing if there is any aftermarket option ram mount etc i was unable to find it you are stuck with cobra 's proprietary mount unless you are willing to modify the unit or its mounting pieces and fabricate an adapter for a garmin or ram mount base i was willing to go the extra mile to make this unit work in my vehicle even though the best solution would have been very awkward to dismount and remount making it a potential theft target the final straw was when i found that the traffic receiver was faulty and i was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a timely manner two days now and counting enough 's enough something was telling me that this unit was n't the right choice so this unit is being returned and i 've already ordered a garmin 2720 with traffic receiver in replacement the prices for the units through amazon are nearly the same especially when factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring the cobra comes with three months and gets 60 per year after that while the garmin comes with 15 months and has the same annual cost after that so you have to add 60 to the cobra to get a truly equivalent price garmin also has excellent mounts with a range of attachment options some of the best map and routing tools and a long track record with gps units it does have a smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface but at least i can mount it properly and be able to tuck it away and remount it easily to prevent theft this unit gets two stars only because my brief experience with its function appears to live up to all the positive reviews but overall it 's like a sports car with no wheels ! i 100 recommend against it for california users and suggest that others try to lay hands on a sample unit to see if it can be properly mounted in your vehicle before laying out 750 ||| 0

it does n't matter what writer i used velocity worked ! not one disk became a coaster i loved the velocity until i order 2 more spindles i ordered it directly for the manufacture when i received it the outside plastic covering was cracked half the disks had the jitters and the other half was coasters it seems to me that they trick you into ordering one with a great offer including free shipping if you order any more the person shipping it to you send you the rejects from quality assurance i will never again order this product again period ! ||| 0

i had a terrible time getting a station to come in even close to fm quality there was always a bunch of static and the stereo buzzed between songs because i had to keep the volume too high the high band of frequencies seemed to work best but then it led to crackling speakers everytime i turned something electrical on in the car it also seemed to kill batteries at a surprising rate on a positive note i loved the fact that it would also function for my son 's dvd but in the end it had way too much static so i hunted for anothe ||| 0
this is a total waste of money and engineering plenty of free frequencies in my area and it would barely connect to anything sound quality horrible even when the device is right next to the antenna on a portable fm player wrapping it back up and sending it back ||| 0
the transmission quality is very poor i was unable to find a single frequency free of static while operating the belkin tunecast ii in my car i found that driving over or under bridges under traffic lights under power lines or near large trucks increases the static to a level where the music can not be heard at all the only way i could get audio clarity equal to that of a dirty and scratched record or a distant am station was to hold the transmitter to the face of my radio what a piece of poo ! can i give it zero stars and do n't even get me started on the excessive packaging that you 'll need to use a diamond tipped to open ||| 0
if you have a palm read this before buying this device although our sd gps card should work with palm os without a driver as its compliant currently we are not aware of any software that supports our sd gps card based on this i regrettably have to say that at this moment it does not work with palm os device we are currently in the process of developing a palm os driver that will allow the device to be used independent of software support when this becomes available it will be posted on our i bought this for my father for christmas it cost a lot of money we all got really excited about it it does n't work ||| 0
i have had two of these units i would definitely not recommend anyone buying the save yourself some money and get something else both of the units lasted only 14 months i did hardly any typing with them only forms and applications the printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing contacted brother international usa and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months save yourself some money and buy a big chief table and a number 2 pencil ||| 0
after reading some good and bad reviews i went ahead and bought them anyway they will not stay in my ears i tried the three different sized ear buds but non will do the job very irritating so i do not recommend them at all too bad because if they stay in when you sit really still the sound quality is really good aloh ||| 0
bought these and used them once had to remove them when i found myself in dire need of some excedrin migraine what do you get for your 39 cheap tinny sound that 's like being plugged into a busted walkman the buds themselves do n't remain stable in the ear so forget about using them while engaging in activity such as jogging walking neck movement etc these are by far the worst earbuds on the market how could apple stoop so low do n't be fooled ! do a google search for these and you 'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product you 've been warned i used to use koss earbuds which were pretty good i sold these ipod duds in favor of the xtrememac headphones which are the best ones available and worth the extra money ||| 0
i 've had this camera replaced by linksys 4 times the first time was due to the camera crashing on a weekly basis the second replacement worked fine until i upgraded my router and switched from wep to wpa after the switch the camera would not connect to the router switching back to wep of course worked linksys has replaced the camera 3 times for this issue and with the last support call confirmed that there is a known problem with wpa encryption and this camera ||| 0
i have extensive experience with wireless system setup and operation my whole system is all linksys gear after four hours on this camera i give up when you update the firmware it erases everything you programmed into the camera so beware i could get the camera to work in wifi mode picture is decent not great the motion sensing function triggers quite well the frustration comes from an inability to get the email function to work kept getting an error message with the system parameters setup so it should have worked the faq section on linksys website is almost i did not bother to call because in my past experience that is of minimal help and very frustrating features sound great but could not get it to work right i will find another unit ||| 0
this is my first amazon review of any type i was quite happy to finally get a wireless keyboard and mouse when this was pulled from the box the finish was splotchy it looks like someone painted the keys in a garage i expected better now i have used it for a couple of weeks in an office environment and already one of the plastic keyboard legs has broken i am not hard on the equipment and do n't know how it happened once in a while i press keys and nothing happens i can live with that on the other hand the mouse works as expected before you purchase one check the process for returning it ! i would rather put up with the crappy keyboard i will continue to purchase many books from amazon but my computer hardware will come from dell ||| 0
this router had the range of my standard linksys which suddenly burned out after less then a year the speed when i could get a signal was 1 to 11 mbps my old router held a steady i did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house but i could n't use it with this router the expander only works with the basic so no way to even boost the signal on this new one support was a joke could n't get any help or explaination as to why the expanded range '' was so much less range the the previous unexpanded range '' bought another older version and everything 's great again do n't waste your money or time on this ||| 0

these earphones provide excellent sound for the money rich bass sharp treble and tight sound isolation with the comfortable and adjustable rubber earpieces however i experienced painful electric shocks in both ears if i put pressure on my eardrums such as getting up from a chair and that was before i stood in the puddle of water just kididng shocks occured in first and replacement pair they eventually replaced with an model i have no problems with other sony headphones or earphones i think the speaker membrane was positioned too close to my eardrums since there are on other comments about this issue i 'll assume its isolated but beware of shocks on perhaps a smaller scale ||| 0

this product is terrible and i 'm going to return mine or throw it away it constantly wanders to places i do n't want it to be or trails where i think it should be based on my usage of other mice at this point i consider it unusable i 've tried it on several surfaces to see if it was a tracking problem but noticed no real change in behavior i think what 's happening is it keeps trying to go to sleep while i 'm moving it because the tracking is ok as long as i 'm moving it very quickly but when i 'm trying to precision target something like an icon or a piece of text it starts jumping erratically i keep it about 6 inches from my laptop at all times and the laptop is n't complaining about connection problems ||| 0

using this product to communicate between motorcycles as promoted by the very fact that there are motorcycle headsets for your helmut available for these radios is clearly unsafe the distractions created by the radios having no range after about 100 feet can prove fatal for a motorcycle ryder due to a momentary lapse in concentration just as it would be between a bike and a car i purchased these radios as the better of the midland lot with an 18 mile range an outright lie i bought them to communicate between two either myself and my brother after also purchasing 2 of the motorcycle helmut headstets or between me on the bike and my girlfriend driving my jeep following me on a long distance ride we do n't even get 100 feet out of them when the radios begin to breakup and are usless the range increases as long as you are not moving i have n't tested them while one user is moving on the road or on the highway and one user sitting stationary i intend to contact midland about a full refund but if they do n't work when you are moving then what good are they how could they fabricate these claims of 18 miles even if they could n't do 18 miles how about a half mile how about mile or mile not even that this is a discrace i 'm just another customer handed a bogus deal do not buy any gmrs stuff from midland ||| 0

i ordered the passport from amazon to save the 18 shipping escort radar was charging i was told by someone at escort radar that amazon was an authorized reseller after having my detector on for ten minutes right out of the box it did three self cal '' s then said service required '' i called escort radar and was told if you let the car power up the unit when you start the car the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused you must first start the car and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector '' it makes some sense but if this is really the case why do n't they put those instructions in their manual after trying this many times the unit was still confused '' so i returned it for a replacement my second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened this time escort radar told me if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night this has been found to cause problems '' well my lighter power goes off when i turn off the ignition so this does n't apply escort radar also told me that excessive heat '' has been causing them problems now we have had a few days of heat and i 'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car it gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country there are no warnings in the manual about not using it above or leaving it off in a hot car you would n't design a ski that does n't work below would you the most troubling part of my conversation with escort radar service department was they told me amazon is not an authorized reseller and they have no idea where they are getting the units from furthermore they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit not even for money ||| 0
i 've got an engineering degree in computer science i 've been supporting dollar web applications for years it took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for there is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight player it 's not ipod caliber quality the only reason you 'd get it is for the rhapsody service if you are not highly technical and patient move on ! player itself works fine ||| 0
i ordered this unit with high expectations lots of memory expandable multiple modes from a well known company and an excellent price how could i go wrong easily enough as it turns out i was unable to load it and control the play lists trying to use it in mtp mode always crashed the host bsod so i reverted to msd mass storage device mode using drag and drop dragging a folder to the device was pointless most of the time the files did n't even show up and when they did they were scattered all over the place i copied 82 files from the lord of the rings set into a single folder only 52 could be found even during play back but they could be seen from my computer '' on the host system after fooling around with it for a couple of hours i gave up and called sandisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out i have to admit that i was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the music folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted a totally useless method this was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into imagine listening to the first movement of swan lake followed immediately by something from 9 inch nails then maybe a bach cantata ! using media player to sync did no better creating a playlist of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop a hopeless mess no play order missing files and so on after spending 3 hours with sandisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit the tech had no more idea that i did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job this is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification but it 's hopelessly flawed in the implementation and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons throughly frustrated it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after i received it i just can not recommend this player it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well as it stands it 's without merit as a player ||| 0
i had high expectations for this product having bought some of sandisk 's other products the problem with the is that sandisk does n't give users the control or the versatility over file management for example using it in the mass storage msc usb mode one is forced to create playlists in windows media player this works but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped it would be far better if one could just drag folders and music files to the right folder and play them with multiple folder levels this would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes instead sandisk adopts an almost microsoft mentality in its approach it 's our way or the highway '' once one masters creating playlists they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory it 's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews one can easily get the idea that the series can be set up like just another usb storage device including other previous sandisk products well you can but it wo n't make much difference if the device wo n't play ||| 0
do not buy this item it is terrible the itrip has awful reception it isnt worth the money wait for something better ||| 0

it 's better if you spend your money in something else it has a ridiculous transmitting power so bad that even radio transmitters from miles away interferes with this device 1 ft from the radio receiver the audio quality is so bad that totally destroys the pleasure of listening to your music in fact this device should be forbidden to be sold or should be tagged as phony advertise ||| 0
this is about the worse thing i 've ever bought for an ipod accessory it does not work all i heard was static and very little music if you do want to hear music you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you 'll get is static i bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it i was hesitant to buy it seeing almost every review has said it does n't work but i bought it anyway do n't buy it ! every review i 've seen has negative feedback for this item and i agree with everyone i figured since griffin made a new itrip it would be better and work great however it is the total opposite from that i do not recommend this product at all do n't waste your time or money ||| 0

we bought three creative players my husband and i have the zen micro and my daughter the zen all three of ours just froze up and stopped working with one year i did n't even use mine but maybe two hours per week good thing my daughter 's was within her one year period by a couple of days she still had to pay 25.00 now my husband and i have to just junk ours and buy something else customer service is awful ! ! they wo n't talk to you unless you show your receipt at least three times what a piece of garbage ! ! ||| 0
do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i 'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive ||| 0
i have a but a lot of the 's are having the same problem i can play all of the songs that i owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and ca n't be reinstalled i 've done a little research about the disappearing player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the 's and 1 other model i ca n't remember right now and iriver ca n't figure it out although i 've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug buy with caution ||| 0
i 've had this player since it came out and if anyone is still considering getting it i must advise otherwise the player itself looks and feels great and the navigational features are very easy to use the problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable i have used 3 versions of this player expecting each time that the player was simply faulty and all of them glitch up terribly i constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play it also freezes half of the time that i try to sync with wmp in addition sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my 's list of tracks even though they no longer exist on the player finally iriver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products ! as a owner of two irivers and the 120 i have seen for a while how they function they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month and then they leave that product to produce a new one it seems like they have a new player being introduced every few months their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of and if you do they will simply say you need to send it to the factory occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free though be smart stick to a creative the new toshiba gigabeat s or clench your fists an ipod ||| 0

i ordered this mount for a sharp 20 inch lcd and it 's not that great it was very easy to install however the arm when fully outstretched does not sit level thus when the tv is pulled away from the wall the set is not level and very annoying to look at i do n't believe this is a fault in the actual part but the design of the arm this was relatively inexpensive for a wall mount and you get what you pay for ||| 0
i 'd recommend selecting a different security cable product especially if you have a powerbook or macbook this one is poorly made even more poorly documented and may have permanently damaged my powerbook yes the product web site claims this model is compatible with the pb it 's unclear from the cryptic instruction diagram on the back of the packaging which direction is locked and which is unlocked hey would it be so bad to actually use to explain things even in 4 or 5 languages if you like the diagrams make no sense in the process of trying to get this to work it appears that the locking teeth chewed up the security slot of my powerbook it may have permanently damaged the slot needless to say i will attempt to return the product for a refund there are plenty of similar products on the market including others avaiable through amazon i 'd suggest trying one of those ||| 0
total garbage no only this thing is huge bigger than most players and it does n't have a belt clip or anything it sounds awful absolutely horrible the hiss others complained about is very loud it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible low dynamics and distorts easily this is a bad product that should be taken off the market it 's not even worth the price here heck even 1.99 would be a waste of money avoid ||| 0
it is a great idea with a few qualifiers i have found that the forward and reverse buttons do n't function for my video ipod or for my niece 's nano maybe it would for a player i have to pair the device to the ipod every time i turn it on the bluetooth transponder will drain the ipod 's battery even though it has it 's own battery sound quality is decent ||| 0
it was great at first until the connector to ipod break by itself the bluetooth signal was n't the best it loses signal constantly i had to and paired it up several times over a month period the high price imuffs from gives a better promise with the ability to stop your ipod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone its bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on ipods with dock connectors likely will not break as easily i sure hope logiteh will follow suit in this trend ||| 0

i have had this tv for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out i called samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty they said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours 72 hours later still no call i again called samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and i would be called in 24 hours still no call this was repeated 5 times and each time i asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area fianlly after 6 calls samsung referred me to another center i then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem i described when i made the appointment i needed a new bulb duh and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb i specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when i made the appointment why they did n't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment i do n't know i called samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support my fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and i am back on the samsung support again now i realize that even though the set does did have a good picture etc if you ca n't see it it does n't matter i now have a very expensive paperweight for me samsung support has been a black hole and i have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future what happens after the warranty is over and i have to pay for a new bulb every three months if this sounds like i am not very happy with the situation that is the truth i am tired of samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point i agree you solve the problem by doing the right thing the first time or the second time or third time etc i am hoping maybe the eighth time is the charm with my samsung experience ||| 0

i am somewhat computer savvy i understand the the ip address assigned in installation needs to match what my own router assigned for an ip address they do n't match and i ca n't figure out how to change it i called netgear 4 days ago for help and they said their senior tech '' would have to call me back still waiting for that call back to staples it goes the installation appeared successful but whenever i try to print it says error printer is busy '' the instruction manual for this is laughable if you 're not an advance level it person do n't try it ||| 0

i had the same problems as already stated i am currently having the volume issue as well and yes my batteries are weak the light is on the first unit i bought lasted two weaks and then there was no sound at all i called sharper image and they agreed to send a replacement i waited two weeks and nothing i called again and they had no record of my previous phone call they did send a replacement and told me it would be sent overnight if deemed appropriate by management '' it was not shipped overnight bottom line this product is awful do not buy i regret it ! it is worth it to spend more money on a different product this only has a 90 day warranty and it does n't last quite that long ||| 0
i waited 10 days for this to arrive the first time i plugged it in it ran for 2 minutes i typed dear and the machine typed wcm '' when i tried to erase wcm '' the erase mechanism did not work i turned the machine off and when i switched it back on the carriage went to the far left and will not move ie i can not type or use the machine in any way when the machine came two of the keys were knocked loose and i had to stick them back on now when i look at the machine i can see it is assymetrical there is a gap in the base so it must have been dropped or damaged somewhere this is not acceptable but i have no way to contact whoever mstasad is i have a huge project to do over the labor day weekend but i do n't have a typewriter that works i feel cheated and am very ||| 0

i bought these batteries on what was writen on their packaging it was not true to what was said these batteries died after only 25 minutes in my digital camera and a set of duracell ultras that are not rechargeable lasted longer do not always believe what you read make sure you have the ability to return items and is with this case they went back i went with a set of energizers and they last much longer with the power being the smae as these monster brand ||| 0
i purchased the zen nano four months ago it was working then total system failure at first i thought the battery was dead but a new battery did n't help the screen would flash on and then off it will not boot up plugging it into the computer did no good it could not be reconized or accessed it goes in the trash in addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored also the output volumn was to low i would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise it was n't up to the task now it is landfill ||| 0
i had to buy a new one and i chose another brand logitech this time there is no button so the batteries run out if you do n't take them out i think the buttons are pressed during transportation now the battery contacts are not functioning properly and i had the same problem described in a recent review i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen '' ||| 0
do not buy this may be the worst product i 've ever bought it has never worked properly i 've kept fresh batteries in it but it 's still no good within 10 feet of the laptop i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen awful product believe the bad reviews it 's worse than they describe the only positive thing i can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy my cat loves the laser pointer ||| 0
do not buy this mouse ! this mouse has given me nothing but frustration 1. the front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time 2. battery life is horrible like 2 weeks 3. when your mouse is idle for 8 minutes it goes into an automatic sleep mode the manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to revive '' it but when i do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen so i have to reboot my computer absolutely the worst ! ! ||| 0

got it home and it had poor focus the center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus the next morning the focus problem was gone go figure the big problem for me was the time it took to change channels a full 3 seconds went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs well i took it back and went to walmart and got a sanyo for 270 good set with quick channel change it also has an optical digital outputwhich the toshiba did not the sanyo also has a full one year warrenty sound on both tvs is fine a small point the toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit mute ||| 0
i posted a review two weeks ago but it has n't appeared so i 'm trying again i bought this lock two years ago it has always been difficult to remove note despite what some other reviewers seem to think it does not have a motion detector that 's a different lock recently the lock decided to remain firmly inside my ibook despite my efforts to remove it after a fruitless call to targus 's customer support i finally got it out that took over 30 minutes of struggle my next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw apparently the targus lock is not a good fit for ibooks i 'm going to send mine back and demand compensation if you own an ibook i strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than targus ||| 0

it 's partly my fault of course i bought this to use on my motorcycle i thought the small size especially the flat body would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag i also bought a special handlebar mount for it unfortunately i 've had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes whether you 're driving a car or a motorcycle it 's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route maybe it was intended for pedestrians only the user interface for the gps is not intuitive at least not for me worse still it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes the garmin helpline in the uk could only tell me to reset the machine each time not very helpful my guess is that the combination of palm pc and gps was too much for garmin to handle they should probably just stick to gps ||| 0
i use it for my zen microphoto and it does not work at all it has the lowest battery life used it for twenty mintues and it started to get worse and worse there is no possible way of getting rid of the static unless you are the player below the transmitter which is obviously dangerous while driving you can only tune it to four stations which are 88.1 88.3 88.5 and 88.7 which is absolutely pointless approach to an fm transmitter i seriously regret every buying this transmitter ||| 0
it 'll do in a pinch i hope there are better options at times the sound is clear however most of the time the static is either 1 just annoying or 2 the static is so loud and piercing that you have to turn it off i hope there are units that broadcast a stronger signal or have another way to connect in order to provide a constant tolerable sound quality i would recommend spending some more money to get a reliable device ||| 0

i dislike ipods so i figure i try something else and hope for the i was wrong itunes and ipods are definitely much basically this device is a cheap piece of crap and it seems like sandisk 's approach is pros long battery life email tech support is quick and good but website support sucks bad cons it 's easy to setup but instruction manual is useless buttons are rigid and miniature and difficult to press with a skin on wheel is very stiff and offers very little functionality software is buggy and terrible freezes occasionally navigating through menus stutters and lags boot time is 10 seconds video mode has no options needs serious firmware updates time is listed only in settings menu useless tons of issues with playlists getting erased or not working properly every firmware update erases all your settings including radio presets and the list of issues goes on and on anyone who has reviewed this product positively obviously didnt do a thorough job because these issues exist and its definitely irritating i am extremely disappointed and will never buy a sandisk player ever again my suggestion is to try it out thorougly before you dont make the same mistake i did and trust other people 's lopsided ||| 0
the mouse worked well with my chipset but beaware that earlier bluetooth chipsets do not have the power to work with this mouse although the dongle that is bundled with this is excellent the mouse was very difficult to use and unresponsive at times requiring multiple clicks to choose items it was sluggish across the screen and very insensitive even after maxing out all the mouse settings in either direction looking through the forums at anycom informed me that many people had a similar problem and rma 's were being issued considering that these problems arose earlier last year i was upset that i was sold a defective product i just send my mouse back to newport california for a replacement the features are solid the size is acceptable but prone to cramping at first for a travel mouse it is exceptional being rechargeable via usb usuage with the usb cable attatched is ok but somewhat awkward as the cable comes from the head '' of the mouse not the tail '' would i buy again only if i did n't find another product that was rechargeable bluetooth and optical ||| 0
i bought this phone for a situation i then discovered that the maximum number of characters i could enter into a speed dial entry the number itself not the name is 24 characters a telephone calling card number is 25 characters long 26 if you program a pause a space for this phone between the phone number and the card when i called polycom about it i was told that not everyone uses calling cards funny i 've been issued a calling card at every company for which i 've worked going back 25 years this is the only phone i 've ever owned well since the 80 's into which i could not program my calling cards pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss on top of that when i try and enter the calling card number and card id by hand it never takes '' on the first try the network does n't recognize the card id and pin the first time i enter them i have to do it twice i 've tried this a number of times and it 's consistent for that matter the sound quality especially through the headset also purchased from polycom is not that good of course that could be because the headset jack is loose '' you can easily move the jack from side to side which makes the sound quality even worse i regret having made this purchase i 'm going to scrap it and look for a new one from a different manufacturer the only reason i gave it one star is because the site interface here wo n't let me give it no stars ||| 0

i 've had this mouse for about a month use it with my mac at home and i 'm exhausted it feels very nice in the hand and i really like the scrolling ball feature hence the 2 stars but it 's just not predictable sometimes it glides along smoothly most other times it tracks across the monitor like you 're mousing over pebbles i 've tried a number of different surfaces desktop light woodgrain smooth medium gray fabric mouse pad mouse pad made specifically for optical mice better than the other two and i have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission to no avail it still lags and i have a hard time honing in on an object to select it or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle i use photoshop and other mousing intensive apps all day at work and at home and i need a mouse that is precise for silhouetting this just is n't it you should n't have to think about mousing when you 're doing it it should just happen immediately and smoothly corded or cordless and a newer '' technology should work better that a gummed up old '' tracking ball mouse ! maybe it does n't like my older mac maybe it 's the bluetooth adapter whatever it is it 's not working i 'll be trying the logitech next it has a recharging base and is laser instead of optical i 'm hoping the higher price will translate into better performance ||| 0
for my powerbook my first bluetooth mouse a macally bt worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk so for the replacement i read the reviews and went with the kensington bluetooth mini primarily for the functionality i like the size and shape the switch and the scroll works just keen however tracking is a nightmare especially when cpu usage is high applications like photoshop acrobat or using a vpn to access my work files i tried troubleshooting adjusting the track rate but nope the cursor continues to stutter across the screen with this mouse i think i 'm going to throw in the towel and go back to wired ||| 0
one of the reasons i chose this mouse was because apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling it turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others it jerks one line at a time the clicking is quite loud i might add also i have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if i do n't sometimes just clicking on system preferences corrects the problem but if i had it to do over i 'd buy something else ||| 0
i bought this in april for my new canon and it worked great until several months ago when i would go back to scroll through the recently taken pictures on my camera it would start saying data corrupted '' it started out slowly then it would lose every third picture i tried to reformat the card and got an error message now my camera does not recognize it nor does the camera software on my computer it was a wonderful card while it lasted but i too am hesitate to get another one hopefully mine was a lemon too then again ||| 0
this seemed like a great card at a great price unfortunately after 4 months during the middle of a paid shoot all of the images instantly dissappeared i stopped using the card put it aside until i got home i tried to use software to recover the images only a few could be recovered the rest were gone i 've not been able to the card in either a canon eos digital rebel or using software on my computer the card is now completely all of my older cards continue to work just fine hopefully this is just a lemon although i need to replace it and am obviously apprehensive about purchasing another one from sandisk ||| 0
i purchased 3 of these aps with the expectation to replace 3 cisco b '' aps and drop in the setup used radius for authentication which is claimed to be supported in both the online info and docs after config the web ui constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to the system would work one quark was the ip address field for the radius server would n't accept more than one character in the forms up and running however upon reboot the loses it radius info and then can not authenticate a client again showstopper after logging this with netgear support their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support while this would be fine if it was a config issue it 's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase they give no further support now i would highly recommend against the extra cost of this unit given it 's buggy and has poor support config is difficult i had to learn how to use the command line config the upgrades are not well documented they imply you have to import some obscure file with tftp you do n't but however the unit does have good range and works no radius of course in a basic config ||| 0
first a disclaimer i know very little about telephone headsets but decided to buy one because i had a series of long telephone meetings coming up i walked to my local staples store expecting to find a variety of prices and products and thinking that i 'd pay perhaps 30 to 50 at the low end of the market at the store i found that only the headsets were that cheap and the only model that worked on a real land line was the plantronics on display it was priced at 130 canadian since work was paying for it i did n't mind spending the extra money but expected that at that price the quality and ease of use would be quite high when i brough it back to the office and installed it i found that the regular handset and the headset can not be plugged in at the same time that means that every time i want to use the headset i need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires the volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low even when i turn up the volume controls to max the people i spoke with complained enough that i switched back to my regular handset the microphone although it 's somewhat adjustable is short and inflexible enough that i ca n't get it very close enough to my mouth when i try to move it closer the earpiece turns and slips off my ear the headset itself that is the plastic adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head it might have been better to design it like a regular earphone unit so that it would be more balanced and stay secure i do n't know whether these comments apply only to the or to most headsets for traditional phones in general overall however if i 'd been buying the with my own money i would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset ||| 0
since i first wrote this review i discovered that the fault was not with the scanner but with my computer after formatting my computer i was able to install the scanner and software without any problems i am still learning to use it but so far i have decided not to return it it works well and i like it very much i apologize if my review has negatively effected anyone 's choice ||| 0
i have approximately slides to scan i purchased the 4850 and after about slides began to get three to four dark blue lines across the image after reporting it to hp they sent me a replacement tma the new tma worked fine for the first 450 slides and then bingo i now am getting two dark blue lines again i think the machine is not engineered to handle the work load i have ||| 0
my daughter really did n't use it that much but within about 5 weeks it started to fall apart the wood veneer on the base pulled up and splintered from tightening the strings to tune it a low price for a guitar but i do n't think it 's even worth this price ||| 0
these phones had so much static you could not hear ! ! ! we ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use ! ||| 0
i bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a phone with answering capability turns out i can not keep it due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me the good it 's nice looking compact has good sound and has a selection of cute little ringtones the bad this machine will not record incoming messages silently it broadcasts both the ogm and the icm being left by the caller through the speaker there is no way i know of to defeat this you can turn the volume down from loud to medium loud but you can not set the machine to record messages silently in the background do you think you might ever not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your recorder would you ever want to sleep without being disturbed by the sound of incoming messages then this one is n't for you mine is for sale ||| 0
my very first cell phone was motorola and it served me great so i became attached to the brand based on that experience and for that reason alone bought motorola digital system as we 've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks the battery life got very short very soon too i was told i need to get different batteries nih instead of nicd naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too as we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 2 line phone i decided to get motorola digital phone and remained loyal to motorola and boy was i wrong again what others are saying about caller id not showing as soon as i have another phone on the same line besides motorola md 7091 is true in my case too i do n't get it does motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones this is really cheap trick naturally i could blame all this on poor quality of nicd batteries wireless network microwaves and phone company and other brands ' phones connected to my line but what is the common thread through the entire ordeal motorola i will give other brands a try now not yet sure which ones ||| 0
now imagine my astonishment after receiving this beautifully designed futuristic looking set from my favorite communication device manufacturers i set it up only to realize that the cordless phone only works when there is a direct line of site to the base ! unbelievable ! ! i live in a compact apartment ok and believe me when i say it is n't 20 feet between the base and my bed room and last night after setting up i retreated to my room took up the cordless handset to make a call only to realize that there was no connection to the base this phone in a nutshell looks good but it sucks ! ! ||| 0
i had high hopes for this case when i bought it but it just has n't worked out the leather has a nice feel and my ipaq fit snugly in it 's slot however the stylus on my ipaq was impossible to get to without partially removing the ipaq from it 's case this became so frustrating that i eventually discontinued using this case it does have three slots for credit cards and a larger slot that you could tuck a few folded dollar bills or business cards in maybe a different model of ipaq would work better but it has n't been a good fit for me ||| 0
i agree with the previous review this phone cord worked twice now it only retracts about half way and keeps getting worse i 'm returning it for a refund do n't waste your time with this ||| 0
i am on my second one and i will be returning this one also both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that i was so mad i almost threw it against the wall i thought the first one was a defect but then when i got the second one i realized it was a design flaw if you buy the targus one keep your receipt because i guarantee you will be returning it what i do n't get is how targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it satisfaction guaranteed what a ||| 0
ipods are the leading sellers of portable players and everybody knows that but guess what ipod does not support the leading and best quality video format divx and avi hmm thats kinda retarded no if any of you out there use file sharing programs such as limewire or any torrent programs if u download any of those videos the best ones and the majority are divx and avi too bad for you unless ur willing to sit around for an hour or two and convert your video to also the video you convert may have a few complications the audio and video may not be sychronized at all and for those of you who have already purchased this piece of garbage im sorry and i have great sympathy for you so if ud like a program that will convert ur video for free and results in pretty good quality go to and search for jodix video converter this is not from speculations i have experienced this all myself with my own purchase of the video ipod and was a decision i regreted suggestion check out the creative zen vision m sure it may be thicker but the price is amazing for its features and conveniences of transfering files into it ||| 0
i bought with lots of ilussion this this ipod i put all my music in it and use it ! ! after a 5 months it stop working it did n't charge the battery i took it to best buy where i bought it and they told me that it has external damage '' and didn ' repair it i send it to apple service and return it without services because the same reason my ipod did n't have that damage it has only a few scratches on the screen after lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it i would have to pay us 250.00 that is almost what it cost new terrible service from short do n't recommended now i 'm looking for another option for player to buy if you know one please let me know it ||| 0
like other fm transmitters i have tried this one leaves much to be desired living in a major urban area i was unable to find any fm channel that did not produce significant static and generally poor sound quality product is easy to use but i consider the sound quality unacceptable ||| 0
the phone worked for a month or two and then the handset stopped seeing the base when i followed the instructions in the manual to fix this the handset to the base neither could see each other the base still gets the signal and works with speakerphone but that is useless to me since i need the handset when i contacted uniden through their email support i got no response i will be buying another phone that is not a uniden ||| 0
i 'm pissed i feel i 've been ripped off the party vendor delivered a defective unit i want to return it i have been unable to determine how to return this unit for a refund i may never buy through amazon again ||| 0
this product did not reliabley work in a new sony psp running the current sony software do n't know if the design is flawed or the unit i received was defective ||| 0
got it and plugged it into my ipod and there was a major incompatibility the screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the ipod but when i went to record i received an error message that the ipod could not locate a microphone perhaps an ipod problem the ipod is a generation 40 gig that is fully updated i think belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new ipods with the exception of the minis have not been able to resolve the issue i am sure ipod will state that it is a belkin problem and that belkin will throw the ball back to ipod ||| 0
i just received my pair today and i have to say i 'm extremely dissapointed yes they are comfortable but the bass is almost absent no matter how far you jam them into your ears the bass is n't nearly what it were hyped to be it definently is n't enough for the amount of mid hi 's they produce unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max i 'd recommend another pair of earphones if you 're just looking for comfort and you do n't like hardly any bass these are your headphones but as others said you can find much better earphones for a much lower price ||| 0
the first thing i did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually was an apple product its really cheap looking looks like something you 'd find for at a flea market or in the stocking stuffers '' section of the dollar store at christmas time the nano is small so almost anything will hold it including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit this looks more like the freebie armband that should come free with the unit certainly not a accessory it just cheapens the apple image if oem apple products are your thing then go ahead and try this but if you 're looking for something as sweet as your nano that stays put while you workout look for something else i 'm returning mine this weekend to spend my money elsewhere ||| 0
3 more of the useless flimsy holders you get in the ipod box ! ||| 0
i had a very poor experience with the microsoft media center infrared keyboard and i wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would i thought get rid of all connection problems i was wrong the hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections as usual i was very careful i always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product i do n't want to fail the installation for a very simple reason the package does n't come cheap i am a software developer i have half a dozen computers at home and i did everything as instructed i found the software to be very average in terms of usability why do they try to do all these fancy effects but that 's not very important when it works fine unfortunately after just a couple of days the keyboard stopped working i finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer both step were required the switch did n't work same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective now the mouse keeps on dropping connections after a couple of hours of inactivity the mouse simply stops responding this is simply unacceptable logitech knows that this product does n't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it was n't tested properly it is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great do n't buy this product you could be very disappointed note that i have seen another installation done by professional windows system administrators that had the exact same problems now do n't get me wrong the hardware is very nice i would highly recommend the logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks which is great and had none of the issues i have mentioned there ||| 0
this hardware is and i have heard very good things about the version of the mouse when it 's connected and working it does its job very well unfortuntately the set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively at seemingly random intervals the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether if this happens during gameplay you 're in a bad way the keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug when it comes off of its sleep state it will double the first key you press i have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue add in that the setpoint software for the lcd screen only fully works with two pieces of software musicmatch and windows messenger and you have a very disappointing desktop package the is a great mouse on its own but stay away from this bluetooth combo it is unstable and very frustrating to use ||| 0
the unit works fine as a bluetooth radio the software and drivers ! ! ! ! do not install properly at all ! ! ! i am a network administrator pretty savvy about pcs i could not come up with any scenario to get the software to work ! ! ! save your money and just buy the unit forget the software ||| 0
does not work at all dont throw away your money should read 0 star ||| 0
i had vonage since april 2006. i finally switched back to qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone my cell phone as my vonage line did n't work with tech support here is my experience 1 it took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone over to vonage do n't be too excited about getting the first month if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over 2 after my number was finally switched over outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about seconds incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute this resulted in having to call the person back saying sorry the call was we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems '' this is with the highest speed cable internet service available download upload and a wireless 'g ' system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while i had vonage problems i spent no less than 4 5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem after talking with tech support sometimes the problem would be fixed while i was on the phone with but return shortly thereafter 3 as a result of the problems i had i asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working be warned they are very about providing any credits for poor or no service i spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given after the problem had been fixed temporarily i called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month not previous months of no or poor service they are not customer friendly about providing refunds for poor or no service 4 finally in september still with dropped calls from vonage i switched back to qwest to get reliable phone service i found customer service there has improved and is much better than vonage and they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back in the end i am happy to pay the extra after the first 3 months free to get phone service that works i notice that 5 of the extra cost is for fees etc that the phone company has to charge but vonage does not which is unfortunate in any case i guess you get what you pay for one last thing vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan they never will this means eventually they will either go out of business or have to raise rates save yourself the problems i pay the extra to get phone service that works ||| 0
i bought vonage service thinking that finally there is a company which will let me control everything from their web portal and provide features that traditional phone companies do not good thing i kept my number with traditional phone company and got a second line with vonage its voice quality was really bad and cancelling it was a pain to say the least it took me 4 months to cancell it waiting forever on hold please read internet before you decide to save '' money ||| 0
stay away from vonage ! after more than 1 month still do n't have phone number transferred ca n't get thru to customer service very long wait paying 2 phone bills so much for saving cost and service called to cancel service and customer service rep promised to put on hold until phone number transfer is done finally something positive from customer service department ||| 0
very disappointing speakers ! rip off i returned them 1. satellites produce static noise even with the computer turned off you have to press the mute button to get rid of it 2. extremely rumble base not crisp even turned all the way down it is too prominent maybe good for war games 3. missing mid tone satellites sound like they are coming out off a tin can 4. volume is a bit underpowered will not knock your socks off ||| 0
i too bought one and had the headphone jack become loose i bought another thinking i had a faulty one but now i 'm having the same issue with this one the loose jack causes the reception to go in and out and finally just out completely i agreed with the previous opinions on this fatal flaw ||| 0
1. there was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when i tried multiple jacks for the base 2. phone features worked as advertised but the voice enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse 3. it was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset i returned it mainly because of the buzzing ||| 0
i bought this and found that if you like to burn your own cd 's to play in it it has a problem reading the tracks it sometimes spins up and does n't play and it always has a very audible noise on spin up and track find i usually wake to that sound before the music starts i am not a light sleeper this is my second one and i 've basically been using it for the radio wake function for the last few months do yourself a favor and find a different product ||| 0
this product does not have the skip feature included in the product descriptio ||| 0
your buying 128 mb worth of frustration and 10 worth of gas from back and forth to i bought my creative muvo and had it for a month or so loved it had everything i needed great worked great one day plugged it in to put a song on it and all of the sudden it starts smoking big hole in it from all the smoke so i return it at walmart for a new one two days later i plug it in my usb to put a song on it smokes again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i returned it and got my money back got an ipod shuffle buy that much better player wont start on fire ||| 0
the keyboard and mouse work fine except for some completely absurd reason logitech decided to remove the insert and escape keys from the regular keyboard and make them little buttons on the top of the keyboard instead look at the picture and you will see what i mean the delete key is and takes up the space where the insert key would be insert is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button escape is in the usual place but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key very annoying definately returning it ||| 0
ordered it took about 5 days to get to me and it 's corrupted and can not format itself and can not put files on it ||| 0
i was really happy with the mouse for all of 10 minutes the scroll wheel is really push happy '' such that when i roll the wheel the middle button registers a click '' very often in order to prevent the inadvertant click i have to roll the wheel with the lightest of light touches it 's significantly more senstive than my older logitech wheel and was really really annoying to have the browser repeatedly register the middle button which is unix is the default paste '' so i 'd have pages and pages of text that i selected '' be pasted on to the browser or editor while what i really wanted was just to scroll the buffer ! ! ! too bad the mouse was really high quality overall ||| 0
the jbl speakers worked fine for 3 weeks and all of a sudden they quit in the future i will buy this type of merchandise locally so that i have some recourse ||| 0
i was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews however i have been extremely disappointed in them i may have had too high of expectations but these things put out no bass whatsoever it just sounds muffled and cruddy and the overall sound is extremely poor i 'm really surprised as i 've owned jbl speakers in my car that i was extremely pleased with so i 'm amazed at the lacking quality in these i would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included ||| 0
these speakers sound great but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that 's a so you reach for your phones and no place to plug them in ! how lame is that also whoever designed the knob is an idiot the thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it the whole speaker just slips away from you they 're so light that they do n't have enough resistance to stay put so you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other unless you velcro them to your desk or something too bad because like i said they sound great ||| 0
agree with the prior reviewers i can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses ! ||| 0
i have bought several of these some came in a fancy blister and others in a coushing bag stay away from those be sure you 're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different i give the generic two stars just because it works i give four stars to the original because as others reviewers have said it 's a little difficult to remove the card ||| 0
i bought this for easy transfer of pictures from my digital camera with sd memory card anywhere not home and sometimes from other peoples memory card xd and memory stick first of all i was disappointed with the flimsy plastic design and the size of it but it would have been ok if it worked ! doesnt read my sd card and as menetioned in other people 's review hard to insert and take out the cards ! i 'm scared if the cards get scratch and ruined whenever i do it i wish i have bought this after reading amazon reviews it 's useless now i 'm lost how i can get sd card work on this and if i do scared of frequent use for the flimsy design ||| 0
